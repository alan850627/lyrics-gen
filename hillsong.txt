All for love the Father gave
For only love could make a way
All for love the heavens cried
For love was crucified

Oh how many times have I broken Your heart
But still You forgive
If only I ask
And how many times have You heard me pray
Draw near to me

Everything I need is You
My beginning, my forever
Everything I need is You

Let me sing all for love
I will join the angels song
Ever holy is the Lord
King of Glory
King of all

All for a love a Saviour prayed
Abba Father have Your way
Though they know not what they do
Let the Cross draw man to You

Almighty God my Redeemer 
My hiding place, my safe refuge 
No other name like Jesus 
No power can stand against You 

My feet are planted on this rock 
And I will not be shaken 
My hope it comes from You alone 
My Lord and my salvation 

Your praise is always on my lips 
Your word is living in my heart 
And I will praise You with a new song 
My soul will bless You Lord 
You fill my life with greater joy 
Yes I delight myself in You 
And I will praise You with a new song 
My soul will bless You Lord 

When I am weak, You make me strong 
When I'm poor, I know I'm rich 
For in the power of Your name 
All things are possible


Did You rise the sun for me?
Or paint a million stars that I might
Know your majesty?
Is Your voice upon the wind?
Is everything I've known marked?
With my maker's fingerprints?

Breathe on me
Let me see Your face
Ever I will seek You


'Cause all You are, is all I want, always
Draw me close in Your arms
Oh God, I want to be with You

Can I feel You in the rain?
Abandon all I am to have You
Capture me again
Let the earth resound with praise
Can You hear as all creation lives
To glorify one name?


The holiest place there could ever be
All you can do is bow
Before the one who made heaven and earth
Before the Almighty God
For Him alone

Sing with the angels
Sing with the angels
Singing the name of the lord
Singing the name of the lord

For every soul 
He gave it all
Given for all of mankind
Eternal life is His alone
Given to all who believe 
In Him alone

Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus.


Oh Lord You've searched me
You know my way
You fail with my failure
I know You love me

Your holy presence
Surrounded me
In every season
I know You love me
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

You go before me
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
And I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done

And when the earth fails
Falls from my eyes
And You stand before me
I know You love me
Oh, I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done

You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done

I said on Sunday how much I want revival
But then on Monday I can't even find my bible
Where's power, the power of the cross in my life?
I'm sick of playing the game of religion

I'm tired of loosing my reason for living
Where's power, the power of the cross in my life?
I'm not content just to walk through my life
Giving in to the lies walking in compromises

Now we cried out as a generation that was lost
But now is found in the power of the cross
We believe in You, we believe in the power of the cross and it?s true
We believe in You, so we lay down the cause that the cross might be found in You

I'm not satisfied living in my own ways
I'm not satisfied to do church and walk away
I'm not satisfied there's no love in my life but You
I'm not satisfied living in yesterday?s hour
I'm not satisfied to have the form but not power
I'm not satisfied oh Lord I am crucified in You


Better than the riches of this world 
Better than the sound of my friends voices 
Better than the biggest dreams in my heart and that's just the start 
Better than getting what I say I need 
Better than living the life that I want to 
Better than the love anyone could give 
Your love is 

You hold me now in Your arms You never let me go 

And You oh Lord made the sunshine the moonlight and the night sky 
You give me breath and all Your love 
I give my heart to You 
Because I can't stop falling in love with You 
I'll never stop falling in love with You

Lord I come
Lord I thank you
For your love
For this grace divine
Love and mercy
Undeserving
You gave it all
The greatest sacrifice

You were wounded
For my sin
You were bruised
For all my shame
You were broken
For my healing
Only by the cross 
I am saved

You're the mender of the broken
To every outcast
A friend and comforter

I come boldly to your presence
Lord I bow before your throne
You're my healer
My redeemer
You're my hope, my life, my heart

You hear the cry of the broken
You hear the cry of the broken
You hear the cry of the broken
You answer the cry of the broken
You answer the cry of the broken
You answer the cry of the broken

This is my prayer in the desert
And all that's within me feels dry
This is my prayer in the hunger in me
My God is a God who provides

And this is my prayer in the fire
In weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved
Of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord through the flames

And I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon forged against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

And this is my prayer in the battle
And triumph is still on it's way
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
So firm on His promise I'll stand

I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon forged against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing

I will bring praise
No weapon forged against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

And this is my prayer in the harvest
When favor and providence flow
I know I'm filled to be emptied again
The seed I've received I will sow

While lost in my sin He
Raised me and made me live

My soul magnifies the Lord
My heart joys in God my Savior
For He lifts the lowly

He's done great things for me
I will sing, praising evermore
He is mighty and Holy is His name

I will lift my head up high
Praising Jesus through each trial
Though I have not seen Him

I'm reaching for the prize...
I'm giving everything...
I give my life for this...
It's what I live for.

Nothing will keep me from...
All that you have for me...
You hold my head up high...
I live for you...

Greater is He that's living in me
Than he that is in the world.

Faith...I can move the mountain...
I can do all things through Christ, I know
Faith...Standing and believing...
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me

Hope has found its home within me
Now that I've been found in You
Let all that I am be all You want me to be
'Cause all I want is more of You

Let Your presence fall upon us
I want to see You face to face
Let me live forever lost in Your love
'Cause all I want is more of You
All I want is more of You

I'm living for this cause
I lay down my life
Into Your hands
I'm living for the truth
The hope of the world
In You I'll stand
'Cause all I want is You
All I want is
All I want is You

Whisper my own love song
With all my heart I'll sing
For You, my dad and King

I'll live for all my days
To put a smile on Your face
And when we finally meet
It'll be for eternity

And oh, how wide You open up Your arms
When I need Your love
And how far You would come
If ever I was lost

Is undying love

Amazing love
Now what else shall I need
Your name brings life
Its more than the air I breath

My world was changed
When your life you gave for me
My purpose found
And all that you want for me

And Ive found myself in you
And Ive found myself in you

Take me to a place
Where I can see you face to face
And all I want to do
All I want to do
Is worship you

Would you believe me if I said
That we are the ones who can make the change 
In the world today
Would you believe me if I said 
That all of the dreams in your heart 
Can come true today
Would you believe me if I said
That life could be all that you want it to be today

And if I had wings I would fly 
'cause all that I need You are 
And if the world caved in around me 

To You I'd still hold on 
'cause Your all that I believe 
And the one that created me 
Jesus because of You I'm Free 

Would you believe me if I said
That God can make miracles happen today
Would you believe me if I said
That you don't need to wait for the answer before
You step out in faith 
Would you believe me if I said
That nothin' is ever impossible for God 

Just live you life with God inside
You won our regret one moment of it 
And give all that you can for God. for God

Will I was in need
I needed a friend
I was alone
I needed a hand
I was going down
But someone rescued me
My God cares too much to say
His mercies are new every day
I get down to pray
And then help is on it's way
I walk by faith
And not by sight
If things go wrong
It'll be alright
'Cause someone greater is watching over me
My God cares too much to say
His mercies are new every day
I get down to pray
And then help is on it's way
Now in faith I believe
That I've got everything I need
I walk by faith and not by what I see
I've got friends in high places
I've got someone I can call
I've got someone watching over me



A thousand times I've failed
Still Your mercy remains
And should I stumble again
Still I'm caught in Your grace

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

My heart and my soul, I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Your will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

My heart and my soul, I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

And the cry of my heart
Is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out

My soul cries out to You
My soul cries out to You
To You, to You

My heart and my soul, I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

And the cry of my heart
Is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

And the cry of my heart
Is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out

From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out
From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out

If love endured that ancient cross
How precious is my Savior's blood
The beauty of heaven wrapped in my shame
The image of love upon death's frame

If having my heart was worth the pain
What joy could You see beyond the grave
If love found my soul worth dying for

How wonderful, how glorious
My Savior's scars victorious
My chains are gone, my debt is paid
From death to life and grace to grace

If heaven now owns that vacant tomb
How great is the hope that lives in You
The passion that tore through hell like a rose
The promise that rolled back death and its stone

If freedom is worth the life You raised
Oh where is my sin, where is my shame?
If love paid it all to have my heart

How wonderful, how glorious
My Savior's scars victorious
My chains are gone, my debt is paid
From death to life and grace to grace

When I see that cross, I see freedom
When I see that grave, I'll see Jesus
And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace

When I see that cross, I see freedom
When I see that grave, I'll see Jesus
And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace

How my soul will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace
How my soul will sing Your praise

How wonderful, how glorious
My Savior's scars victorious
My chains are gone, my debt is paid
From death to life and grace to grace


Saved by your mercy
Found in your grace
Totally surrendered to your embrace
And there's nothing more than you

See your perfection
I'm lost in your peace
Your faithfulness sings over me
And your love is the light of my soul

And I lift my eyes to you
Creator of the world

And I stand in awe of you
Of your glory
And I live to worship you
Son of god, king of heaven

And the angels round your throne
Cry out holy
To the one who is to come
Hear us sing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah


Oh blessed Lamb once slain
Will reign for evermore
His hands once bound now save
Our God will never fail

He is Lord
He is Lord
Sings my soul
He is the Lord
And He lives
Yes He lives
I?m alive
Cause Jesus lives

'Tis at the cross of Christ
Where earth and heaven meet
Where sin is overcome
To God the victory

And now
Let the earth resound with praise
For our Saviour God He reigns
He is high and lifted up
Arise
For the King of glory waits
He is coming back again
He is coming back again



Come on everyone on your feet
This is good news sounds so sweet
Jesus is the Lord of all
And He will answer when you call
When Jesus rules inside your heart
That is where His Kingdom starts
Jesus is the coming King
And this is what the angels sing
He shall be called
Wonderful ,Counsellor ,Mighty God
And His mighty Kingdom
His Kingdom will never end
And He shall be called
The Prince of Peace
Justice and Righteousness
And His mighty Kingdom
His Kingdom will never end

Hear our prayer, Spirit, come

Only You can fill my deep hunger
My heart burns, my heart burns

Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes, let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God

You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days
Oh so highly exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor

Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God

You're altogether lovely
Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

Well, I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

Well, I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

Well, I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

Well, I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross


I have never walked on water
Felt the waves beneath my feet
But at Your word Lord
I'll receive Your faith to walk on oceans deep

And I remember how You found me
In that very same place
All my failings surely would have drowned me
Still You made a way

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason
I'm kneeling again at your throne
Where would I be without You
Here in my life
Here in my life

You have said that all the heavens
Sing for joy at one who finds the
Way to freedom, truth of Jesus
Brought from death into this life

And I remember how You saw me
Through the eyes of Your grace
And though the cost was Your beloved for me
Still You made a way

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason
I'm kneeling again at your throne
Where would I be without You
Here in my life
Here in my life

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason
I'm kneeling again at your throne
Where would I be without You
Here in my life
Here in my life

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason
I'm kneeling again at your throne
Where would I be without You
Here in my life
Here in my life

You are my freedom
Jesus You're the reason
I'm knelling again at your throne
Where would I be without You
Here in my life
Here in my life

Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like You have loved me
Break my heart for what breaks Yours
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity

Lord, I give You my heart
I give You my soul, I live for You alone
Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

Have Your way
Have Your way, have Your way


Say the world
And I will sing for you
Over oceans deep 
I will follow
If each star was a song
And every breath of wind,praise
It will still fail by far to say 
All my heart contains
I simply live,I simply for you

As the glory of your presence 
Now fills this place
In worship we will meet you face to face
There is nothing in this world
To which you can be compared
Glory on glory,
Praise on praise
You bind the broken hearted 
And save all my tears
By your word,
You set the captives free
There is nothing in this world 
That you cannot do
I simply live,I simply live for you


I will love You Lord, my strength
I belong to You
I will bless You while I live
And I will lift my hands up in Your name

Jesus, You alone are holy
You alone are holy
Name above every name
Lord Jesus, You alone are worthy
You alone are worthy
Jesus, the Lamb that was slain

Nailed to the cross for me
Died and rose again
You redeemed me to the Father by Your blood
You cleansed me from all sin

Beauty for ashes, joy for my pain
You've given me wings to fly again
Strength for today, a dance for my sorrows
Because of you, because of you

Shades of gray turn to color
Dark of night breaks to day

It's a new day, it's a new day
Shadows rise at the glory of the Son
It's a new day, it's a new day
The past has gone and life has just begun

Hope for my future, my life's made brand new
Because of you, because of you
Chains of fear turn to freedom
Silence breaks into praise

It's a new day, it's a new day
It's a new day, since you came my way

Shades of gray turn to color
Dark of night breaks to day
Chains of fear turn to freedom



There's a light in the darkness that shines
Giving hope to all the world
Hope to all the world
There's a door that's been opened to all
Into a new and living way
A new and living way

Praise the name of Jesus
Perfect Redeemer
Star of the morning
Yesterday, today and forever
Jesus the same
Jesus the same

There's a fire that burns in our hearts
To see the lost return to the Father
It's a passion that's not of our own
We have seen it in the Son
In the face of the Son

Wonderful Counselor
Mighty God
Eternal Father
Prince of Peace

Covered by Your love
You're my deepest dream I know
Your love so strong, spirit come

You lift me up to heaven's door

Every beat of my heart, breath that I take
Through the seasons that change, Your love remains
My hiding place, my home falling in love

Stand by everything You said
Stand by the promises we made
Let go of everythingI've done
I'll run into Your open arms
And all I know


I love You more than life

Fall back on everything You've done
Fall back on everlasting arms
When all the world is swept away
You are all the things I need

You were the one on the cross
Lifted for all our shame?
How can it be
The scars in Your hands are for me?
You are the king of all

Of failing and falling

Perfect in love
Lord, You came to earth
To rescue me
You took my place upon that cross
The stains that held me back
Were washed away

I shall live to glorify You God
Hear my soul rejoice

The broken captives free

My heart is overwhelmed

Sings my soul of how
Your love has set me free
Sings my heart of how
Your mercy rescued me
Hear my cry of endless love
To my Savior and to my King
My heart is overwhelmed

Sings my soul of how
Your love has set me free

My one desire is to give You perfect praise

In my soul the reason why
In my life You are the fire that calls me on

We walk on this narrow road
Now restored as one we walk
In Your hope
And though 
Darkness fills our path
Fear won't fix its hold on us
For we know

Love will shine before us on our path
And guide our every step within the dark

We bear tidings of Your hope
Freedom from the sinner's plight
Through Your love
Our eyes set upon this task
Truth in hand as one we walk
We advance

Love will shine before us on our path
To guide our every step within the dark
To know You is our only cry
Knowing You our only cry
Knowing You our only cry

Lord here we are with humbled hearts
To see your will be done
Let love shape us to Your own design
To bear our Maker's sign

Love will shine before us on our path
To guide our every step within the dark
To know You is our only cry
Knowing You our only cry
Knowing You our only cry


In the quiet, in the stillness
I know that You are God
In the secret of Your presence
I know there I am restored

When You call I won't refuse
Each new day again I'll choose

There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise

In the chaos, in confusion
I know You're sovereign still
In the moment of my weakness
You give me grace to do Your will

When You call I won't delay
This my song through all my days

All my delight is in You Lord
All of my hope, all of my strength
All my delight is in You Lord forever more


What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Come to us, Lord
You reward those who earnestly, diligently seek You
I wanna see Your face, I wanna know Your way
Come to us, Lord

We want You more than this life
More than our way Your way is higher
Your thoughts are higher
We surrender here tonight

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand

Oceans will part nations come
At the whisper of Your call
Hope will rise, glory shine
In my life Your will be done

Oceans will part, nations come
At the whisper of Your call
Hope will rise, glory shown
In my life Your will be done, Your will be done
Will be done, Your will be done

As You open my eyes
To the work of Your hand
Jesus open my eyes
To the work of Your hand

Oceans will part, nations come
At the whisper of Your call
Hope will rise, glory shown
In my life Your will be done

Oceans will part, nations come
At the whisper of Your call
Hope will rise, glory shown
In my life Your will be done
In my life Your will be done
In my life Your will be done

I lay my life down at your feet
'Cause you're the only one I need
I turn to You and You are always there

In troubled times, it's You I seek
I put You first, that's all I need
I humble all I am all to You

One way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for
One way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for

You are always, always there
Everyhow and everywhere
Your grace abounds so deeply within me

You will never, ever change
Yesterday, today the same
Forever till forever meets no end

One way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for
One way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for
One way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for
One way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for

You are the way, the truth and the life
I live by faith and not by sight for You
We're livin' all for You
You are the way, the truth and the life
I live by faith and not by sight for You
We're livin' all for You
You are the way, the truth and the life
We live by faith and not by sight for You
We're livin' all for You
You are the way, the truth and the life
We live by faith and not by sight for You
We're livin' all for You

One way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for
One way, Jesus, You're the only one that I should live for
One way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for
One way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for

I can't believe the way Your love has got a hold on me
Each morning I wake to find You near
You lift me above my fears and set my feet on solid ground
All of my days belong to You

You are my all consuming fire

I stand here before You in wide opened wonder
Amazed at the glory of You
The power of heaven revealing Your purpose in me
As I'm reaching for You

All the earth come alive
Lift your eyes to the morning
Let our hearts beat again
With a lifeblood that never fails
Your love it will never fail

Breaking down the divide in a holy collision
The Divine in disguise
Took the cross for our sin and shame
Our God You will never fail

See the lost in return
Swing the doors ever wider
See the tide as it turns
Love and mercy is on the rise
As the world folds into Your light
All creation will see Your light

Hear the sound of freedom rise
As our song breaks the silence
Echoing the angel cry
Let us lift up Your holy Name
Hereafter to sing Your praise
Forever and ever

We will hold, we will love
We will fall in surrender
We will rise, we will run
We will live to declare Your Name
Forever to bring You praise
Forever we'll lift up Your Name

The universe on its knees
See the stars in surrender
God above kings and queens
Every idol will bend and break
But our God You will never fail
Forever and ever

We will hold, we will love
We will fall in surrender
We will rise, we will run
We will live to declare Your Name
Forever to bring You praise
Jesus, Jesus
We will hold, we will love
We will fall in surrender
We will rise, we will run
We will live to declare Your Name
Forever to bring You praise
Forever we'll lift up Your Name

Swing the doors wider
Sound the praise louder
All our hearts cry out
For the glory of Your Name
Our God You will never fail
Lift the Name higher
Shine the light brighter
All the earth cry out
For the glory of Your Name
Our God You will never fail
Forever we'll lift up Your Name


You were God from the outset
Powerful and creative
You who saw us here before You called
All the stars and the earth to existence

You are God You are holy
History is Your story
You who was and is
And who forever will be
God we live for Your glory

So we will run
All together our hearts aflame
With a fire that can't be tamed
Our God all glory to Your Name
Jesus

You are God You are freedom
You're alive now within us
You who saw us here before
You conquered the grave
And delivered on the promise

We will run
Our surrender to bring You fame
Our desire that You be praised
Our God all glory to Your Name
Jesus


God above all the world in motion
God above all my hopes and fears
And I don't care what the world throws at me now
I'm gonna be alright

Hear the sounds of the generations
Making loud our freedom song
All in all that the world would know Your name
It's gonna be alright

Cause I know my God saved the day
And I know His word never fails
And I know my God made a way for me
Salvation is here

Salvation is here
Salvation is here and He lives in me
Salvation is here
Salvation that died just to set me free
Salvation is here
Salvation is here and He lives in me
Salvation is here
Cause You are alive and You live in me


A Saviour on a hill dying for my shame
Could this be true?
Defies the world I see
Yet this is all my heart was longing for
To know You my Lord
To know You Lord

You deserve

You deserve all the praise

The heavens wept for You
The earth cried out "Could He be the One?"
For You so loved the world
You gave Your only Son to say
I love you so
Oh how I love You so

Hallelujah to the King
Hallelujah we will sing forever

And all humanity
Aches to find this beautiful love You give
We come to You again
To offer up our lives
To worship You alone
To worship You alone

Say the word and I will sing for You
Over oceans deep, I will follow
If each star was a song
And every breath of wind, praise
It would still fail by far to say
All my heart contains
I simply live, I simply live for You

As the glory of Your presence
Now fills this place
In worship, we will meet You face to face
There is nothing in this world
To which You can be compared
Glory on glory, praise upon praise
You bind the broken hearted
And save all my tears
By Your word, You set the captives free
There is nothing in this world
That You cannot do
I simply live, I simply live for You

Say the word and I will sing for You
Over oceans deep, I will follow
If each star was a song
And every breath of wind, praise
It would still fail by far to say

As the glory of Your presence
Now fills this place
In worship, we will meet You face to face
There is nothing in this world
To which You can be compared
Glory on glory, praise upon praise

And save all my tears
By Your word, You set the captives free
There is nothing in this world
That You cannot do
I simply live, I simply live for You



It used to be darkness
Without you I
I lived my life in blindness
But now I'm found

And I'll sing, sing I love you so
And I'll sing
Because the world can't take away
Your love

Found me in weakness
Broken
You came to me in kindness
And now I live

I give my life for you Lord
For all you've done

Hide me now
Under your wings
Cover me
Within your mighty hand

When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with you above the storm
Father you are king over the flood
I will be still and know you are God

Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know his power
In quietness and trust


There is Love
That came for us
Humbled to a sinner's cross
You broke my shame and sinfulness
You rose again victorious

Faithfulness none can deny
Through the storm
And through the fire
There is truth that sets me free
Jesus Christ who lives in me

You are stronger
You are stronger
Sin is broken
You have saved me
It is written
Christ is risen
Jesus You are Lord of all

No beginning and no end
You're my hope and my defense
You came to seek and save the lost
You paid it all upon the cross

So let Your Name be lifted higher
Be lifted higher
Be lifted higher


You broke the night like the sun
And healed my heart with Your great love
Any trouble I couldn't bear
You lifted me upon Your shoulders

A love that's stronger
A love that covers sin
And takes the weight of the world

I love You
All of my hope is in You
Jesus Christ, take my life
Take all of me

You stand on mountaintops with me
With You I walk through the valleys
You gave Your only son for me
Your grace is all I rely on

I love You so
And I give up my heart to say
I need You so
My everything


Searching the world
The lost will be found
In freedom we live
As one we cry out
You carried the cross
You died and rose again
My God
I'll only ever give my all

You sent Your Son
From heaven to earth
You delivered us all
It's eternally heard
I searched for truth
And all I found was You
My God
I'll only ever give my all

Jesus we're living for Your Name
We'll never be ashamed of You
Our praise, and all we are today

Take take take it all
Take take take it all

Running to the one
Who heals the blind
Following the shining light
In Your hands
The power to save the world
My life

You stood before creation
Eternity in your hand
You spoke the earth into motion
My soul now to stand

You stood before my failure
And carried the cross for my shame
My sin weighed upon your shoulders
My soul now to stand

So what could I say?
And what could I do?
But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to you

So I'll walk upon salvation
Your spirit alive in me
This life to declare your promise
My soul now to stand

So what could I say?
And what could I do?
But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to you

I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the one who gave it all
I'll stand
My soul Lord to you surrendered
All I am is yours


Found love beyond all reason
You gave Your life, you're all for me
And called me yours forever
Caught in the mercy fallout
I found hope found life
Found all I need
Cause you're all I need

The time has come
To stand for all we believe in
So I for one am gonna
Give my praise to You

Today today it's all or nothing
All the way
The praise goes out to you
Yeah all the praise goes out to you
Today today I live for one thing

Your grace is enough, more than I need
At your word I will believe

Let your spirit make me new

And I will fall at your feet
I will fall at your feet

Your presence in me, Jesus light the way
By the power of your word

By your spirit I am free

And I will fall at your feet

And I will worship you here
Oh lord

Freely you gave it all for us
Surrendered your life upon that cross

You are forever in my life
You see me through the seasons
Cover me with Your hand
And lead me in Your righteousness

And I look to You
And I wait on You

I'll sing to You, Lord, a hymn of love
For Your Faithfulness to me
And I'm carried in everlasting arms
You'll never let me go through it all

You are forever in my life
You see me through the seasons
Cover me with Your hand
And lead me in Your righteousness

And I, I look to You, oh

The precious blood of Jesus Christ redeems,
Forgiven I'm alive restored set free
Your Majesty resides inside of me
Forever I believe, forever I believe

Arrested by your truth and righteousness
Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness
Convicted by Your spirit led by your word
Your love will never fail, Your love will never fail

Cause I know You gave the world
Your only son for us
To know Your name
To live within the Saviours love
He took my place knowing He'd be crucified
And You loved, You loved
A people undeserving


Love unfailing
Overtaking my heart
You take me in
Finding peace again
Fear is lost in all you are

And I would give the world to tell you're story 
'Cause I know that you've called me
I know that you've called me
I've lost myself for good within your promise
And I won't hide it
I won't hide it 

Jesus, I believe in You
And I would go, to the ends of the earth
To the ends of the earth
For you alone are the son of God
And all the world will see
That You are God
You are God


Every knee will bow
And every tongue confess
That Jesus Christ is Lord
Lord and King

All glory to Your name
All honour to Your Majesty
Forever, forever
All praise to You alone

Every eye will see
And every heart will know
The beauty of the Lord
In all the earth

All praise to You alone
All praise to You alone
All praise to You alone


Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full, in his wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace


There's no silver or gold 
And no treasure untold
That could draw me away from Your heart
Neither love of myself
Or of anyone else will do 

Jesus nothing compares 
To this grace that rescues me 
Savior now and forever 
Your face is all I seek 

Now all I am
I lay at Your feet 
I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty 
One thing I know 
I find all I need
In Your unending love 
In Your unending love 

Letting go of my pride
I lay down my desires 
Just to worship in Spirit and truth 
More than all of my dreams 
More than fame I will seek You Lord

Jesus nothing compares 
To this grace that rescued me
Savior now and forever
Your face is all I seek

Now all I am
I lay at Your feet
I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty
One thing I know
I find all I need
In Your unending love
In Your unending love

Now all I am
I lay at Your feet
I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty
One thing I know
I find all I need
In Your unending love
In Your unending love

Let the weak say, "I am strong"
Let the poor say, "I am rich"
Let the blind say, "I can see"
It's what the lord has done in me

Let the weak say, "I am strong"
Let the poor say, "I am rich"
Let the blind say, "I can see"
It's what the lord has done in me

Hosanna, hosanna
To the lamb that was slain
Hosanna, hosanna
Jesus died and rose again

Into the river I will wade
And there my sins are washed away
From the heavens mercy streams
Of the savior's love for me

Hosanna, hosanna
To the lamb that was slain
Hosanna, hosanna
Jesus died and rose again

Hosanna, hosanna
To the lamb that was slain
Hosanna, hosanna
Jesus died and rose again

And I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of god
And I will sing salvation songs
Jesus christ has set me free

Hosanna, hosanna
To the lamb that was slain
Hosanna, hosanna
Jesus died and rose again

Hosanna, hosanna
To the lamb that was slain
Hosanna, hosanna
Jesus died and rose again

He rose again, oh oh

Your mercy found me upon the broken road
And lifted me beyond my failing, into Your glory
My sin and shame dissolved
And now forever Yours I?ll stand

In love never to end
To call You more than Lord
Glorious friend

So I throw my life upon all You are
?Cause I know You gave it all for me
And when all else fades, my soul will dance with You
Where the love lasts forever

And forever I will sing
Lord forever I will sing
Of how You gave Your life away
Just to save me, Lord You saved me

With You, where the love lasts forever



There is no height or depth
neither life nor death
That can take me from all that I find
Here now in Your glory Lord

No others powers or love
The things of now or to come
There's nothing on earth in this life
That could ever separate us Lord

Your love is never ending
To Your hands we surrender
Where all our sins are washed away
Your grace beyond reason
Has paid for our freedom
We're made alive in You

We run to Your throne
Where we belong
Every heart will sing
That Jesus is Lord
Casting all else aside
For the joy of our Christ
Let Your glory fall
Our hearts are filled with Your fire


Into your hands
I commit again With all I am, for you, lord
You hold my world
In the palm of your hand
And I am yours forever

Jesus I believe in you
Jesus I belong to you
You're the reason that I live
The reason that I sing
With all I am

I'll walk with you
Wherever you go
Through tears and joy
I'll trust in you
And I will live
In all of your ways
And your promises, forever

Jesus I believe in you
Jesus I belong to you
You're the reason that I live
The reason that I sing

Jesus I believe in you

Before the world
You knew the plans for me
Before my heart believed
You came to my rescue
And now I'm found in love
There's nowhere else to run
You keep my life within
Your mighty hand
Oh God

What could separate
From the love You give

Future of the world is within your hands of love
Love reaches me, I am in awe of you

As I pray, and wait upon the Lord
I know your grace and now I am restored

As I think of all you've done for me
A mystery of your love

Who walked upon the sea?
Who lived to die for me?

You, Lord

You Are Lord

As I look upon who I am changed
Though I Fail Your Faithful Love Remain

As I sing and worship you found again
No Words Describe Your Love

Who watches over me?

In the life we call surrender
Let the world I know
Be the glory of Your grace 

Sing, my soul, of the Savior's love

You've shown me life
You've opened my eyes
So I give You my praise

You've shown me life
You've opened my eyes
To the truth that there's no greater love

Now in the darkness God's light shines
Christ forever glorified
So come on come on sing out to God
Now with all we've got
We live for You our God

Salvation's strong in Christ alone
The Saviour King alone in victory
I step aside give You my life
For You to move do what You want to do

I can't imagine a life without You without You
'Cause it's all for You
Yeah it's all for You
God


On that day when I see
All that You have for me
When I see You face to face
There surrounded by Your grace

All my fears swept away
In the light of Your embrace
Where Your love is all I need
And forever I am free

Where the streets are made of gold
In Your presence healed and whole
May the songs of heaven rise to You alone

No weeping no hurt or pain no suffering
You hold me now, you hold me now
No darkness, no sick or lame no hiding
You hold me now, you hold me now

In this life I will stand
Through my joy and my pain
Knowing there's a greater day
There's a hope that never fades

When Your name is lifted high
And forever praises rise
For the glory of Your name
I'm believing for the day

When the wars and violence cease
All creation lives in peace
Let the songs of heaven rise to you alone

No weeping no hurt or pain no suffering
You hold me now, you hold me now
No darkness, no sick or lame no hiding
You hold me now, you hold me now

For eternity all my heart will give
All the glory to Your name

Chains be broken
Lives be healed
Eyes be opened
Christ is revealed

I have decided
I have resolved
To wait upon You Lord
My rock and Redeemer
Shield and reward
I'll wait upon You Lord

As surely as the sun will rise
You'll come to us
Certain as the dawn appears

You'll come
Let Your glory fall as You respond to us
Spirit rain
Flood into our thirsty hearts again
You'll come
You'll come

We are not shaken
We are not moved
We wait upon You Lord
Mighty deliverer
Triumph and truth
We wait upon You Lord

As surely as the sun will rise

Certain as Your word endures

You'll come
Let Your glory fall as You respond to us

Flood into our thirsty hearts again

You are the love of my life
And you are the reason I'm alive
And baby baby baby
When I think of how you saved me
I go crazy

I've never known love like this
And it fills me with a new tenderness
And I know I know I know
You're in my heart you're in my soul
You're all I can't resist

And I need to tell you
The first time I held you
I knew you are the love of my life

I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
'Til you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know
Is I need you

And you are the love of my life
All the joy and tears that I cry
And baby baby baby
You don't have to say a word
I see it in your eyes

As we stand together
I promise forever
'Til the day that I die
You are the love of my life

I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
'Til you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know
Is I need you

You are the love of my life
You are the reason I'm alive



You surrounded me with songs of praise
You have brought me to this place
Where Your love and grace move within my life
Now Your message is my light

Your love is beautiful
Your love is beautiful
It's the reason why I sing

All around the world
Let the praise begin
All around the world
Let the praise begin

I am planted here by the waters and
I'm living for the King
I have found my peace in the house of God
This is where I'm meant to be

Your love is beautiful
Your love is beautiful
It's the reason why I sing

All around the world
Let the praise begin
All around the world
Let the praise begin

All around the world
Let the praise begin
All around the world
Let the praise begin

 Your love is beautiful
Your love is beautiful
It's the reason why I sing

All around the world
Let the praise begin
All around the world
Let the praise begin

All around the world
Let the praise begin
All around the world
Let the praise begin


Your innocence forsaken
Upon that cross
You gave Yourself for us
Carried into Your freedom

Our broken past replaced in
A second chance
The chains have come undone
Death defied in the Father?s love


We are,
Living to make Your Name high
Jesus
Living to make Your Name high
Jesus You,
Gave what the world couldn?t offer us
Say what they want, Say what they want
We are free

The atmosphere is changing,
Oh can You hear
The people rising up
In the hope of Your freedom

Our former ways are breaking
We seek Your face,
God let Your kingdom come
In our praises be lifted up

With eyes on high we praise You
And with one voice we come together
Our one desire to praise You
And lift You up in our surrender

With eyes on high we praise You
And with one voice we come together
Our one desire to praise You
And lift You up ?cause we are


Your people sing praises
Let laughter fill the world
Your people sing praises
Let love and faith be heard

Jesus came to the rescue
And where the reason He came
To come on lift up a mighty voice
Till Jesus come again

We praise the Lord with our voices
We praise the Lord with our hearts
We praise the Lord with all our strength
And everything else that we've got

We praise His with dancing
We praise His with the drums
To come on lift up Jesus' Name
Till the day He comes



Yours is the Kingdom
And the power
And the glory forever is Yours
Heaven and earth bow down
In the wonder of Your Name
Heaven is open
Death is broken
And the glory forever is Yours
Nothing can overcome
The power of Your Name

King above kings
All the universe will sing
Everlasting God
You are wonderful
You are wonderful

And the shout of the earth
Will be Your praise
God forever
And the light unto all
Will be Your wonderful Name
For the glory Lord is Yours
God forever
All the glory Lord is Yours


Jesus
We worship you lord
We love you
We love you

The greatest love that anyone could ever know
That overcame the cross and grave to find my soul
And 'til I see You face to face and grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in You

With all I am I'll live to see Your kingdom come
And in my heart I pray You'd let Your will be done
And 'til I see You face to face and grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in You


I will live to love You
I will live to bring You praise
I will live a child in awe of You

You are the voice that calls the universe to be
You are the whisper in my heart that speaks to me
And 'til I see You face to face and grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in you




You alone are God of all
You alone are worthy Lord
And with all I am my soul will bless Your name




You alone are God of all
You alone are worthy Lord
And with all I am my soul will bless Your name


The skies lay low where You are
On the earth You rest Your feet
Yet the hands that cradle the stars
Are the hands that bled for me

In a moment of glorious surrender
You were broken for all the world to see
Lifted out of the ashes
I am found in the aftermath

Freedom found in Your scars
In Your grace my life redeemed
For You chose to take the sinner's crown
As You placed Your crown on me

In that moment of glorious surrender
Was the moment You broke the chains in me

Lifted out of the ashes
I am found in the aftermath
And in that moment You opened up the heavens
To the broken the beggar and the thief
Lifted out of the wreckage
I find hope in the aftermath

And I know that You're with me
Yes I know that You're with me here
And I know Your love will light the way

Now all I have I count it all as loss
But to know You and to carry the cross
Knowing I'm found
In the light of the aftermath


I don't care what they say about me
It's all right, all right
I don't care they think about me
It's all right, they'll get it one day


I love you, I'll follow you
You are my, my life
I will read my Bible and pray
I will follow you all day

I don't care what it costs anymore
Cause you gave it all and I'm following you
I don't care what it takes anymore
No matter what happens I'm going your way




All Day
All Day now
All Day
I'll follow You

I don't care what they say about me
It's all right, all right
I don't care they think about me
It's all right, they'll get it one day






Anyone around can see
just how good you've been to me
For all my friends that don't know you
I pray that you would save them too




All for love a Father gave.. For only love could make a way... All for love the heavens cried.. For love was crucified.

Oh, how many times have I broken your heart... But still you forgive if only I ask..
And how many times have you heard me pray..Draw near to me..

Everything I need is You
My beginning and forever
Everything I need is You

Let me sing all for love.. I will join the angel song. Ever Holy is the Lord, King of Glory, King of All.

All for love a Saviour prayer.. Abba Father have your way.. Though they know not what they do.. Let the cross draw man to you


Left my fear by the side of the road
Hear you speak
Won't let go
Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray

Got every reason to be here again
Father's love that draws me in
And all my eyes want to see is a glimpse of You

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord

All I need is You forever
All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord

One more day and it's not the same
Your spirit calls my heart to sing
Drawn to the voice of my Savior once again
Where would my soul be without your Son
Gave His life to save the earth
Rest in the thought that 
You're watching over me

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord
Is You Lord

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord

All I need is You you you
All I need is You

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord

All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord

All I need is You
You Jesus
You saves my soul
You make me fall
I'm new because of you

You hold the universe
You hold everyone on earth
You hold the universe
You hold
Yeah You hold

You hold the universe
You hold everyone on earth
You hold the universe
You hold

You hold the universe
You hold everyone on earth

All I need is You 
All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord


Did You rise the sun for me?
Or paint a million stars that I might
Know your majesty?
Is Your voice upon the wind?
Is everything I've known marked?
With my maker's fingerprints?

Breathe on me
Let me see Your face
Ever I will seek You


'Cause all You are, is all I want, always
Draw me close in Your arms
Oh God, I want to be with You

Can I feel You in the rain?
Abandon all I am to have You
Capture me again
Let the earth resound with praise
Can You hear as all creation lives
To glorify one name?


Take my life I lay it down
At the cross where I am found
All I have I give to You oh God

Take my hands and make them clean
Keep my heart in purity
That I may walk in all You have for me


Oh here I stand
Arms open wide
Oh I am Yours
And You are mine

Take my moments and my days
Let each breath that I take
Be ever only for You oh God



My whole life is Yours
I give it all
Surrendered to Your Name
And forever I will pray
Have Your way
Have Your way




In our hearts Lord
In this nation

Light to men
Love of God
Healing for the wounded heart
Like a child quiet my soul
Hear Your voice surround me Lord

Jesus, hold me into Your heart
Into Your heart
Lord my soul delights
And I know You hear my prayer
Take me deeper Lord

Glorious Son to You I shall bow
Bow my knee, bow my will
Cherished by the strong and the weak
Humble hearts shall hear You speak
And by Your love Lord You opened my heart
Now Your light will shine always
By Your Word Lord Your promise secure
And my soul will live always
Take me deeper Lord


This is my prayer in the desert
When all that's within me feels dry
This is my prayer and my hunger in me
My God is the God who provides

And this is my prayer in the fire
In weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved
Of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord through the flames

I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

And this is my prayer in my battle
When triumph is still on its way
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
So firm on His promise I'll stand

I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

And this is my prayer in the harvest
When favor and providence flow
I know I'm filled to be emptied again
This seed I've received I will sow


You crossed the great divide, You took our place
You offered up Your life though we have failed
The veil was torn and love remained
You are holy Lord

Distraction costs us how we seek Your face
We offer up our lives to bring You praise
A love the walls cannot contain
You are holy Lord

We're rising up in spirit and in truth
A living sacrifice we worship You
People undivided, Lord hear us sing
We are Yours and You are our King

This is our love
Hearts joined as one
Desperate for all You are
Lord break down these walls
And see how we love
Desperate for all You are
We chase Your heart

We didn't come to leave here entertained
Or worship under any other name
We're crying out for You alone
You are holy Lord

We're rising up in spirit and in truth
A living sacrifice we worship You
People undivided, Lord hear us sing
We are Yours and You are our King

This is our love
Hearts joined as one
Desperate for all You are
Lord break down these walls
And see how we love
Desperate for all You are
We chase Your heart

Show us the way to Your heart

We found our voice
We found our cause
Were on our knees, the carpet's worn
We join our hearts
With distant shores and sing to You Lord

This is our love
Hearts joined as one
Desperate for all You are
Lord break down these walls
And see how we love
Desperate for all You are

This is our love
Hearts joined as one
Desperate for all You are
Lord break down these walls
And see how we love
Desperate for all You are
We chase Your heart


I've been running, trying to be one who sees
I've been working, salvation out on my knees
There is nothing better than knowing
That we are redeemed
Unbelieving, trusting in creative hands
I am praying for our world to bow to your plan
And this one thought is unmistakable
I take up my cross and follow you Lord

When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow
When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

Unforgiven, my savior who did not deserve death
He was blameless and I was lost in shamefulness
Undelivered, but it doesn't seem right
Unless I keep my eyes focused on the savior who gave his live
In the middle of a world that denies it believes
It is breaking apart at the very seams
There is one thing to be alive for
And it's to take up my cross and follow you Lord

When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow
When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

And I fall to my knees

I will take up my cross and follow Lord where you lead me
And I will take up my cross and follow wherever you go
I will take up my cross and follow Lord where you lead me
And I will take up my cross and follow wherever you go


When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow
When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow
When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

And I fall to my knees
I fall to my knees
I fall to my knees


I found the place called an open heart
Where loves embrace mends a broken heart
Here I will stand for all my days

I found the place called an open heart
Where loves embrace mends a broken heart
Here I will stand for all my days

Drawing closer, drawing closer
Drawing closer, drawing closer


I found the place called an open heart
Where loves embrace mends a broken heart
Here I will stand for all my days

I found the place called an open heart
Where loves embrace mends a broken heart
Here I will stand for all my days

Drawing closer, drawing closer
Drawing closer, drawing closer

We come into Your presence
To sing a song to You
A song of praise and honor
For all the things You helped us through

You gave a life worth living
A life in love with You
And now I just love giving
All my praises back to You

You're the Father of creation
The risen Lamb of God
You're the One who walked away
From the empty tomb that day

And You set Your people free
With love and liberty
And I can walk with You
Every night and every day

You're the Father of creation
The risen Lamb of God
You're the One who walked away
From the empty tomb that day

And You set Your people free
With love and liberty
And I can walk with You
Every night and every day

We come into Your presence
To sing a song to You
A song of praise and honor
For all the things You helped us through

You gave a life worth living
A life in love with You
And now I just love giving
All my praises back to You

You're the Father of creation
The risen Lamb of God
You're the One who walked away
From the empty tomb that day

And You set Your people free
With love and liberty
And I can walk with You
Every night and every day

You're the Father of creation
The risen Lamb of God
You're the One who walked away
From the empty tomb that day

And You set Your people free
With love and liberty
And I can walk with You
Every night and every day

You're the Father of creation
The risen Lamb of God
You're the One who walked away
From the empty tomb that day

And You set Your people free
With love and liberty
And I can walk with You
Every night and every day


Cause I know that you're alive
You came to fix my broken life
And I'll sing to glorify
Your Holy name, Jesus Christ

You bought my life with the blood
That you shed on the cross
When you died for the sins of men
And you let out a cry, crucified
Now alive in me

These hands are yours
Teach them to serve 
As you please and I'll reach out
Desperate to see all the greatness of God
May my soul rest assured in you

I'll never be the same
No I'll never be the same
Cause I know that you're alive
You came to fix my broken life
And I'll sing to glorify
Your Holy name, Jesus Christ

You've changed it all
You broke down the wall
When I spoke and confessed
In you I am blessed
Now I walk in the light
In victorious sight of you

Fire fall down
Fire fall down
On us we pray
As we seek
Fire fall down
Your fire fall down
On us we pray

Show me your heart
Show me your way
Show me your glory


Since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses
Let us run, let us run with perseverance
The race marked out, let us make a way
For those who are to come, those who are to come
Every generation, every nation, every tribe, every tongue
They will sing, they will pray, that the world would sing,

Hosanna


I'll Worship at Your Throne
Whisper my own love song
With all my heart I'll sing
For You my Dad and King
I'll live for all my days
To Put a smile on Your face
And when we finally meet
It'll be for eternity

And Oh how wide You open up Your arms
When I need Your love
And how far You would come
If ever I was lost
And You said that all You feel for me
Is undying love
That You showed me through the cross


I'll worship You my God
I'll worship You my God
I love You
I love You
Forever I will sing
Forever I will be with You
Be with You

I'll Worship at Your Throne
Whisper my own love song
With all my heart I'll sing
For You my Dad and King
I'll live for all my days
To Put a smile on Your face
And when we finally meet
It'll be for eternity

And Oh how wide You open up Your arms
When I need Your love
And how far You would come
If ever I was lost
And You said that all You feel for me
Is undying love
That You showed me through the cross




Amazing love no other shall I need
Your name brings life more than the air I breathe

My world was changed when your life gave for me
My purpose found in all that you are for me

And I found myself in You
And I found myself in You

Amazing love no other shall I need
Your name brings life more than the air I breathe

And I found myself in You
And I found myself in You

And I found myself in You
And I found myself in You

Take me to the place where I can see you face to face
All I want to do
All I want to do is worship You
Take me to the place where I can see you face to face
All I want to do
All I want to do is worship You

Would you believe me if I said
That we are the ones who can make the change
In the world today
Would you believe me if I said
That all of your dreams in your heart
Can come true today
Would you believe me if I said
That life could be all that you want it to be today

And if I had wings I would fly
'Cause all that I need, You are
And if the world caved in around me
To You I'd still hold on
'Cause You're all that I believe
And the one that created me
Jesus because of You I'm free

Would you believe me if I said
That God can make miracles happen today
Would you believe me if I said
That you don't need to wait for the answers before
You step out in faith
Would you believe me if I said
That nothing is ever impossible for God

And if I had wings I would fly
'Cause all that I need, You are
And if the world caved in around me
To You I'd still hold on
'Cause You're all that I believe
And the one that created me
Jesus because of You I'm free

Just live your life with God inside
You wont regret one moment of it
And give all that you can for God, for God

And if I had wings I would fly
'Cause all that I need, You are
And if the world caved in around me
To You I'd still hold on
'Cause You're all that I believe
And the one that created me
Jesus because of You

And if I had wings I would fly
'Cause all that I need, You are
And if the world caved in around me
To You I'd still hold on
'Cause You're all that I believe
And the one that created me
Jesus because of You I'm free

And You made us right again

You came from God above
The Father's only Son

Still Your mercy remains
And should I stumble again
I'm caught in Your grace

The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise

We're giving it all away, away
Giving it all to go Your way
We're giving it all away, away
Giving it all to go Your way

In the Father there is freedom
There is hope in the name that is Jesus
Lay Your life down, give it all now
We are found in the love of the Savior

We've come alive in You
Set free to show the truth
Our lives will never be the same

We're giving it all away, away
Giving it all to go Your way

We are sold out to Your calling
Everything that we are for Your glory
Take our hearts now, have it all now
Let our lives shine the light like the morning

Set free to show the truth
Our lives will never be the same

We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way
Giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way

Roll back the curtains from our eyes
And now we can see You
Shown us Your way, Your truth and life
We offer our lives to bring You fame
We're caught in Your freedom
We're caught in Your freedom

Giving it all away, away
Giving it all to go Your way
Giving it all away, away
Giving it all to go Your way

Savior I come
Quiet my soul, remember
Redemption's hill
Where Your blood was spilled
For my ransom

Everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost

Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me, lead me to the cross

You were as I
Tempted and trialed
Human
The word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now you're risen

Everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost

Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me, lead me to the cross

To your heart
To your heart
Lead me to your heart
Lead me to your heart

Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me, lead me to the cross


Jesus would You light my way
Jesus would You light my way

In every word, in every scene
To live for the one who died for me
What grace is this that saved my soul
My God, my God, I give it all

All I ever want is
All I ever need is You


Beautiful God
Laying Your majesty aside
You reached out in love to show me life
Lifted from darkness into light
Oh

King for a slave
Trading Your righteousness for shame
Despite all my pride and foolish ways
Caught in Your infinite embrace
Oh

And I find myself here on my knees again
Caught up in grace like an avalanche
Nothing compares to this love love love
Burning in my heart

Saviour and Friend
Breathing Your life into my heart
Your word is the lamp unto my path
Forever I'm humbled by Your love
Oh

Take my life
Take all that I am
With all that I am I will love You
Take my heart
Take all that I have
Jesus how I adore You

And I find myself here on my knees again
Caught up in grace like an avalanche
Nothing compare to this love love love


I know You love
me I know You died for me
I know You care
I know You care

I know You live again
Your life for all my sin
Now I stand here in
In Your grace again

As I look into the sky above
Wonder how my life has changed
Wonder how Your love, it came to me
As I look into the sky above
All my fears, so far away
All I hear is heaven calling me

So I look to You
So I look to You
No one else will do
No one else will do


Beholding Your beauty
Is all that I long for
To worship You Jesus
Is my sole desire
For this very heart
You have shaped for Your pleasure
Purposed to lift Your name higher

Here in surrender
In pure adoration
I enter Your courts
With an offering of praise
I am Your servant
Come to bring You glory
As is fit for the work of Your hands

Now unto the Lamb
Who sits on the throne
Be glory and honor and praise
All of creation resounds with the song
Worship and praise Him the Lord of Lords

Spirit now living
And dwelling within me
Keep my eyes fixed
Ever on Jesus' face
Let not the things
Of this world ever sway me
I'll run till I finish the race


Unto the Lamb
Who sits on the throne
Be glory and honor and praise
All of creation resounds with the song
Worship and praise the Lord

Now unto the Lamb
Who sits on the throne
Be glory and honour and praise
All of eternity echoes the song
Worship and praise Him the Lord of Lords

Holy Lord
You are holy
Jesus Christ is the Lord 

Now unto the Lamb
Who sits on the throne
Be glory and honor and praise
Call all the sinners to join in the song
Worship and praise Him the Lord of Lords

Lord of lords 


Your love's enough to see the broken hearts
Gain a brand new start with a brand new heart
As the faithful hope in things unseen
You're enough to see all the things they dream
Come to life

Were living in the Saviour today
And this day is what we have now
In this moment we have chosen to praise
And it's changing how we live now

Your love it broke my fall
It's more than enough and I need it
Cause I've never known better
And I'll never know better

This love will see me soar
It's more than enough and I need it
Cause I've never known better
And I'll never know better

Your love's enough to see the humbled man
Find the cause of Christ
With his outstretched hands
As the cripple grabs his mat to walk
You're enough to save him from the pain he bore

My Saviour
You'll never let me go
My life is now secure

My Saviour
You'll never let me go
And in Your hands my future's brighter

A love that's never failing, let mercy fall on me
Well, everyone needs forgiveness
The kindness of a Saviour, the hope of nations

Saviour, He can move the mountains
For my God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save
Forever, author of Salvation
Where He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave

So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures, fill my life again

And all I know


I love You more than life
I love You more than life

Fall back on everything You've done
Fall back on everlasting arms
When all the world is swept away
You are all the things I need
You're the air I breathe



How can it be
You were the one on the cross
Lifted for all our shame?
How can it be
The scars in Your hands are for me?
You are the king of all




You hold the future in your hands
You know my dreams and you have a plan
And as you light my way, I'll follow you

My eyes on all of the above
My soul secure in all you've done
My minds made up
And you are the only one for me

Jesus, savior, in my life you are everything
My future decided, I will praise your name
And I know that I am, I am yours

My soul secure in all you've done
My minds made up
And you are the only one for me

In the shadows my spirit weak
Love broke the darkness and lifted me
And I know you'll never let me go

In the storm in the raging sea
Love conquered the fear and delivered me
And I know you'll never let me go

Oh love in the shadows
Be the light who leads me on
You're love I will follow
Be my guide, you're will be done
Oh Lord

In the arms of the one unseen
Love carried the cross that was meant for me
And I know you'll never let me go

Oh love in the shadows
Be the light who leads me on
You're love I will follow
Be my guide, you're will be done
Oh Lord

Oh love I surrender, now forever I'll be loved
In the love of the Father, you are faithful you are strong
So hold me now, hold me now, hold me now

Nothing in this life has walked these streets
Love opened my eyes show me what you see
And I know I'll never let you go


We've got nothing to lose
We've got no reason to hide
We've got the answer inside of us
It's time we took the disguises off
Well see Your glory revealed
And see Your Name lifted high
There is nobody else for us
Jesus You are the only One

You're alive and we are free
You are everything
Everything we need

There's not a minute to waste
Not a second to lose
There's a city that waits for us
It's time we took all the lamp shades off
Well see Your glory revealed
And see Your Name lifted high
There is nobody else for us
Jesus You are the only One

Love has spoken and we believe
You are everything
Everything we need

Nothing compares to You
Nothing could ever separate us now
Your love is ours
Nothing compares to You
Nothing could ever separate us
From this love

Nothing can separate us
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can separate us now


In the quiet, in the stillness
I know that You are God
In the secret of Your presence
I know there I am restored

When You call I won't refuse
Each new day again I'll choose

There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise

In the chaos, in confusion
I know You're sovereign still
In the moment of my weakness
You give me grace to do Your will

When You call I won't delay
This my song through all my days

All my delight is in You Lord
All of my hope, all of my strength
All my delight is in You Lord forever more


What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Come to us, Lord
You reward those who earnestly, diligently seek You
I wanna see Your face, I wanna know Your way
Come to us, Lord

We want You more than this life
More than our way Your way is higher
Your thoughts are higher
We surrender here tonight

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus


You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep
My faith will stand

And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and You won't start now

So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

On your cross, on your goodness, on your salvation Lord
There's nothing greater for all
That's why we worship you Lord!
Ooh, Lord!

Oh you bring hope to the hopeless
And light to those in the darkness
And death to life now I'm alive
Oh you give peace to the restless
And joy to homes that are broken
I see you now, in you I'm found

And you opened the door for me
And you laid down
Your life to set me free
All that I am will serve you Lord

Oh you fill those who are empty
And rescue those in the valley
And through it all you calm my soul
Oh now, you find me in my weakness
And heal the wounds of my heartache
I worship you in spirit and truth

And you opened the door for me

Your life to set me free
All that I am will serve you Lord, you Lord

The tide is turning
This is redemptions' hour
In the midst of a world lost for love
You are all we have now
The lost returning
Salvation is all around
In the midst of the world broken down
You are all we have now
For You are God and this hope is ours

So Father open the skies
Flood the earth with Your light
This is love
To break the world indifferent

Our hearts are burning
A fire that won't burn out
In the midst of a world that's grown cold
You are all we have now
The earth resounding
The anthem of your renown
As we lift up our eyes
And look to Your glory

Call us out
Let the world see
You are God
And this hope is ours
So call us out
Let the world see
You are God, as we sing

Father open the skies
Flood the earth with Your light
This is love
To break the world indifferent
As we lift up our eyes
Fill our hearts with Your fire
In a world of sin
We'll be different, the difference
So call us out
Let the world see
You are God, and this hope is ours

Our eyes are open
Every chain now broken
In this world
We are different
Let Your love become us
As we live to make You famous
In this world
We are different
So call us out
Let the world see
You are God, as we sing

Father open the skies
Flood the earth with Your light
This is love
To break the world indifferent
As we lift up our eyes
Fill our hearts with Your fire
In a world of sin
We'll be different, the difference
So call us out
Let the world see
You are God, One and only
In this world
You are all we have now


Your faithfullness endures always
Where mountains fall and reason fails
And You calm the raging seas
And You calm the storms in me, again

All I know is I find rest in You
All I know is I find rest in You

My heart will praise throughout the night
Where singing seems a sacrifice
Your grace is all I need
Your grace is all I need


My life is a light for Your cause
My will laid aside for Your call
And reserved are the depths of my heart
Only for You

I'm caught in the rhythms of grace
They overcome all of my ways
Realigning each step everyday
To live for Your glory

There's none beside You God
There's none beside You God

You're there in the dark of the night
While holding the sun and it's light
Through the triumph and trials alike
There's no-one beside You

Your voice called the stars by their name
'Cause You whispered them all to their place
To testify to Your wonder and praise
Both now and forever

There's none beside You God
There's none beside You God
I love my life to shine Your light
'Cause there's none beside You God

No eye has seen
No ear has heard
The depths of Your love, Lord
No mind can fathom
The love You deserve
How great You are


God above all the world in motion
God above all my hopes and fears
And I don't care what the world throws at me now
I'm gonna be alright

Hear the sounds of the generations
Making loud our freedom song
All in all that the world would know Your name
It's gonna be alright

Cause I know my God saved the day
And I know His word never fails
And I know my God made a way for me
Salvation is here

Salvation is here
Salvation is here and He lives in me
Salvation is here
Salvation that died just to set me free
Salvation is here
Salvation is here and He lives in me
Salvation is here
Cause You are alive and You live in me


And now the weak say I have strength
By the spirit of power that raised Christ from the dead
And now the poor stand and confess
That my portion is you and I'm more than blessed

Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our king

We love you Lord, we worship you
You are our God, you alone are good

Let now your church shine as your bride
That you soar in your heart as you offered up your life
Let now the lost be welcomed home
By the saved and redeemed those adopted as your own

Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our king

We love you Lord, we worship you
You are our God, you alone are good
You asked your Son to carry this
The heavy cross, our weight of sin

I love you Lord, I worship you
Hope which was lost, now stands renewed
I give my life to honor this
The love of Christ, the savior king

Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our king, for you we sing 

(We love you Lord, we worship you
You are our God, you alone are good)

You asked your Son to carry this
The heavy cross, our weight of sin

I love you Lord, I worship you
Hope which was lost, now stands renewed

It used to be darkness
Without you I
I lived my life in blindness
But now I am found

And I'll sing, sing I love you so
And I'll sing
Because the world can't take away
Your love

Found me in weakness
Broken
You came to me in kindness
And now I live

I'll give my life for you Lord
For all you've done


It is not a human right
To stand afar while broken nations dream
Open up our eyes, so blind
That we might find the mercy for the need

Hey now
Fill our hearts with your compassion
Hey now
As we hold to our confession

It is not too far a cry
Too much to try to help the least of these
Politicians should not decide if we should rise
And be your hands and feet

Singing
Hey now
Fill our hearts with your compassion
Hey now
As we hold to our confession

Whoa-oo-oh
God, be their solution
Whoa-oo-oh
We will be your hands and be your feet

Yeah yeah

Higher than our circumstance
You promise and your love for all to see
Higher than our protest lines and dollar signs
Your love is all we need

Hey now
Fill our hearts with your compassion
Hey now
As we hold to our confession

Whoa-oo-oh
God, be their solution
Whoa-oo-oh
We will be your hands and be your feet

Whoa-oo-oh
God, be their solution
Whoa-oo-oh
We will be your hands and be your feet

Whoa yeah

Only you can mend the broken heart
And cause the blind to see
You erase complete the sinner's past
And set the captives free

Only you can take the widow's cry
And cause the heart to see
Be the Father to the fatherless
Our Savior and our King

We will be your hands
We will be your feet
We run this race for the least of these
In the darkest place we will be your light
We will be your light

We will be your hands
We will be your feet
We run this race for the least of these
In the darkest place we will be your light
We will be your light

Whoa-oo-oh
God, be their solution
Whoa-oo-oh
We will be your hands and be your feet

Whoa-oo-oh
God, be their solution
Whoa-oo-oh
We will be your hands and be your feet

We will
We will
God be the solution

We will
We will
God be the solution

We will be your hands
We will be your feet
We run this race for the least of these
In the darkest place we will be your light
We will be your light


Soon and very soon
My King is coming
Robed in righteousness
And crowned with love
When I see Him
I shall be made like Him
Soon and very soon

Soon and very soon I'll be going
To the place He has prepared for me
There my sin erased
My shame forgotten
Soon and very soon


I will be with the One I love
With unveiled face I'll see Him
There my soul will be satisfied
Soon and very soon

Soon and very soon
See the procession
The angels and the elders
'Round the throne
At His feet I'll lay my crowns
My worship
Soon and very soon

Though I have not seen Him
My heart knows Him well
Jesus Christ the Lamb
The Lord of heaven

Following the shining light
In Your hands
The power to save the world
My life

Tear down the walls see the world 
Is there something we have missed
Turn from ourselves, look beyond 
There's so much more than this

And I don't need to see it to believe it
I don't need to see it to believe it
'Cause I can't shake 
This fire burning deep inside my heart

Look to the skies, hope arise 
See His majesty revealed
More than this life there is love 
There is hope and this is real

And I don't need to see it to believe it
I don't need to see it to believe it
'Cause I can't shake 
This fire burning deep inside my heart

This life is Yours and hope is rising 
As Your glory floods our hearts
Let love tear down these walls 
That all creation would 
Come back to You
It's all for You

Who are walking in the darkness
You are calling us to lead them back to You
We will see Your spirit rising 
As the lost come out of hiding
Every heart will see this hope we have in You

And I don't need to see it to believe it
I don't need to see it to believe it
'Cause I can't shake 
This fire burning deep inside my heart, yeah

This life is Yours and hope is rising 
As Your glory floods our hearts
Let love tear down these walls

You stood before creation
Eternity within Your hands
You spoke all life into motion
My soul now to stand

You stood before my failure
And carried the cross for my shame
My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
My soul now to stand

So what can I say
And what could I do
But offer this heart O God
Completely to You

So I'll walk upon salvation
Your Spirit alive in me
This life to declare Your promise
My soul now to stand

So what can I say
And what could I do
But offer this heart O God
Completely to You

So what can I say
And what could I do
But offer this heart O God
Completely to You

So I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the One who gave it all
I'll stand
My soul Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours

Bound to me with love
Adopted in free from all sin

Jesus Saviour glorified

I stand before You humbled and in awe

And all
To You God
For all You are to me

There is nothing like
There is nothing like
Your Love.. Your Love 

Holy Spirit gift of God 
Teach my soul to soar 
Train me in Your Holy ways oh Lord 



I love you forever 
I love you forever 
I love you forever Lord


Jesus
We worship you lord
We love you
We love you

The greatest love that anyone could ever know
That overcame the cross and grave to find my soul
And 'til I see You face to face and grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in You

With all I am I'll live to see Your kingdom come
And in my heart I pray You'd let Your will be done
And 'til I see You face to face and grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in You


I will live to love You
I will live to bring You praise
I will live a child in awe of You

You are the voice that calls the universe to be
You are the whisper in my heart that speaks to me
And 'til I see You face to face and grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in you




You alone are God of all
You alone are worthy Lord
And with all I am my soul will bless Your name

And with all I am my soul will bless Your name


The precious blood of Jesus Christ redeems
Forgiven I'm alive restored set free
Your majesty resides inside of me
Forever I believe
Forever I believe
Arrested by Your truth and righteousness
Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness
Convicted by Your spirit led by Your word
Your love will never fail
Your love will never fail


I know You gave
The word Your only Son for us
To know Your name
To live within the Saviour's love
He took my place
Knowing He'd be crucified
And You loved
You loved a people undeserving

Arrested by Your truth and righteousness
Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness
Convicted by Your spirit led by Your word
Your love will never fail
Your love will never fail




Love unfailing
Overtaking my heart
You take me in
Finding peace again
Fear is lost in all you are

And I would give the world to tell you're story 
'Cause I know that you've called me
I know that you've called me
I've lost myself for good within your promise
And I won't hide it
I won't hide it 

Jesus, I believe in You
And I would go, to the ends of the earth
To the ends of the earth
For you alone are the son of God
And all the world will see
That You are God
You are God


With all I'm holding inside
With all hopes and desires
And all the dreams that I've dreamt
With all I'm hoping to be
And all that the world will bring
And all that fails to compare.

You say You want all for me
I wouldn't have it any other way.

I've got a Saviour and He's living in me
WHOA.

I wana know
I wana know You today.

And You're the best thing that has happened to me
And the world will never take
The world will never take You away
No-one could ever take You away.


Your mercy found me,
Upon the broken road,
And lifted me beyond my failing,
Into Your glory,
My sin and shame dissolved,
And now forever Yours I'll stand.


In love never to end,
To call You more than Lord,
Glorious friend.


So I throw my life upon all You are,
'Cause I know You gave it all for me,
And when all else fades,
My soul will dance with You,
Where the love lasts forever.

Your mercy found me,
Upon the broken road,
And lifted me beyond my failing,
Into Your glory,
My sin and shame dissolved,
And now forever Yours I'll stand.






And forever I will sing,
Lord forever I will sing,
Of how You gave Your life away,
Just to save me, Lord You saved me.




With You, where the love lasts forever.


Have you ever seen the wonder
In the glimmer of first sight
As the eyes begin to open
And the blindness meets the light
If you have so say

I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living color
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light

Have you ever seen the wonder
In the air of second life
Having come out of the waters
With the old one left behind
If you have so say

I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living color
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light

I see the world in grace
I see the world in gospel
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light
I'm walking in the wonder
You're the wonder in the wild
Turning wilderness to wonder

If You have so say
I see the world in love
I see the world in freedom
I see the Jesus way
You're the wonder in the wild

I see the world Your way
And I'm not afraid to follow
I see the world Your way
And I'm not ashamed to say so
I see the Jesus way
And I'm walking in the light

I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living color
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light

Ooh, I say, I see the world in grace
I see the world in gospel
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light
I'm walking in the wonder
You're the wonder in the wild
Wilderness to wonder

Well, I say, I see the world in love
I see the world in freedom
I see the Jesus way
You're the wonder in the wild


As I pray and wait upon the Lord
I know your grace and love I am restored
As I think of all you've done for me
The mystery of your love

Who walked upon the sea
Who lived to die for me
You Lord, You Lord
You Lord, Lord

As I look upon you I am changed
And though I fail, your faithful love remains
As I sing and worship you
I find again no words describe your love

Who watches over me
Who love has covered me
You Lord, You Lord
You Lord, Lord

Hallelujah, hallelujah almighty one
There is none like you
Hallelujah, hallelujah almighty one
There is none like you
Hallelujah, hallelujah almighty one
There is none like you
Hallelujah, hallelujah almighty one
There is none like you

There is none like you


On that day when I see
All that You have for me
When I see You face to face
There surrounded by Your grace

All my fears swept away
In the light of Your embrace
Where Your love is all I need
And forever I am free

Where the streets are made of gold
In Your presence healed and whole
May the songs of heaven rise to You alone

No weeping no hurt or pain no suffering
You hold me now, you hold me now
No darkness, no sick or lame no hiding
You hold me now, you hold me now

In this life I will stand
Through my joy and my pain
Knowing there's a greater day
There's a hope that never fades

When Your name is lifted high
And forever praises rise
For the glory of Your name
I'm believing for the day

When the wars and violence cease
All creation lives in peace
Let the songs of heaven rise to you alone

No weeping no hurt or pain no suffering
You hold me now, you hold me now
No darkness, no sick or lame no hiding
You hold me now, you hold me now

For eternity all my heart will give
All the glory to Your name


What could stand before You as You chose to embrace a cross no one deserved
You took for me the weight of sin upon You when You offered Your life
As You walked the streets of men with fading strength

How could we live but not see Your sacrifice, Your glory?

You reign, You reign, over everything Lord You reign
With power and justice divine
Over everything Lord You reign

What was Your last thought as You drew Your last breath
Where the victory was Yours for us to see
And all will know the Truth as we live and brace every praise through You
Oh, Lord

How could we live but not see Your sacrifice, Your glory?

You reign, You reign, over everything Lord You reign
With power and justice divine
Over everything Lord You reign

See now the King of glory
Love of God become my calling
Father I surrender all I am to You forever

You reign, You reign, over everything Lord You reign
With power and justice divine
Over everything Lord You reign


I have decided, I have resolved
To wait upon You Lord
My rock and redeemer, shield and reward
I'll wait upon You Lord

Surely, as surely as the sun will rise
You'll come to us
Certain as the dawn appears

You'll come
Let Your glory fall as You respond to us
Spirit rain, flood into our thirsty hearts again
You'll come, you'll come

We are not shaken, we are not moved
We wait upon You Lord
Mighty deliverer, our triumph and truth
We wait upon You Lord

As surely as the sun will rise
You'll come to us
Certain as Your word endures

You'll come
Let Your glory fall as You respond to us
Spirit rain, flood into our thirsty hearts again
You'll come, you'll come

Chains be broken
Lives be healed
Eyes be opened
Christ is revealed

Chains be broken
Lives be healed
Eyes be opened
Christ is revealed

You'll come
Let Your glory fall as You respond to us
Spirit rain, flood into our thirsty hearts again
You'll come

You'll come
Let Your glory fall as You respond to us
Spirit rain, flood into my thirsty heart again
You'll come, you'll come


Your innocence forsaken
Upon that cross
You gave yourself for us
Carried into your freedom

Our broken past replaced in
A second chance
The chains have come undone
Death defied in the father's love


We are,
Living to make your name high
Jesus
Living to make your name high
Jesus you,
Gave what the world couldn't offer us
Say what they want, say what they want
We are free

The atmosphere is changing,
Oh can you hear
The people rising up
In the hope of your freedom

Our former ways are breaking
We seek your face,
God let your kingdom come
In our praises be lifted up


With eyes on high we praise you
And with one voice we come together
Our one desire to praise you
And lift you up in our surrender

With eyes on high we praise you
And with one voice we come together
Our one desire to praise you
And lift you up 'cause we are


Say His Name within the darkest hour 
And see His light illuminate our path 
The road is narrow but our gaze is set 
On the love of Christ 'til the very end 

We walk in the truth that overcame our sin 
Leaving our past and how we once had lived 
Giving our lives to see 
Your Name made known 
'Cause the love of Christ is what the world 
Needs most 

So Lord 
Lead us in the ways of Your love 
To lead a broken world to Your cross 
Lead us in the ways of Your love 

We are Yours forever 
Our lives won't be the same 
Yours forever our eyes won't turn away 
Yours forever 

We sing Your praises 'til our lungs give out 
To the hope of the world 
The One who gave us life 
Giving our lives to see 
Your Name made known 
'Cause the love of Christ is 
What the world needs most 

We are Yours forever 
Our lives won't be the same 
Yours forever our eyes won't turn away 
Yours forever our lives won't be the same 
Yours forever our eyes won't turn away 

We're living in the One who gave 
His life to see our sin erased 
We know 
We know 
Our hope is never gonna fade away
