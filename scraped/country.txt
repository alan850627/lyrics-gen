 It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
 And make fun of our exes, uh uh uh uh
 It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
 To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
 Yeah
 We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
 It's miserable and magical oh yeah
 Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time uh oh
 
 I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
 Everything will be alright, if you keep me next to you
 You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
 Everything will be alright, if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22
 
 It seems like one of those nights
 This place is too crowded, too many cool kids uh uh, uh uh
 It seems like one of those nights
 We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping
 Yeah
 We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
 It's miserable and magical oh yeah
 Tonight's the night, when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time uh oh
 
 I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
 Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
 You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
 Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22 uh uh ah ah ah 22 uh uh uh
 
 I don't know about you, 22 uh uh 22 uh uh
 
 It feels like one of those nights
 We ditch the whole scene
 It feels like one of those nights
 We won't be sleeping
 It feels like one of those nights
 You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have you ohh, uh, yeah
 
 I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
 Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
 You don't know about me but I bet you want to
 Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22 uh uh, 22 uh uoh,
 
 22 uh uh, yeah, 22 uh uhoo, yeah yeah
 
 It feels like one of those nights uh uh
 We ditch the whole scene
 It feels like one of those nights uh uh
 We won't be sleeping
 It feels like one of those nights uh uh
 You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have you
 
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
 Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
 Why would you wanna make the very first scar
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
 
 Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall
 And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
 No matter what you say I still can't believe
 That you would walk away
 It don't make sense to me but
 
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
 Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
 Why would you wanna make the very first scar
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
 
 It's not unbroken anymore
 How do I get it back the way it was before
 
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
 Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
 Why would you wanna make the very first scar
 Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a
 
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
 Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
 Why would you wanna make the very first scar
 Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
 
 I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
 'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
 Don't know what's down this road
 I'm just walking
 Trying to see through the rain coming down
 Even though I'm not the only one, who feels
 The way I do
 
 I'm alone, on my own
 And that's all I know,
 I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
 Oh, but life goes on
 Oh, I'm just a girl
 Trying to find a place in this world
 
 Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
 And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
 Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
 Could you tell me what more do I need?
 And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
 But that's okay
 
 I'm alone, on my own
 And that's all I know,
 I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
 Oh, but life goes on
 Oh, I'm just a girl
 Trying to find a place in this world
 
 Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
 But I'm ready to fly
 
 I'm alone, on my own
 And that's all I know
 Oh, I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
 Oh, but life goes on
 Oh, I'm alone, on my own
 And that's all I know
 Oh, I'm just a girl
 Trying to find a place in this world
 
 Oh, I'm just a girl
 Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
 Oh, I'm just a girl
 
 The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
 There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
 The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
 There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.
 
 Once I thought that love was something that I could never do
 Never knew that I could feel this much
 But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
 Is more than a reaction to your touch
 It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough!
 
 The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
 There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
 The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
 There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.
 
 Woah, oh, oh, oh...
 
 In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
 That never knocked me off my feet
 All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
 And baby it's no mystery why I surrender
 Boy you got everything.
 
 The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
 There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
 The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
 There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.
 
 I love your attitude, all your tattoos, your every thought
 Your smile. your lips, and boy the list goes on and on and on!
 
  the way you love with all you have
 There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me
 The way you kiss, the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
 There ain't nothing about you that don't do something for me.
 
 The way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
 Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
 Now I think you see there ain't nothing about you
 That don't do something for me.
 
 I wake up, I stretch out
 I wonder what you're doing right now
 Yeah, I slept in my makeup again
 Tell myself I must be crazy,
 Thinking about him
 
 I find myself something decent to wear
 Take the towel out of my hair
 About that time, you call me
 And I'm reminded, without you I'd be
 
 A stranger in an all night diner
 Waiting for her love to find her
 Lonely like a harbor line
 Thats never seen a boat
 Just like a line in an old love letter
 No one wrote
 
 I go to work, work all day
 I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say
 Walk to my car, dig out my keys
 Start thinking if you were with anyone but me
 
 A stranger in an all night diner
 Waiting for her love to find her
 Lonely like a harbor line
 That's never seen a boat
 Just like a line in an old love letter
 No one wrote
 
 There you are, on the street
 Standing there all waiting on me
 Yeah, I show you, my new shoes
 You say you love em, and baby without you,
 I'd be
 
 A stranger in an all night diner
 Waiting for her love to find her
 Lonely like a harbor line
 Thats never seen a boat
 Just like a line in an old love letter
 No one wrote
 
 I wake up, I stretch out
 Wonder what you're doing right now
 
 I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
 But something about it felt like home somehow
 And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
 And you still got it in your drawer, even now
 
 Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze
 We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
 Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
 And I can picture it after all these days
 
 And I know it's long gone
 And that magic's not here no more
 And I might be okay
 But I'm not fine at all
 
 'Cause there we are again, on that little town street
 You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
 Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well
 
 Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
 You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed
 Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
 You tell me about your past, thinking your future was me
 
 And I know it's long gone
 And there's nothing else I could do
 And I forget about you long enough
 To forget why I needed to
 
 'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night
 We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
 Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well
 
 And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
 But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
 Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
 
 And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
 So casually cruel in the name of being honest
 I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
 'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well
 
 Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
 I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
 After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
 Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
 
 But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
 You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah
 
 'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
 Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
 It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
 
 Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
 Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
 It was rare, I was there, I remember it all to well
 
 People like you always want back the love they gave away
 And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
 The more I think about it now the less I know
 All I know is that you drove us off the road
 
 Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Stay, hey, now you say you want it
 Back now that it's just too late
 Well could've been easy
 All you had to do was stay
 
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 
 Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
 I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
 People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
 But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye
 
 Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Stay, hey, now you say you want it
 Back now that it's just too late
 Well could've been easy
 All you had to do was stay
 
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay 
 
 Let me remind you this was what you wanted 
 You ended it
 You were all I wanted 
 But not like this
 Not like this
 Not like this
 Oh, all you had to do was stay
 
 Hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Stay, hey, now you say you want it
 Back now that it's just too late
 Well could've been easy
 All you had to do was stay
 
 Hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Stay, hey, now you say you want it
 Back now that it's just too late
 Well could've been easy 
 All you had to do was stay
 
 All you had to do was stay 
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay 
 
 
 Sometimes I wonder 
 How it's going to feel 
 Will my first love be true and real?
 Will I be ready when 
 My heart starts to fall?
 What will I do when my love comes to call? 
 
 And my daddy tells me 
 That I light up his world 
 Every day he says, "Darling 
 You're my best girl" 
 He tried to teach me 
 From the very start 
 The meaning of love 
 So nobody breaks my heart 
 
 Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
 Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
 Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
 Am I ready for the joy? 
 Am I ready for the pain? 
 Am I ready for the boy? 
 Am I ready for love? 
 For love 
 
 I know I'm not a little 
 Girl anymore 
 Because I'm feeling things 
 I've never felt before 
 Sweet sensations 
 And anticipations 
 Calling commotion 
 To my emotions 
 
 And I hear the words 
 My daddy says to me 
 He said, "Be true to yourself 
 And keep your spirit free 
 And love will find you 
 
 One way or another 
 Be good to yourself 
 And be good to each other" 
 
 Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
 Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
 Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
 Am I ready for the joy? 
 Am I ready for the pain? 
 Am I ready for the joy? 
 Am I ready for the pain? 
 Am I ready for love? 
 
 It's a run around the world 
 And it's moving so fast 
 Though I want to find 
 A love that's going to last 
 A love so strong 
 That it can withstand 
 The weight of the world 
 In the palm of its hand 
 
 Will my love come in a bowl of fire? 
 Will it be filled with hope and desire? 
 Will my love come in the pouring rain? 
 Am I ready for the joy? 
 Am I ready for the pain? 
 Am I ready for the joy? 
 Am I ready for the pain? 
 Am I ready for this game? 
 Am I ready for the kiss? 
 Am I ready for the stars? 
 Am I ready for the bliss? 
 Am I ready for love?
 
 American boy, living life as it goes
 Sitting on the fence posts
 Living in the light
 American boy, living in the real world
 Trying just to get the girl
 Trying to survive
 
 The simple things in life are always new
 Growing up on Sam Hill Avenue
 Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
 The greatest living hero that ever was
 Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
 The hope of an American boy
 
 Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
 Looking for the love
 Suddenly rise, an American beauty
 Suddenly he cheats, sent from above
 
 The simple things in life are always new
 Growing up on Sam Hill Avenue
 Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
 The greatest living hero that ever was
 Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
 The dream of an American boy
 
 American boy, raising little babies
 Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
 Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
 That's grown up, American boy
 
 The simple things in life are always new
 Growing up on Grandview Avenue
 Mama makes her cookies, and daddy's just
 The greatest living hero that ever was
 Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
 No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
 The hope of an American boy
 
 Well she was an American girl
 Raised on promises
 She couldnt help thinking that there
 Was a little more to life
 Somewhere else
 After all it was a great big world
 With lots of places to run to
 Yeah, and if she had to die
 Trying she had one little promise
 She was going to keep
 
 Oh yeah, all right
 Take it easy, baby
 Make it last all night
 She was an American girl
 
 It was kind of cold that night
 She stood alone on her balcony
 She could see the cars roll by
 Out on 441
 Like waves crashing in the beach
 And for one desperate moment there
 He crept back in her memory
 God, it's so painful
 Something that's so close
 And still so far out of reach
 
 Oh yeah, all right
 Take it easy, baby
 Make it last all night
 She was an American girl
 
 I like the way you wanted me
 Every night for so long baby
 I like the way you needed me
 Every time things got rocky
 
 I was believing in you
 Was I mistaken do you mean
 Do you mean what you say
 When you say our love could last forever
 
 But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
 I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
 I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
 But baby don't you break my heart slow
 
 I like the way you'd hold me
 Every night for so long baby
 I like the way you'd sing to me
 Every time things got rocky
 
 I was believing in you
 Was I mistaken do you say
 Do you say what you mean
 When you say our love could last forever
 
 Cause I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
 I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
 I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
 But baby don't you break my heart slow
 
 You would run around and lead me on forever
 While I stay at home still thinking we're together
 I wanted our love to last forever
 
 But I'd rather you be mean than love and lie
 I'd rather hear the truth and have to say goodbye
 I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know
 But baby don't you break my heart slow
 Baby don't you break my heart slow
 
 I'm so glad you made time to see me
 How's life, tell me how's your family?
 I haven't seen them in a while
 You've been good, busier then ever
 We small talk, work and the weather
 Your guard is up and I know why
 
 Because the last time you saw me
 Is still burned in the back of your mind
 You gave me roses and I left them there to die
 
 So this is me swallowing my pride
 Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
 And I go back to December all the time
 It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
 Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
 I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
 I go back to December all the time
 
 These days I haven't been sleeping
 Staying up playing back myself leaving
 When your birthday passed and I didn't call
 And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
 I watched you laughing from the passenger side
 And realized I'd loved you in the fall
 And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
 You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
 
 So this is me swallowing my pride
 Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
 And I go back to December all the time
 It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
 Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
 I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
 I go back to December all the time
 
 I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
 And how you held me in your arms that September night
 The first time you ever saw me cry
 Maybe this is wishful thinking
 Probably mindless dreaming
 But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
 
 I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
 So if the chain is on your door, I understand
 
 But this is me swallowing my pride
 Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
 And I go back to December
 It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
 Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
 I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right
 I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
 I go back to December all the time all the time
 
 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look at what you've done
 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
 
  now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them
 You made a really deep cut
 And baby now we got bad blood
 
  did you have to do this?
 I was thinking that you could be trusted
 Did you have to ruin what was shining, now it's all rusted
 Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? baby I couldn't breathe
 And rubbed it in so deep
 Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
 Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
 You and I
 
 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look at what you've done
 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
 
  now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them
 You made a really deep cut
 And baby now we got bad blood
 
  did you think we'd be fine?
 Still got scars on my back from your knife
 So don't think it's in the past
 These kind of wounds they last and they last
 Now did you think it all through?
 All these things will catch up to you
 And time can heal but this won't
 So if you're coming my way, just don't
 Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times
 You and I
 
 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look at what you've done
 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
 
  now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them
 You made a really deep cut
 And baby now we got bad blood
 
  band-aids don't fix bullet holes
 You say sorry just for show
 If you live like that, you live with ghosts 
 Band-aids don't fix bullet holes 
 You say sorry just for show 
 If you live like that, you live with ghosts 
 Hm, if you love like that blood runs cold!
 
 'Cause baby now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love! 
 So take a look at what you've done
 'Cause baby now we got bad blood! 
 
  now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them 
 You made a really deep cut
 And baby now we got bad blood
 
  'cause baby now we got bad blood
 You know it used to be mad love
 So take a look at what you've done 
 'Cause baby now we got bad blood 
 Now we got problems
 And I don't think we can solve them
 You made a really deep cut
 And baby now we got bad blood 
 
 You turn your dial to 93.7
 Broadway acts like he's 11
 Self-proclaimed
 Say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan
 I'm just a singer of country songs
 Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
 But if you listen to just one thing I say
 
 You should turn Z93 on
 Broadway's Electric Barnyard
 I sing a song called Tim McGraw
 Request it and they'll play it all day long
 I sing in stations all day long
 But there's nothing like when you're on
 The Electric Barnyard
 
 Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis
 Growing up not wearing any shoes
 Prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day
 Growing up the other trailer park girls
 Couldn't hide their jealousy
 Because she had the only phone for miles
 Now she uses it as a DJ
 
 So you should turn Z93 on
 Broadway's Electric Barnyard
 I sing a song called Tim McGraw
 Request it and they'll play it all day long
 I sing in stations all day long
 But there's nothing like when you're on
 
 Your beautiful eyes
 Stare right into my eyes
 And sometimes 
 I think of you late at night, I don't know why
 I wanna be somewhere where you are
 I wanna be where
 
 You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
 So baby, make me fly
 My heart has never felt this way before
 I'm looking through your
 I'm looking through your eyes
 
 I wake up, I'm alive
 In only a little while, I'll cry
 'Cause you're my lullaby
 So baby come hold me tight 'cause I-I
 I wanna be everything you need
 I wanna be where
 
 You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
 So baby, make me fly
 My heart has never felt this way before
 I'm looking through your
 I'm looking through your eyes
 
 Just as long as you're mine
 I'll be your everything tonight
 Let me love you, kiss you
 Oh baby let me miss you, let me see your
 Dream about, dream about
 Dream about your eyes!
 Eyes, eyes, beautiful eyes
 
 Took a deep breath in the mirror
 He didn't like it when I wore high heels
 But I do
 Turn the lock and put my headphones on
 He always said he didn't get this song
 But I do, I do
 
 Walked in expecting you'd be late
 But you got here early and you stand and wave
 I walk to you
 You pull my chair out and help me in
 And you don't know how nice that is
 But I do
 
 And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
 I've been spending the last eight months
 Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
 
 You said you never met one girl
 Who had as many James Taylor records as you
 But I do
 We tell stories and you don't know why
 I'm coming off a little shy
 But I do
 
 But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
 
 I've been spending the last eight months
 Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
 
 And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
 But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
 Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
 And for the first time what's past is past
 
 'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
 I've been spending the last eight months
 
 Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
 
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
 
 All is quiet in the world tonight
 Counting stars and fireflies
 This summer sings a lullaby
 Of just me and my baby
 
 On the hood of his daddy's car
 Pass around his old guitar
 Bet mama's wondering where we are
 Just me and my baby
 
 The world is spinning 'round
 'Cause of just what I found
 
 Ooh life's so sweet right here
 Ooh keeping it young and crazy
 Ooh just want to stay right here
 'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
 
 Driving home by the riverside
 Wishing I could slow down time
 Faking pictures in my mind
 Of me and my baby
 
 The car pulls up and I'm home too late
 We didn't take that interstate
 The back-road was a better way
 For me and my baby
 
 The closer that we get
 Ooh I can't leave yet
 
 Ooh life's so sweet right here
 Ooh keeping it young and crazy
 Ooh just want to stay right here
 'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby
 
 Both know what we found
 So we turned that car around
 
 Ooh life's so sweet right here
 Ooh keeping it young and crazy
 Ooh just want to stay right here
 Ooh and be with my baby
 Ooh yeah
 And be with my baby
 
 Her hair is Harlowe gold
 Her lips sweet surprise
 Her hands are never cold
 She's got Bette Davis eyes
 She'll turn her music on you
 You won't have to think twice
 She's pure as New York snow
 She got Bette Davis eyes
 
 And she'll tease you
 She'll unease you
 All the better just to please you
 She's precocious and she knows just
 What it takes to make a pro blush
 She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
 She's got Bette Davis eyes
 
 She'll let you take her home
 It whets her appetite
 She'll lay you on her throne
 She got Bette Davis eyes
 She'll take a tumble on you
 Roll you like you were dice
 Until you come out blue
 She's got Bette Davis eyes
 
 She'll expose you, when she snows you
 Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
 She's ferocious and she knows just
 What it takes to make a pro blush
 All the boys think she's a spy
 She's got Bette Davis eyes
 
 And she'll tease you
 She'll unease you
 All the better just to please ya
 She's precocious, and she knows just
 What it takes to make a pro blush
 All the boys think she's a spy
 She's got Bette Davis eyes
 
 She'll tease you
 She'll unease you
 Just to please ya
 She's got Bette Davis eyes
 She'll expose you, when she snows you
 She knows ya
 She's got Bette Davis eyes
 
 You live down the street, in a broken down house
 And a car up on the blocks in the driveway
 The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
 That we won't forget this Sunday
 
 It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
 And it all leads to this, our first kiss
 
 All my friends are saying
 Girl what are you thinking?
 You're better off, you're better off without him
 Find yourself another,
 Girl that boy is trouble
 You're better off, you're better off
 They can talk forever, they just don't know better
 
 We drive around town in a rusty old truck
 Somehow it feels like we're flying
 Don't wanna come down
 But they make it so tough
 
 'Cause everyone we know is trying to push us apart,
 Putting doubt in our hearts,
 And they get what they want, 'cause you're gone
 
 All my friends are saying,
 Girl why are you crying?
 You're better off, you're better off without him
 Find yourself another
 Girl, that boy is trouble
 You're better off, you're better off
 They can talk forever, they just don't know better
 
 You come to my door in the pouring rain
 We know what we don't have to say
 You hand me a rose and a note that says
 'We don't have to do things their way'
 
 All my friends are saying,
 Girl, what are you thinking?
 You're better off, you're better off without him
 Find yourself another
 Girl, that boy is trouble
 You're better off, you're better off
 They can talk forever, they just don't know better
 
 Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
 Ha, time for a little revenge
 
 The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
 And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
 She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
 She took him faster than you could say sabotage
 I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
 I underestimated just who I was dealing with
 She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
 She underestimated just who she was stealing from
 
 She's not a saint and she's not what you think
 She's an actress, whoa
 She's better known for the things that she does
 On the mattress, whoa
 Soon she's gonna find
 Stealing other people's toys on the playground
 Won't make you many friends
 She should keep in mind,
 She should keep in mind
 There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
 
 She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
 She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
 I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
 And, she thinks I'm psycho
 'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
 Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
 Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
 Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
 So it's up to me
 But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
 
 She's not a saint and she's not what you think
 She's an actress, whoa
 She's better known for the things that she does
 On the mattress, whoa
 Soon she's gonna find
 Stealing other people's toys on the playground
 Won't make you many friends
 She should keep in mind,
 She should keep in mind
 There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
 
 I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
 You might have him, but haven't you heard
 I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
 You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
 Whoa
 
 She's not a saint and she's not what you think
 She's an actress, whoa
 She's better known for the things that she does
 On the mattress, whoa
 Soon she's gonna find
 Stealing other people's toys on the playground
 Won't make you many friends
 She should keep in mind,
 She should keep in mind
 There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
 
 And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
 'Cause I don't think you do, oh
 Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
 I don't think you do, I don't think you do
 Let's hear the applause
 C'mon show me how much better you are
 See you deserve some applause
 'Cause you're so much better
 She took him faster than you could say sabotage
 
 Nice to meet you, where you been?
 I could show you incredible things
 Magic, madness, heaven sin
 Saw you there and I thought
 Oh my God, look at that face
 You look like my next mistake
 Love's a game, want to play?
 New money, suit and tie
 I can read you like a magazine
 Ain't it funny, rumors, lie
 And I know you heard about me
 So hey, let's be friends
 I'm dying to see how this one ends
 Grab your passport and my hand
 I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
 
 So it's gonna be forever
 Or it's gonna go down in flames
 You can tell me when it's over
 If the high was worth the pain
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 'Cause you know I love the players
 And you love the game
 
 'Cause we're young and we're reckless
 We'll take this way too far
 It'll leave you breathless
 Or with a nasty scar
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 But I've got a blank space baby
 And I'll write your name
 
 Cherry lips, crystal skies
 I could show you incredible things
 Stolen kisses, pretty lies
 You're the king baby I'm your Queen
 Find out what you want
 Be that girl for a month
 Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
 Screaming, crying, perfect storm
 I can make all the tables turn
 Rose gardens filled with thorns
 Keep you second guessing like
 "Oh my God, who is she?"
 I get drunk on jealousy
 But you'll come back each time you leave
 'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
 
 So it's gonna be forever
 Or it's gonna go down in flames
 You can tell me when it's over
 If the high was worth the pain
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 'Cause you know I love the players
 And you love the game
 
 'Cause we're young and we're reckless
 We'll take this way too far
 It'll leave you breathless
 Or with a nasty scar
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane 
 But I've got a blank space baby
 And I'll write your name
 
 Boys only want love if it's torture
 Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
 Boys only want love if it's torture
 Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
 
 So it's gonna be forever
 Or it's gonna go down in flames
 You can tell me when it's over
 If the high was worth the pain
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 'Cause you know I love the players
 And you love the game
 
 'Cause we're young and we're reckless
 We'll take this way too far
 It'll leave you breathless
 Or with a nasty scar
 Got a long list of ex-lovers
 They'll tell you I'm insane
 But I've got a blank space baby
 And I'll write your name
 
 I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
 'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
 People are people,
 And sometimes we change our minds
 But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
 
 Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
 It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
 'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
 Now I don't know what to be without you around
 
 And we know it's never simple,
 Never easy
 Never a clean break, no one here to save me
 You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,
 
 And I can't,
 Breathe,
 Without you,
 But I have to,
 Breathe,
 Without you,
 But I have to
 
 Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
 Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
 People are people,
 And sometimes it doesn't work out,
 Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
 
 And we know it's never simple,
 Never easy
 Never a clean break, no one here to save me
 You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,
 
 And I can't,
 Breathe,
 Without you,
 But I have to,
 Breathe,
 Without you,
 But I have to
 
 It's two am
 Feelin' like I just lost a friend
 Hope you know it's not easy,
 Easy for me
 
 It's two am
 Feelin' like I just lost a friend
 Hope you know this ain't easy,
 Easy for me
 
 And we know it's never simple,
 Never easy
 Never a clean break, no one here to save me
 
 I can't,
 Breathe,
 Without you,
 But I have to,
 Breathe,
 Without you,
 But I have to
 
 Breathe,
 Without you,
 But I have to
 
 Sorry  sorry
 Sorry sorry
 Sorry sorry
 
 Here you are now
 Fresh from your war
 Back from the edge of time
 And all that you were
 Stripped to the bone
 I thought you' d want to know
 
 That when you feel the world is crashing
 All around your feet
 Come running headlong into my arms
 Breathless
 I'll never judge you
 I can only love you
 Come now running headlong
 Into my arms
 Breathless
 
 Lay down your guns
 Too weak to run
 Nothing can harm you here
 Your precious heart
 Broken and scarred
 Somehow you made it through
 I only ask that you won't go again
 
 When you feel the world is crashing
 All around your feet
 Come running headlong into my arms
 Breathless
 I'll never judge you
 I can only love you
 Come now running headlong
 Into my arms
 Breathless
 
 I'm so glad to see you smiling
 So good to hear your laugh
 I think that you've found you even
 Missed yourself
 I'm only asking this because I think that
 Truth be told
 Oh, you'll never go again
 Again
 
 When you feel the world is crashing
 All around your feet
 Come running headlong into my arms
 Breathless
 I'll never judge you
 I can only love you
 Come now running headlong
 Into my arms
 Breathless
 Breathless
 So when you feel the world is crashing down
 I want you come run into my arms
 
 Emily comes home from school
 Grabs onto her daddy's hand
 He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
 She says, "Please don't make me go back there again."
 
 She said, "I wish there was someway to make them stop it."
 So he drives down to that principles office
 And says, "I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
 I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
 I'd live my whole damn life to see that little girl smile
 So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
 She wasn't brought up that way."
 
 Emily's home late again
 He sees that boy drive away
 Oh but something's different this time
 She doesn't have too much to say
 She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do"
 And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you"
 
 And he said, "I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
 Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
 I'd live my whole damn life to see my little girl smile
 So don't let nobody take that away
 You weren't brought up that way."
 
 The phone rings on a rainy night
 Says, "It's Officer Tate"
 He said, "Sir, there's been an accident
 You'd better come down here right away
 A drunken driver missed an overpass
 And Emily she's fading fast."
 
 He says, "God I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her  down
 Nearly killed me the day they put her mama in the ground
 Only thing that kept me alive was that little girls smile
 So please don't take that away
 It won't be easy taking her today, she wasn't brought up that way."
 
 He stands over the hospital bed
 Emily opens her eyes
 
 I had to catch my breath when I saw you there 
 Across the room holding her hand
 I'd never guessed starting over would be so good on you 
 But here I am still believing there might come a day
 We'll pick up where we left off...
 
 By the way your eyes are dancing
 I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
 By the way my heart's still breaking
 It's going to take me awhile to love again
 So many things that I forgot to say, by the way.
 
 I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
 Guess it's too late
 So I'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night
 Give you one last wave
 Maybe you'll drop what you're doing come over here and say 
 "I'm looking good."
 
 But by the way your eyes are dancing
 I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
 By the way my heart's still breaking
 It's going to take me awhile to love again
 So many things that I forgot to say.
 
 By the way you still look amazing
 And I must've been crazy to let you get away
 By the way, if you ever wonder
 I still have the same old number just in case.
 I still miss you, and I still love you, by the way.
 By the way...
 
 My castle crumbled overnight
 I brought a knife to a gunfight
 They took the crown, but it's alright
 All the liars are calling me one
 Nobody's heard from me for months
 I'm doing better than I ever was, 'cause
 
 My baby's fit like a daydream
 Walking with his head down
 I'm the one he's walking to
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 My baby's fly like a jet stream
 High above the whole scene
 Loves me like I'm brand new
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 
 All my flowers grew back as thorns
 Windows boarded up after the storm
 He built a fire just to keep me warm
 All the drama queens taking swings
 All the jokers dressin' up as kings
 They fade to nothing when I look at him
 And I know I make the same mistakes every time
 Bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right
 I did one thing right
 I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers
 Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right
 Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night
 
 My baby's fit like a daydream
 Walking with his head down
 I'm the one he's walking to
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 My baby's fly like a jet stream
 High above the whole scene
 Loves me like I'm brand new
 
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 
 I want to wear his initial
 On a chain round my neck, chain round my neck
 Not because he owns me
 But 'cause he really knows me
 Which is more than they can say, I
 I recall late November, holdin' my breath
 Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me
 But would you run away with me?"
 Yes 
 
 My baby's fit like a daydream
 Walking with his head down
 I'm the one he's walking to
 
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 My baby's fly like a jet stream
 High above the whole scene
 Loves me like I'm brand new
 
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 
 Call it what you want, yeah
 Call it what you want
 To
 
 Any day now
 They're talking war
 I can see the light
 That's in your eyes
 They're not talking
 A week or two
 Oh, daddy
 Can I go with you?
 Oh, daddy
 Can I go with you?
 
 You pack a suitcase
 And take a picture
 From the wall
 I always knew
 This time would come
 When I ask how long
 You think
 You're going to be
 You say
 "Eh, this crazy world's
 Come undone"
 
 Summer's over
 And leaves begin
 To fall
 And another winter's
 On the way
 I knew
 I wasn't going to take
 This very well
 But I'd give everything
 To have you here today
 
 Every day now
 They're talking war
 I know
 This time has been
 Like it's never
 Been before
 We're not talking
 About a week or two
 Oh, daddy
 Can I go with you?
 Oh, daddy
 Can I go with you?
 Oh, daddy
 
 And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
 Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
 You know it's all the same, another time and place
 Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
 But I believe in whatever you do
 And I'll do anything to see it through
 
 Because these things will change
 Can you feel it now?
 These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
 It's a revolution, the time will come
 For us to finally win
 And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
 
 So we've been outnumbered
 Raided and now cornered
 It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
 We're getting stronger now
 Find things they never found
 They might be bigger
 But we're faster and never scared
 You can walk away, say we don't need this
 But there's something in your eyes
 Says we can beat this
 
 Because these things will change
 Can you feel it now?
 These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
 It's a revolution, the time will come
 For us to finally win
 And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
 
 Tonight we'll stand, get off our knees
 Fight for what we've worked for all these years
 And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
 But we'll stand up champions tonight
 
 It was the night things changed
 Can you see it now?
 These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
 It's a revolution, throw your hands up
 'Cause we never gave in
 And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
 Hallelujah
 
 What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
 Would the song still survive without five golden rings
 Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
 What would happen if God never let it snow
 What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie
 Tell me what would you find
 
 You'd see that today holds something special
 Something holy, not superficial
 So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
 It's something we all try to ignore
 And put a wreath up on your door
 So here's something you should know that is for sure
 Christmas must be something more
 
 What if angels did not pay attention to
 All the things that we wished they would always do
 What if happiness came in a cardboard box
 Then I think there is something we all forgot
 What would happen if presents all went away
 Tell me what would you find
 
 You'd see that today holds something special
 Something holy, not superficial
 So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
 It's something we all try to ignore
 And put a wreath up on your door
 So here's something you should know that is for sure
 Christmas must be something more
 
 We get so caught up in all of it
 Business and relationships
 Hundred mile an hour lives
 And it's this time of year
 And everybody's here
 It seems the last thing on your mind
 
 Is that the day holds something special
 Something holy, not superficial
 So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
 It's something we all try to ignore
 And put a wreath up on your door
 But here's something you should know that is for sure
 Christmas must be something
 Christmas must be something
 Christmas must be something more
 
 There's gotta be more
 There's gotta be more
 
 Please take down the mistletoe
 'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
 'Cause everything I want is miles away
 Snow covered little town
 My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
 Season's greetings, hope you're well
 Well I'm doing alright
 If you were wondering
 Lately I can never tell
 
 I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
 But there were Christmases when you were mine
 
 I've been doing fine without you, really
 Up until the nights got cold
 And everybody's here, except you, baby
 Seems like everyone's got someone to hold
 
 But for me it's just a lonely time
 'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
 
 Merry Christmas everybody
 That'll have to be something I just say this year
 I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
 And were your cousins late again
 When you were putting up the lights this year
 Did you notice one less pair of hands
 
 I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
 But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
 'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
 
 You were mine
 
 The drought was the very worst, ah ah
 When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
 It was months, and months of back and forth, ah ah
 You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
 Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
 
 Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
 That's when I could finally breathe
 And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
 
 There was nothing left to do, ah ah
 When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
 So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
 Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
 The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing
 
 Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
 That's when I could finally breathe
 And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
 I think I am finally clean, ah
 Said, I think I am finally clean, ah
 
 Ten months sober, I must admit
 Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
 Ten months older I won't give in
 Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it
 
 The drought was the very worst, ah ah
 When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
 
 Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
 That's when I could finally breathe
 And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
 Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
 That's when I could finally breathe
 And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
 Finally clean, think I'm finally clean, ah ah
 Think I'm finally clean
 
 I drive around this town in a Mustang with the top down
 And six running horses under my hood
 Well that's good enough for me
 
 Don't need the real thing
 That's just another thing for me to try to tame
 Don't know if I could
 It might just break me
 
 I thought that for a little while
 Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him
 
 Snap buttons on a denim shirt
 Blue jeans and a little dirt
 That's the closest you'll see me
 
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck
 Crazy and a little rough, running free
 That's the closest to a cowboy
 You'll see me
 
 Before I met him
 I was so sane and grounded
 Before he taught me how to lie
 And crawl out the window
 
 I learned the dirt roads
 And I got my heart broken
 'Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
 And how to let go
 
 I thought that for a little while
 Every sunset I'd be riding off with him
 
 Snap buttons on a denim shirt
 Blue jeans and a little dirt
 That's the closest you'll see me
 
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck
 Crazy and a little rough, running free
 That's the closest to a cowboy
 You'll see me
 
 It was all a bit wonderful and strange
 But I'll never look at a sunset the same like,
 
 Snap buttons on a denim shirt
 Blue jeans and a little dirt
 That's the closest you'll see me
 
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck
 Crazy and a little rough, running free
 
 Sitting fishing by the river bank
 Swimming in the water tank
 That's the closest you'll see me
 
 Feet hanging out a pickup truck
 Crazy and a little rough, running free
 That's the closest to a cowboy
 You'll see me
 
 You have a way of coming easily to me
 And when you take, you take the very best of me
 So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel somethin'
 And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
 
 Oh, what a shame
 What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
 Just walk away
 Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
 And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
 I've never been anywhere cold as you
 
 You put up the walls and paint them all a shade of gray
 And I stood there loving you, and wished them all away
 And you come away with a great little story
 Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
 
 Oh, what a shame
 What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
 Just walk away
 Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
 And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
 I've never been anywhere cold as you
 
 You never did give a damn thing, honey
 But I cried, cried for you
 And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you
 Died for you
 
 Oh, what a shame
 What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
 Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
 Countin' all the scars you've made
 Now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through
 I've never been anywhere cold as you
 
 You said it in a simple way,
 4 AM, the second day,
 How strange that I don't know you at all.
 Stumbled through the long goodbye,
 One last kiss, then catch your flight,
 Right when I was just about to fall
 
 I told myself don't get attached,
 But in my mind I play it back,
 Spinning faster than the plane that took you,
 
 And this is when the feeling sinks in,
 I don't wanna miss you like this,
 Come back, be here, come back, be here.
 I guess you're in New York today,
 I don't wanna need you this way,
 Come back, be here, come back, be here.
 
 The delicate beginning rush,
 The feeling you can know so much,
 Without knowing anything at all.
 And now that I can put this down,
 If I had known what I know now,
 I never would have played so nonchalant.
 
 Taxi cabs and busy streets,
 That never bring you back to me,
 I can't help but wish you took me with you,
 
 And this is when the feeling sinks in,
 I don't wanna miss you like this,
 Come back, be here, come back, be here.
 I guess you're in London today,
 And I don't wanna need you this way,
 Come back, be here, come back, be here.
 
 This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
 This is falling for you and you are worlds away.
 
 New York, be here.
 But you're in London and I break down,
 'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.
 
 This is when the feeling sinks in,
 I don't wanna miss you like this,
 Come back, be here, come back, be here.
 I guess you're in New York today,
 And I don't wanna need you this way,
 Come back, be here, come back, be here.
 
 I don't wanna miss you like this.
 Come back, be here.
 Come back, be here.
 
 I could go back to every laugh
 But I don't wanna go there anymore and I 
 know all the steps up to your door
 But I don't wanna go there anymore
 
 Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
 Talk to the man with the reasons why
 And let me know what you find
 
 I'll leave my window open
 'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name
 Just know I'm right here hoping
 That you'll come in with the rain
 
 I could stand up and sing you a song
 But I don't wanna have to go that far and I
 I've got you down
 I know you by heart
 And you don't even know where I start
 
 Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
 Talk to the man who put you here
 And don't wait for the sky to clear
 
 I'll leave my window open
 'Cause I'm too tired tonight to call your name oh
 Just know I'm right here hoping
 That you'll come in with the rain
 
 I've watched you so long, screamed your name
 I don't know what else I can say
 
 But I'll leave my window open
 'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
 Just know I'm right here hoping
 That you'll come in with the rain
 
 I could go back to every laugh
 But I don't wanna go there anymore
 
 I've never gone with the wind, just let it flow
 Let it take me where it wants
 'Til you opened the door, there's so much more
 I've never seen it before
 I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings
 But you came along and you changed everything
 
 You lift my feet off the ground
 You spin me around
 You make me crazier crazier
 Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes
 You make me crazier crazier crazier
 
 I watched from a distance as you made life your own
 Every sky was your own kind of blue
 And I wanted to know how that would feel
 And you made it so real
 You showed me something that I couldn't see
 You opened my eyes and you made me believe.
 
 You lift my feet off the ground
 You spin me around
 You make me crazier crazier
 Feels like I'm falling and I'm lost in your eyes
 You make me crazier,crazier,crazier oh
 
 Baby you showed me what livin' is for
 I don't wanna hide anymore
 
 You lift my feet off the ground
 You spin me around
 You make me crazier crazier
 Feels like I'm falling and I'm, I'm lost in your eyes
 You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
 Crazier, crazier
 
 I, I loved you in secret
 First sight, yeah, we love without reason
 Oh, twenty-five years old
 Oh, how were you to know, and
 My, my love had been frozen
 Deep blue, but you painted me golden
 Oh, and you held me close
 Oh, how was I to know that
 
 I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
 Picture of your face in an invisible locket
 You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
 I had a bad feeling
 And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
 People started talking, putting us through our paces
 I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
 I had a bad feeling
 
 But we were dancing
 Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
 Yeah, we were dancing
 Like it was the first time, first time
 Yeah, we were dancing
 Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
 Yeah, we were dancing
 And I had a bad feeling
 But we were dancing
 
 I, I loved you in spite of
 Deep fears that the world would divide us
 So, baby, can we dance
 Oh, through an avalanche?
 And say, say that we got it
 I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
 Oh, 'cause it's gravity
 Oh, keeping you with me
 
 I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
 Picture of your face in an invisible locket
 You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
 I had a bad feeling
 
 But we were dancing
 Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
 Yeah, we were dancing
 Like it was the first time, first time
 Yeah, we were dancing
 Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
 Yeah, we were dancing
 
 And I had a bad feeling
 But we were dancing
 
 I'd kiss you as the lights went out
 Swaying as the room burned down
 I'd hold you as the water rushes in
 If I could dance with you again
 I'd kiss you as the lights went out
 Swaying as the room burned down
 I'd hold you as the water rushes in
 If I could dance with you again
 
 Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
 Yeah, we were dancing
 Like it was the first time, first time
 Yeah, we were dancing
 Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
 Yeah, we were dancing
 And I had a bad feeling
 But we were dancing
 Hands tied, hands tied
 
 He said, I got me a nice new apartment
 In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
 I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with.
 He hangs up the phone and she whispers back,
 
 Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
 Won't you come back to me?
 I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
 In dark blue Tennessee
 
 He was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
 He's just hiding out on the other side of town
 With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
 He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying,
 
 Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
 Won't you come back to me?
 I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
 In dark blue Tennessee
 
 She almost called him on the night that he wrote
 These simple words on his goodbye note
 
 Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
 Won't you come back to me?
 I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
 In dark blue Tennessee
 
 In dark blue Tennessee
 
 Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
 Counting my footsteps,
 Praying the floor won't fall through, again
 My mother accused me of losing my mind,
 But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky
 And go back and turn it to rain
 And I lived in your chess game,
 But you changed the rules every day
 Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
 Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why
 
 Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
 Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
 The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known
 
 Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
 Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
 And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
 And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said "run as fast as you can"
 
 Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
 Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
 The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home
 
 Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong
 Don't you think nineteen is too young
 To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?
 I should've known
 
 You are an expert at sorry,
 And keeping the lines blurry
 Never impressed by me acing your tests
 All the girls that you've run dry
 Have tired, lifeless eyes
 'Cause you burned them out
 But I took your matches before fire could catch me,
 So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
 
 Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
 Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
 The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.
 
 I see it all now that you're gone
 Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
 The girl in the dress wrote you a song
 You should've known, you should've known
 Don't you think I was too young? You should've known
 
 This ain't for the best
 My reputation's never been worse, so
 You must like me for me
 We can't make
 Any promises now, can we, babe?
 But you can make me a drink
 
 Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
 Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
 Come here, you can meet me in the back
 Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
 Oh damn, never seen that color blue
 Just think of the fun things we could do
 'Cause I like you
 
 This ain't for the best
 My reputation's never been worse, so
 You must like me for me
 Yeah, I want you
 We can't make
 Any promises now, can we, babe?
 But you can make me a drink
 
 Is it cool that I said all that?
 Is it chill that you're in my head?
 'Cause I know that it's delicate 
 Is it cool that I said all that
 Is it too soon to do this yet?
 'Cause I know that it's delicate
 Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
 Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
 Delicate
 
 Third floor on the West Side, me and you
 Handsome, your mansion with a view
 Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
 Long night, with your hands up in my hair
 Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
 Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
 'Cause I like you
 
 This ain't for the best
 My reputation's never been worse, so
 You must like me for me
 Yeah, I want you
 We can't make
 Any promises now, can we, babe?
 But you can make me a drink
 
 Is it cool that I said all that?
 Is it chill that you're in my head?
 'Cause I know that it's delicate 
 Is it cool that I said all that
 Is it too soon to do this yet?
 'Cause I know that it's delicate
 Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
 Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
 Delicate
 
 Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
 Are you ever dreaming of me?
 Sometimes when I look into your eyes
 I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
 'Cause I like you
 
 Is it cool that I said all that?
 Is it chill that you're in my head?
 'Cause I know that it's delicate 
 Yeah, I want you
 Is it cool that I said all that
 Is it too soon to do this yet?
 'Cause I know that it's delicate 
 'Cause I like you
 Is it cool that I said all that?
 Is it chill that you're in my head?
 'Cause I know that it's delicate 
 Yeah, I want you
 Is it cool that I said all that
 Is it too soon to do this yet?
 'Cause I know that it's delicate
 Delicate
 
 I'm a laid back
 T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
 Kinda girl
 Hey yeah what's the word on you
 Lay low I'm a mission rebel
 Angel devil
 Little lamb upper mental
 Sometimes I get temperamental
 
 But here I am an open book
 Turn the page it's all the rage
 Get a look on the inside
 Oh what you get is what you see
 Baby you hold the key
 To the diary of me
 
 I'm poetry, complicated
 Simply stated
 Hey yeah baby how about you
 I was born free
 I'm a cell phone hippie
 Are you with me?
 When I mess up I don't get up
 I just get down yeah
 
 But here I am an open book
 Turn the page it's all the rage
 Get a look on the inside
 Oh what you get is what you see
 Baby you hold the key
 To the diary of me
 
 It's raining on Sunday
 There's nothing on TV
 Yesterday was lonely
 You're the only one who gets me
 My mind is like an island
 Drifting through the ocean
 I can't stop thinking about you
 I bet you're thinking of me too
 
 Well here I am an open book
 Turn the page it's all the rage
 Get a look on the inside
 Oh what you get is what you see
 Baby you hold the key
 To the diary of me
 Yeah here I am an open book
 Turn the page it's all the rage
 Get a look on the inside
 Oh what you get is what you see
 Baby you hold the key
 To the diary of me
 
 She walks to school with her arms crossed
 It's just another day-at ten o'clock she hears this screaming
 Then finally she sees them
 It's scary how things change.
 
 And I saw the story on the news
 I saw the footage from the roof
 I sat down and cried!
 
 Didn't she call you? 
 Didn't she need you bad enough?
 Was there some reason, another way up?
 Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
 Where were you, didn't she pray too?
 
 He kissed his wife goodbye and took the earliest flight
 So he could be home that night to put his kids to sleep
 Down the aisle, three men walked and said:
 "We're here to die for our God,"
 He stood up and said:
 "That's funny because my God died for me!"
 
 I put the magazine down
 I read his words out loud
 I sat down and cried!
 
 Didn't he call you?
 Didn't he need you bad enough?
 Was there some reason, another way up?
 Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
 Where were you and didn't he pray too?
 
 The taxis pulled up on the very day of
 They road a hundred floors up just to come back down
 They never thought they'd see the day the tower's up in flames
 There was nothing left to say when it all came down.
 
 And didn't they call you?
 Didn't they need you bad enough?
 Was there some reason, another way up?
 Did you not write it down, just one more thing to do?
 Where were you, where were you?
 And didn't they pray too? Oh. 
 
 I walk to school and I wear a cross
 I'm counting every day.
 
 Don't blame me, love made me crazy
 If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
 Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
 I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
 
 I've been breakin' hearts a long time, and
 Toyin' with them older guys
 Just to play things for me to use
 Something happened for the first time, in
 The darkest little paradise
 Shakin, pacin', I just need you
 
 For you, I would cross the line
 I would waste my time
 I would lose my mind
 They say she's gone too far this time
 
 Don't blame me, love made me crazy
 If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
 Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
 I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
 Don't blame me, love made me crazy
 If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
 Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
 I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
 
 My name is whatever you decide
 And I'm just gonna call you mine
 I'm insane, but I'm your baby 
 Echoes, love your name inside my mind
 Halo, hiding my obsession
 I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy
 
 And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
 Just to touch your face
 If you walk away
 I'd beg you on my knees to stay
 
 Don't blame me, love made me crazy
 If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
 Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
 I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
 Don't blame me, love made me crazy
 If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
 Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
 I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
 
 I get so high, oh
 Every time, yeah every time you're lovin' me
 You're lovin' me
 Trip of my life, oh
 Every time, yeah every time you're touchin' me
 You're touchin' me
 
 Every time, yeah every time you're lovin' me
 Oh Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
 I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
 Usin' for the rest of my life, oh
 
 Don't blame me, love made me crazy
 If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right 
 Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
 I'd be usin' for the rest of my life, oh
 Don't blame me, love made me crazy
 If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right 
 Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
 I'd be usin' for the rest of my life 
 
 I get so high, oh
 Every time, yeah every time you're lovin' me
 You're lovin' me
 Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
 I'd be usin' for the rest of my life
 
 My mama stood across the room
 Face to face but never eye to eye
 Recalling words we said
 The battle that we swore
 We'd never fight
 
 Breaking pieces off with every lie
 A tear came to her eye
 And she said
 
 Don't walk away now
 And don't rip my heart out
 Don't you block me out tonight
 Honey where are you?
 And don't hate me for loving you
 
 He walked around my life
 And made blind
 With every single move
 He caught me staring at him
 Mad about him
 
 Little that I knew
 Love is different
 When you play the fool
 And all I wanna do is say
 
 Don't walk away now
 And don't rip my heart out
 Don't you make cry tonight
 Like you always do
 And don't hate me for loving you
 
 I slammed the door
 Sat on the floor
 Cried into my bed
 Said are you there?
 Do you even care?
 To cross above my head
 But someone said
 
 Don't turn away now
 And don't rip my heart out
 Things are meant to happen like this
 I know it's right for you
 And don't hate me for loving you
 
 I looked up at the sky
 Face to face and finally
 Eye to eye
 
 Our secret moments in a crowded room
 They've got no idea about me and you
 There is an indentation in the shape of you
 Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo
 
 All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation
 My hands are shaking from holding back from you 
 All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
 My hands are shaking from holding back from all this 
 
 Say my name and everything just stops
 I don't want you like a best friend
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off
 Take it off 
 Carve your name into my bedpost
 'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off
 Take it off 
 
 Inescapable, I'm not even going to try
 And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
 I'm spilling wine in the bathtub, you kiss my face and we're both drunk
 Everyone thinks that they know us, but they know nothing about
 
 All of this silence and patience, pining in anticipation
 My hands are shaking from holding back from you 
 All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
 My hands are shaking from holding back from all this 
 
 Say my name and everything just stops
 I don't want you like a best friend
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off
 Take it off 
 Carve your name into my bedpost
 'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off 
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off 
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off
 
 Flashback when you met me
 Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
 Even in my worst times, you could see the best of me
 Flashback to my mistakes
 My rebounds, my earthquakes
 Even in my worst light, you saw the truth of me
 And I woke up just in time
 Now I wake up by your side
 My one and only, my lifeline
 I woke up just in time
 Now I wake up by your side
 My hands are shaking, and I can't explain this 
 
 Say my name and everything just stops
 I don't want you like a best friend
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off 
 Carve your name into my bedpost
 'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off 
 
 There is an indentation
 In the shape of you
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off
 You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
 Only bought this dress so you could take it off
 
 I know you guys have a lot of amazing bands
 From this part of the world, did you know that?
 
 Well now he's back in the atmosphere
 With drops of Jupiter in his hair, ay ay ay
 Ay ay ay
 He walks like summer and talks like rain
 Reminds me that there's time to cha ay ange
 Ay ay ange
 But since his return from the stay on the moon
 He listens like spring and he talks like June, ay ay 
 Ay Ay 
 
 But tell me did you sail across the sun
 Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
 That heaven is overrated, tell me
 Did you fall for a shooting star
 One without a permanent scar and did you miss me while you were 
 Looking for yourself out there 
 
 Well now he's back from that soul vacation
 Chasing his way through the constellation, ay ay ay
 Ay ay ay
 He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
 Reminds me that there's room to grow, ay ay ay
 Ay ay ay
 
 Well now he's back in the atmosphere
 I'm afraid that he might think of me as 
 Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man 
 Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 
 
 Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
 Did you finally get the chance to dance 
 Along in the light of day yeah
 Head back to the Milky Way
 And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
 Was it everything you wanted to find and did you miss me while you were 
 Looking for yourself out there 
 
 Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
 Your best friend always sticking up for you
 Even when I know you're wrong can you imagine 
 No first dance, freeze dried romance 
 Five-hour phone conversation
 The best soy latte you have ever had and me
 
 Just tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
 Did you finally get the chance to dance 
 Along in the light of day yeah
 Head back toward the Milky Way
 And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
 One without a permanent scar and did you miss me while you were 
 Looking for yourself?
 
 Nana nana nana 
 Nana nana nana na-ah
 Oh oh oh
 
 Nana nana nana 
 Nana nana nana na-ah
 Oh oh oh
 
 Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
 Your best friend always sticking up for you
 Even when I know you're wrong can you imagine 
 No first dance, freeze dried romance 
 Five-hour phone conversation
 The best soy latte that you ever had and me
 
 Thank you so much
 
 There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
 Same old tired, lonely place
 Walls of insincerity
 Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
 All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
 
 Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
 Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
 The playful conversation starts
 Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy
 And it was enchanting to meet you
 All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
 
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
 I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
 I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 I was enchanted to meet you
 
 The lingering question kept me up
 Two a.m., who do you love?
 I wonder till I'm wide awake
 Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
 I'd open up and you would say, hey
 It was enchanting to meet you
 All I know is I was, enchanted to meet you
 
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
 I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
 I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 This night is flawless, don't you let it go
 I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
 I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 I was enchanted to meet you
 
 This is me praying that this was the very first page
 Not where the story line ends
 My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
 These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
 I was enchanted to meet you
 Please don't be in love with someone else
 Please don't have somebody waiting on you
 Please don't be in love with someone else
 Please don't have somebody waiting on you
 
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
 I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
 I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 This night is flawless, don't you let it go
 I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
 I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 I was enchanted to meet you
 
 Please don't be in love with someone else
 Please don't have somebody waiting on you
 
 I wanna be your endgame
 I wanna be your first string
 I wanna be your A-Team
 I wanna be your endgame, endgame
 
 Big reputation, big reputation
 Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ah
 And you heard about me, ooh
 I got some big enemies
 
 Big reputation, big reputation
 Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ah
 And I heard about you, ooh
 You like the bad ones too
 
 You so dope, don't overdose
 I'm so stoked, I need a toast
 We do the most
 I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
 I got a reputation girl, that don't precede me
 I'm one call away, whenever you need me
 I'm in a G5
 Come to the A side
 I got a bad boy persona that's what they like
 You love it
 I love it too 'cause you my type
 You hold me down and I protect you with my life
 
 I don't wanna touch you 
 Just anther ex-love 
 I don't wanna miss you 
 Like the other girls do
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 Drinkin' on a beach with 
 I know what they all say 
 But I ain't tryna play
 
 I wanna be your endgame
 I wanna be your first string
 I wanna be your A Team
 I wanna be your endgame, endgame
 
 Knew her when I was young
 Reconnected when we were little bit older
 Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
 Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee deep
 The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
 Even when we'd argue, we don't do it for long
 And you understand the good and bad, end up in the song
 For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
 For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
 I've made mistakes, and made some choices that's hard to deny
 After the storm, something was born on the fourth of July
 I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
 With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say
 
 I don't wanna touch you 
 Just anther ex-love 
 I don't wanna miss you 
 Like the other girls do
 I don't wanna hurt you 
 Drinkin' on a beach with 
 I know what they all say
 But I ain't tryna play
 
 I wanna be your endgame
 I wanna be your first string
 I wanna be your A Team
 I wanna be your endgame, endgame
 
 Big reputation, big reputation
 Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ahh
 And you heard about me, ooh
 I got some big enemies
 
 Big reputation, big reputation
 Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ahh
 And I heard about you, ooh
 You like the bad ones too
 
 I hit you like bang
 We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
 And I bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put 'em
 Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
 I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
 And I can't let you go, your hand print's on my soul
 It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
 You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
 So here's the truth from my red lips
 
 I wanna be your endgame
 I wanna be your first string
 I wanna be your A Team
 I wanna be your endgame, endgame
 
 I wanna be your endgame
 I wanna be your first string
 I wanna be your A Team
 I wanna be your endgame, endgame
 
 All I knew this morning when I woke
 Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before
 And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago is green eyes and freckles
 And your smile in the back of my mind making me feel like
 I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just want to know you, know you, know you
 
 'Cause all I know is we said hello
 And your eyes look like coming home
 All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
 All I know is you held the door
 You'll be mine and I'll be yours
 All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
 
 And all my walls stood tall painted blue
 But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down and open up the door for you
 
 And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies the beautiful kind
 Making up for lost time, taking flight, making me feel like
 
 I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just want to know you, know you, know you
 
 'Cause all I know is we said hello
 And your eyes look like coming home
 All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
 All I know is you held the door
 You'll be mine and I'll be yours
 All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
 
 Come back and tell me why
 I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
 And meet me there tonight
 And let me know that it's not all in my mind
 
 I just want to know you better, know you better, know you better now
 I just want to know you, know you, know you
 
 All I know is we said hello
 Your eyes look like coming home
 All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
 All I know is he held the door
 You'll be mine and I'll be yours
 All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
 
 All I know is we said hello
 So dust off your highest hopes
 All I know is pouring rain
 And everything has changed
 All I know is a new found grace
 All my days, I'll know your face
 All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
 
 Everybody's waiting
 Everybody's watching
 Even when you're sleeping
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 
 The tricky thing
 Is yesterday we were just children
 Playing soldiers just pretending
 Dreaming dreams with happy endings
 In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
 But now we've stepped into a cruel world
 Where everybody stands and keeps score
 
 Keep your eyes open
 
 Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
 Everybody's watching to see the fallout
 Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 
 So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
 Every lesson forms a new scar
 They never thought you'd make it this far
 But turn around , oh they've surrounded you
 It's a showdown  and nobody comes to save you now
 But you've got something they don't
 Yeah you've got something they don't
 You've just gotta keep your eyes open
 
 Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
 Everybody's watching to see the fallout
 Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes
 
 Keep your feet ready
 Heartbeat steady
 Keep your eyes open
 Keep your aim locked
 The night goes dark
 Keep your eyes open 
 
 Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
 Everybody's watching to see the fallout
 Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
 
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 Keep your ey-eyes open
 
 Isn't it funny how many times we can say
 We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page
 And moved on
 That's what we thought
 
 But here I am in the same old car
 Having myself another same old brown-eyed bar
 Uh oh, uh oh
 
 I won't tell nobody
 I won't tell my friends
 We'll just drive down this road until the one we're on ends
 And we'll tell each other things like "I need you"
 
 You and me
 Baby, this is what we do
 I may see
 There are people you just come back to
 So fall back on me
 Fall back on you
 
 You always let someone come in between
 You're talking around the truth and never say what we mean
 Look at all this wasted time
 
 I won't tell nobody
 I won't tell my friend
 We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
 And we'll tell each other things like "I love you"
 
 You and me
 Baby, this is what we do
 I may see
 There are people who you come back to
 So fall back on me, 
 Fall back on you
 
 Maybe we'll last
 Maybe we won't
 Maybe we'll stop talking or talk like girls
 But just, baby, get along with me
 
 You and me
 Baby, this is what we do
 I may see
 There are people that you come back to
 Fall back on me
 Baby, I'll fall back on you
 Fall back on me baby,
 Baby, I'll fall back on you
 Fall back on you
 
 Fall back on you
 
 You say you've turned it off
 Hid your heart up on a shelf
 Scared of what it might cost
 To take it off for someone else
 Because loving him, you lost
 Too much of yourself
 Baby, can't you see that she's not me and . . .
 
 I need you to know you can fall into me
 That my arms are wide open
 And will always be
 Right here waiting, staying strong
 Come and fall into me
 
 I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you
 I'll open up my soul
 If that's what you need me to do
 But now, baby, it's your move
 All you've got to do
 Is believe in love, just believe in us now
 
 I need you to know you can fall into me
 That my arms are wide open
 And will always be
 Right here waiting, staying strong
 Come and fall into me
 
 Just believe in love
 Just believe in us
 Baby . . .
 
 I need you to know you can fall into me
 That my arms are wide open
 And will always be
 Right here waiting, staying strong
 Come and fall into me
 
 Come and fall into me
 Baby, fall into me
 
 There's somethin' bout the way
 The street looks when it's just rained
 There's a glow off the pavement
 Walk me to the car
 And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
 In the middle of the parking lot
 Yeah
 
 We're drivin' down the road
 I wonder if you know
 I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
 But you're just so cool
 Run your hands through your hair
 Absent mindedly makin' me want you
 
 And I don't know how it gets better than this
 You take my hand and drag me head first
 Fearless
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
 In a storm in my best dress
 Fearless
 
 So baby drive slow
 Til we run out of road in this one horse town
 I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
 You put your eyes on me
 In this moment now capture it remember it
 
 And I don't know how it gets better than this
 You take my hand and drag me head first
 Fearless
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
 In a storm in my best dress
 Fearless
 
 Well you stood there with me in the doorway
 my hands shake
 I'm not usually this way but
 You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
 It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless.
 
 And I don't know how it gets better than this
 You take my hand and drag me head first
 Fearless
 And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
 In a storm in my best dress
 Fearless
 
 You take a deep breath
 And you walk through the doors
 It's the morning of your very first day
 You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in awhile
 Try and stay out of everybody's way
 
 It's your freshman year
 And you're gonna be here for the next four years
 In this town
 Hoping one of those senior boys
 Will wink at you and say, "you know I haven't seen you around, before"
 
 'Cause when you're fifteen,
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 
 Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
 
 Count to ten
 Take it in
 This is life before you know who you're gonna be
 At fifteen
 
 You sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail
 And soon enough you're best friends
 Laughing at the other girls
 Who they think they're so cool
 We'll be out of here as soon as we can
 
 And then you're on your very first date
 And he's got a car
 And you're feeling like flying
 And you're mama's waiting up
 And you're thinking he's the one
 And you're dancing around the room when the night ends
 When the night ends
 
 'Cause when you're fifteen,
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 
 And your first kiss makes your head spin around
 
 But in your life you'll do things
 Greater than dating the boy on the football team
 But I didn't know it at fifteen
 
 When all you wanted
 Was to be wanted
 Wish you could go back
 And tell yourself what you know now
 
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
 And Abigail gave everything she had
 To a boy who changed his mind
 And we both cried
 
 'Cause when you're fifteen,
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 
 Don't forget to look before you fall
 
 I've found time can heal most anything
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be
 I didn't know who I was supposed to be
 At fifteen
 
 La la la la la
 Your very first day
 Take a deep breath girl
 And take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
 
 Someone struck a match against the night
 All I could see was you and I, I was captivated 
 A perfect little dream inside my head
 And then reality crept in and erased it.
 For a while I thought that I could hold you 
 But you were just a temporary high.
 
 Firefly, you drew me to you
 Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
 And you don't know it do you?
 I wish I could keep you, firefly, firefly.
 
 Something so beautiful and free
 Was as never meant to be caged in
 I thought I had you in my hand, I tried to catch you
 But I can't chase the wind
 And every time I reach out to touch you
 I remind myself you were meant to fly.
 
 Firefly, you drew me to you
 Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
 And you don't know it do you?
 I wish I could keep you, firefly, firefly.
 
 I'd like to think I'd be all that you wanted
 But not even that is enough...
 
 Firefly, you drew me to you
 Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
 And you don't know it do you?
 I wish I could keep you, I wish I could keep you firefly, firefly.
 
 Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
 And we caught onto something
 I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
 
 Were you just kidding?
 'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
 We almost never speak
 I don't feel welcome anymore
 Baby what happened? Please tell me
 
 'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door
 
 And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
 And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
 And you flashback to when he said forever and always
 Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 
 Was I out of line?
 Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
 Like a scared little boy
 I looked into your eyes
 Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
 
 So here's to everything coming down to nothing
 Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core
 Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
 
 And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
 And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
 And you flashback to when he said forever and always
 Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 
 You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so
 
 Oh back up, baby, back up
 Did you forget everything?
 Back up, baby, back up
 Did you forget everything?
 
 'Cause it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 
 Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
 And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
 And you flashback to when we said forever and always
 
 And it rains in your bedroom
 Everything is wrong
 It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
 You didn't mean it baby,
 You said forever and always, yeah.

 You didn't mean it baby,
 You said forever and always, yeah.
 
 I guess you really did it this time
 Left yourself in your warpath
 Lost your balance on a tightrope
 Lost your mind trying to get it back
 
 Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days 
 Always a bigger bed to crawl into
 Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything 
 And everybody believed in you
 
 CHORUS:
 It's alright just wait and see
 Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
 Who you are is not what you've been
 You're still an innocent
 You're still an innocent
 
 But some things you can't speak of 
 But tonight you live it all again
 You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now 
 If only you had seen what you know now then
 Wasn't it easier in your firefly catching days
 When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
 Wasn't it beautiful running wild till you fell asleep
 Before the monsters caught up to you
 
 CHORUS:
 It's alright just wait and see
 Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh 
 Who you are is not what you've been
 You're still an innocent
 
 It's okay life is a tough crowd
 32 and still growing up now
 Who you are is not what you did
 You're still an innocent
 
 BRIDGE:
 Time turns flames to embers
 You'll have new Septembers
 Every one of us has messed up too
 Lives change like the weather
 I hope you remember
 Today is never too late to be brand new
 
 CHORUS:
 It's alright just wait and see
 Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
 Who you are is not what you've been
 You're still an innocent
 
 It's okay life is a tough crowd
 32 and still growing up now
 Who you are is not what you did
 You're still an innocent
 You're still an innocent
 
 Lost your balance on a tightrope
 It's never too late to get it back
 
 No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
 
 He was the best of times, the worst of crimes
 I struck a match and blew your mind
 But I didn't mean it
 And you didn't see it
 The ties were black, the lies were white
 And shades of grey in candlelight
 I wanted to leave him
 I needed a reason
 
 X marks the spot, where we fell apart
 He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
 I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
 We never had a shotgun shot in the dark
 
 You were drivin' the getaway car
 We were flyin', but we'd never get far
 Don't pretend it's such a mystery
 Think about the place where you first met me
 We're ridin' in a getaway car
 There were sirens in the beat of your heart
 Should've known I'd be the first to leave
 Think about the place where you first met me
 
 In a getaway car, oh-oh
 No, they never get far, oh-ahh
 No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
 
 It was the great escape, the prison break
 The light of freedom on my face
 But you weren't thinkin'
 And I was just drinkin'
 While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', "go, go, go!"
 But with three of us, honey, it's a side show
 And a circus ain't a love story
 And now we're both sorry 
 
 X marks the spot, where we fell apart
 He poisoned the well, every man for himself
 I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
 It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart
 
 You were drivin' the getaway car
 We were flyin', but we'd never get far
 Don't pretend it's such a mystery
 Think about the place where you first met me
 We're ridin' in a getaway car
 There were sirens in the beat of your heart
 Should've known I'd be the first to leave
 Think about the place where you first met me
 
 In a getaway car, oh-oh
 No, they never get far, oh-ahh
 No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
 
 We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde
 Until I switched to the other side
 To the other si-i-i-i-ide
 It's no surprise I turned you in
 'Cause us traitors never win
 
 I'm in a getaway car
 I left you in a motel bar
 Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
 That was the last time you ever saw me
 
 Drivin' the getaway car
 We were flyin', but we'd never get far
 Don't pretend it's such a mystery
 Think about the place where you first met me
 We're ridin' in a getaway car
 There were sirens in the beat of your heart
 Should've known I'd be the first to leave
 Think about the place where you first met me
 
 In a getaway car, oh-oh
 No, they never get far, oh-ahh
 No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
 
 I was ridin' in a getaway car
 I was cryin' in a getaway car
 I was dyin' in a getaway car
 Said goodbye in a getaway car
 Ridin' in a getaway car
 I was cryin' in a getaway car
 I was dyin' in a getaway car
 Said goodbye in a getaway car
 
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that.
 
 I don't even know her,
 But I feel a responsibility,
 To do what's upstanding and right,
 It's kinda like a code, yeah,
 And you've been getting closer and closer,
 And crossing so many lines.
 
 And it would be a fine proposition,
 If I was a stupid girl,
 But honey I am no-one's exception,
 This I have previously learned.
 
 So don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Ah ah, don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 I see you turn off your phone,
 And now you got me alone,
 And I say, don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that.
 
 I just wanna make sure,
 You understand perfectly,
 You're the kind of man who makes me sad,
 While she waits up,
 You chase down the newest thing,
 And take for granted what you have.
 
 And it would be a fine proposition,
 If I was a stupid girl,
 And yeah I might go with it,
 If I hadn't once been just like her.
 
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Ah ah, don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 I see you turn off your phone,
 And now you've got me alone,
 And I say, don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that.
 
 Call a cab,
 Lose my number,
 You're about to lose your girl,
 Call a cab,
 Lose my number,
 Let's consider this lesson learned.
 
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Ah ah, don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Wanna see you pick up your phone,
 And tell her you're coming home,
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that,
 Don't look at me,
 You've got a girl at home,
 And everybody knows that,
 Everybody knows that.
 
 It would be a fine proposition,
 If I hadn't once been just like her.
 
 You should take it as a compliment
 That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
 You should think about the consequence
 Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
 And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
 He's in the club doing, I don't know what
 You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much 
 
 Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
 You've ruined my life, by not being mine
 
 You're so gorgeous
 I can't say anything to your face
 'Cause look at your face
 And I'm so furious
 At you for making me feel this way
 But, what can I say?
 You're gorgeous
 
 You should take it as a compliment
 That I'm talking to everyone here but you 
 And you should think about the consequence
 Of you touching my hand in the darkened room 
 If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
 But if you're single that's honestly worse
 'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
 
 Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
 I feel like I might sink and drown and die
 
 You're so gorgeous
 I can't say anything to your face 
 'Cause look at your face 
 And I'm so furious
 At you for making me feel this way
 But what can I say?
 You're gorgeous
 
 You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
 There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
 You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
 You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
 There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
 Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
 Alone, unless you wanna come along, oh
 
 You're so gorgeous
 I can't say anything to your face 
 'Cause look at your face 
 And I'm so furious 
 At you for making me feel this way 
 But what can I say? 
 You're gorgeous
 
 You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
 There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
 You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
 You're gorgeous
 You make me so happy, it turns back to sad, yeah
 There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
 You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
 You're gorgeous
 
 My name's Gracie
 I'll be five in May
 Kinda scared 'cause
 I've never been on a plane
 
 My mama says that it'll be alright
 'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight
 And she says that
 
 There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
 An' I don't wanna get there too soon
 And I know there's a God because I met him
 And I see it when I'm looking at you
 There ain't no accidents in what we do
 
 My name's Heather
 Guess we're on the same flight
 Don't mind Gracie
 She could talk to you all night
 
 She's finally well enough to travel
 Doctor says she's in the clear
 She's been in and out of hospital
 Since the beginning of the year
 
 And there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
 But none of us want to get there too soon
 And I know there's a God because I met him
 And I see it when I'm looking at you
 There ain't no accidents in what we do
 
 James T. Johnson
 That's her daddy's name
 He's been overseas
 It'll be a year today
 
 He never talked about being scared over the phone
 He just said me and Gracie will come and take him home
 
 There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven
 And I don't wanna get there too soon
 And I know there's a God because I met him
 And I see it when I'm looking at you
 There ain't no accidents in what we do
 
 And the people that we meet
 As we go through the rain
 There are no accidents in what we do
 
 You and I walk a fragile line
 I have known it all this time
 But I never thought I'd live to see it break
 It's getting dark and its all too quiet
 And I can't trust anything now
 And its comin' over you like its all a big mistake
 
 Holding my breath, won't lose you again
 Something's made your eyes go cold
 
 Come on, come on don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
 Come on, come on don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Can't breathe whenever you're gone
 Can't turn back, now I'm haunted
 
 Stood there and watched you walk away
 From everything we had
 But I still mean every word I said to you
 He will try to take away my pain
 And he just might make me smile
 But the whole time I'm wishin' he was you instead
 Oh, oh, holding my breath, won't see you again
 Something keeps me holding on to nothing
 
 Come on, come on don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Something's gone terribly wrong, you're all I wanted
 Come on, come on don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Can't breathe whenever you're gone
 Can't turn back, now I'm haunted
 
 I know, I know, I just know
 You're not gone, you can't be gone
 No
 
 Come on, come on don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Something's gone terribly wrong, won't finish what you started
 Come on, come on don't leave me like this
 I thought I had you figured out
 Can't breathe whenever you're gone
 Can't go back, I'm haunted
 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 You and I walk a fragile line
 I have known it all this time
 Never ever thought I'd see it break
 Never thought I'd see it
 
 Here you come again
 Just when I've begun
 To get myself together
 You waltz right in the door
 Just like you've done before
 And wrap my heart
 Around your little finger
 Here you come again
 Just when I'm about
 To make it work without you
 
 You look into my eyes
 And light those dreamy eyes
 And pretty soon I'm wondering
 How I came to doubt you
 All you got to do
 Is smile that smile
 And there go all my defenses
 Just leave it up to you
 And in a little while
 You're messing up my mind
 And filling up my senses
 
 Here you come again
 Looking better than a body
 Has a right to
 And shaking me up so
 That all I really know
 Is here you come again
 
 All you got to do
 Is smile that smile
 And there go all my defenses
 Just leave it up to you
 And in a little while
 You're messing up my mind
 And filling up my senses
 
 Here you come again
 Looking better than a body
 Has a right to
 And shaking me up so
 That all I really know
 Is here you come again
 Here I go
 And here you come again
 
 Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
 But I know I saw a light in you
 And as we walked we would talk
 And I didn't say half the things I wanted to
 Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
 I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
 Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believing
 I don't always have to be alone
 
 'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mmm I can't help myself
 
 Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
 So I've got some things to say to you
 I've seen it all, so I thought
 But I've never seen nobody shine the way you do
 The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
 It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
 Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving
 I think you and I should stay the same
 
 Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mmm I can't help myself
 
 They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
 Why aren't you here tonight?
 I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out
 And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
 
 Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
 Why I should be the one you choose
 All those other girls, well they're beautiful
 But would they write a song for you?
 
 Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 
 I can't help myself if you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mmm I can't help myself
 myself
 Mm
 I can't help myself
 I can't help myself
 Oh, Oh,
 Mm
 Mm
 
 I was reminiscing just the other day
 While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
 Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time
 Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
 Took off faster than a green light "Go"
 Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know
 I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
 And that was the first day
 
 And darling, it was good never looking down
 And right there where we stood was holy ground
 
 Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
 We had this big wide city all to ourselves
 We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you'
 And for the first time I had something to lose
 And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
 And the story's got dust on every page
 But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
 And I see your face in every crowd
 
 Cause darling, it was good never looking down
 And right there where we stood was holy ground
 
 Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
 Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
 
 It was good never looking down
 And right there where we stood was holy ground
 
 Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
 Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
 
 I think of you every single evening 
 As I lay awake at night
 I try to think; try to walk away with you
 And I say:
 
 Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
 Say that everything will be fine
 Oh, honey baby, oh
 How can you blame me
 When I say I want to make you mine?
 Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy 
 Except you, honey baby
 Oh!
 
 Flying high, I can see his smiling 
 As we walk down by the drives
 Take my hand, take my breath away
 Because you make me feel like flying
 
 Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
 Say that everything will be fine
 Oh, honey baby, oh
 How can you blame me
 When I say I want to make you mine?
 Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
 Except you, honey baby
 Oh!
 
 Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
 Oh, you are everything I want to be
 Drive me crazy, have me, baby
 All I really want to say is:
 
 Honey baby, don't do anything crazy around us
 Say that everything will be fine
 Oh, honey baby, oh
 How can you blame me
 When I say I want to make you mine?
 Because everybody else in the world is driving me crazy 
 Oh, except you, honey baby
 
 Guess mine is not the first heart broken
 My eyes are not the first to cry
 I'm not the first to know
 There's just no getting over you
 Hello, I'm just a fool 
 Who's willing to sit around and wait for you
 But baby, can't you see
 There's nothing else for me to do 
 I'm hopelessly devoted to you
 But now there's nowhere to hide
 Since you pushed my love aside 
 I'm not in my head
 Hopelessly devoted to you
 Hopelessly devoted to you
 Hopelessly devoted to you
 
 My head is saying, "Fool, forget him"
 My heart is saying, "Don't let go"
 Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
 I'm hopelessly devoted to you
 But now there's nowhere to hide
 Since you pushed my love aside 
 I'm not in my head
 Hopelessly devoted to you
 Hopelessly devoted to you
 Hopelessly devoted to you
 
 Stand there like a ghost
 Shaking come the rain, rain
 She'll open up the door
 And say, are you insane, -ane?
 
 Say it's been a long six months 
 And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want 
 
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl
 
 And then you say
 I want you for worse or for better
 I would wait for ever and ever
 Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
 I would wait for ever and ever
 
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl
 
 Remind her how it used to be, be
 Yeah, with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
 Tell her how you must've lost your mind 
 When you left her all alone and never told her why, why 
 
 And that's how it works
 That's how you lost the girl
 
 And now you say
 I want you for worse or for better
 I would wait for ever and ever 
 Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
 I would wait for ever and ever
 
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl, yeah
 
 And you could know, oh
 That I don't want you to go
 
 Remind me how it used to be
 Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
 And say you want me, yeah, yeah
 
 And then you say I want you for worse or for better 
 I would wait for ever and ever 
 Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
 I would wait for ever and ever 
 
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
  And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl, oh 
 
  And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
 And that's how it works
 It's how you get the girl, girl, oh
 
 And that's how it works
 That's how you got the girl
 
 I bet this time of night you're still up.
 I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
 I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
 And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.
 
 And I just wanna tell you
 It takes everything in me not to call you.
 And I wish I could run to you.
 And I hope you know that every time I don't
 I almost do,
 I almost do.
 
 I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
 'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
 I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
 And risk another goodbye.
 
 And I just wanna tell you
 It takes everything in me not to call you.
 And I wish I could run to you.
 And I hope you know that every time I don't
 I almost do,
 I almost do.
 
 Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
 It's probably better off this way.
 And I confess babe,
 In my dreams you're touching my face
 And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
 And I almost do.
 
 And I just wanna tell you
 It takes everything in me, not to call you.
 And I wish I could run to you.
 And I hope you know that every time I don't
 I almost do,
 I almost do.
 
 I bet this time of night you're still up.
 I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
 I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
 And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.
 
 I never trust a narcissist
 But they love me
 So I play 'em like a violin
 And I make it look oh so easy
 'Cause for every lie I tell them
 They tell me three
 This is how the world works
 Now all he thinks about is me
 
 I can feel the flames on my skin
 Crimson red paint on my lips
 If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
 I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming
 
 They say I did something bad
 Then why's it feel so good?
 They say I did something bad
 But why's it feel so good?
 Most fun I ever had
 And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
 It just felt so good, good
 
 I never trust a playboy
 But they love me
 So I fly him all around the world
 And I let them think they saved me
 They never see it comin'
 What I do next
 This is how the world works
 You gotta leave before you get left
 
 I can feel the flames on my skin
 He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
 But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
 And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'
 
 They say I did something bad
 Then why's it feel so good?
 They say I did something bad
 But why's it feel so good?
 Most fun I ever had
 And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
 It just felt so good, good
 
 It just felt so good
 
 They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
 They got their pitchforks and proof
 Their receipts and reasons
 They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
 So light me up , light me up 
 Light me up, go ahead and light me up 
 Light me up , light me up 
 Light me up , light me up 
 
 They say I did something bad
 Then why's it feel so good?
 They say I did something bad
 But why's it feel so good?
 Most fun I ever had
 And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
 It just felt so good, good
 
 Oh, you say I did something bad
 Then why's it feel so good, good?
 So bad, why's it feel so good?
 Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? 
 It just felt so good, good
 
 Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
 It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all
 
 Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
 Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
 What is happening to me?
 
 I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
 And I don't wanna fit wherever
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 
 I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
 Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life, oh
 
 Baby, baby, I feel crazy
 Up all night, all night and every day
 I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
 What is happening to me?
 
 I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
 And I don't wanna fit  wherever 
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 
 I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
 Baby, baby, I feel crazy
 I see you around in all these empty faces
 Up all night, all night and every day
 I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
 Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
 Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
 What is happening to me?
 
 I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
 And I don't wanna fit wherever
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 
 I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
 Until you come back home
 
 Wish I had concentrated,
 They said love was complicated,
 But it's something I just fell into.
 And it was overrated,
 But just look what I created,
 I came out alive, but I'm black and blue.
 Before you ask me if I'm alright,
 Think about what I,
 Had to do, yeah
 
 Wake up and smell the break up,
 Fix my heart, put on my make-up,
 Another mess I didn't plan.
 And I'll bet you thought you beat me,
 Wish you could only see,
 I got an "I Heart question mark"
 Written on the back of my hand!
 
 I'd be fine if you'd just walked by,
 But you had to talk about why
 You were wrong and I was right.
 But I can't believe you made me,
 Sit at home and cry like a baby,
 Wait right by the phone every night.
 And now you ask about you and I,
 There's no you and I,
 Remember what you put me through,
 I had to
 
 Wake up and smell the break up,
 Fix my heart, put on my make-up,
 Another mess I didn't plan.
 And I'll bet you thought you beat me,
 Wish you could only see
 I got an "I Heart question mark"
 Written on the back of my hand!
 
 And when you're home all alone at night,
 You'll still wonder why
 You took everything I had, oh baby.
 I haven't thought about you and I,
 There's no you and I, and I know
 Someday you will
 
 Wake up and smell the break up,
 Realize that we won't make up,
 It didn't go the way you planned.
 And you'll know you didn't beat me
 When you look down and see
 I got an "I Heart question mark"
 Written on the back of my hand!
 
 Written on the back of my hand!
 An "I Heart question mark", yeah.
 Written on the back of my hand!
 
 Once upon time
 A few mistakes ago
 I was in your sights
 You got me alone
 You found me
 You found me
 You found me
 
 I guess you didn't care
 And I guess I liked that
 And when I fell hard
 You took a step back
 Without me, without me, without me
 
 And he's long gone
 When he's next to me
 And I realize the blame is on me
 
 'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 So you put me down oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 No apologies
 He'll never see you cry
 Pretend he doesn't know
 That he's the reason why
 You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
 
 And I heard you moved on
 From whispers on the street
 A new notch in your belt
 Is all I'll ever be
 And now I see, now I see, now I see
 He was long gone
 When he met me
 And I realize the joke is on me
 
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 So you put me down oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 When your saddest fear comes creeping in
 That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
 Yeah
 
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 So you put me down oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 Trouble, trouble, trouble
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 Trouble, trouble, trouble
 
 I I I I, I I I I
 I I I I, I I I I
 I I I I, I I I I, I I
 
 You stand with a hand on my waist line 
 Good to see that we're out in blank side 
 I can hear them whisper as we pass by 
 It's a bad sign, bad sign 
 Something happens when everybody finds out 
 See the vulture circling in dark cloud 
 Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out 
 It could burn out 
 'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes 
 And guns, they are the hunters, we are the foxes 
 And we run
 
 Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
 Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
 'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
 I know places
 
 Lights flash on the run for the fences 
 Let them say what they want, we won't hear it 
 Lose sleep, swing ship, all the damn time, not this time 
 Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it 
 My love, they are the hunters, we are the foxes 
 And we run
 
 Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
 Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
 'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
 They are the hunters, we are the foxes
 And we run
 Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
 My love
 
 Baby I know places we won't be found and they'll be
 Chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
 'Cause I, I know places we can hide, I know places
 
  They take their shots, we're bulletproof
 I know places
  And you know for me it's always you
 I know places
  In the dead of night, you act so great
 I know places
  And I know for you it's always me
 I know places
 
 Ooh baby give me one more chance
 
 Won't you please let me 
 Ooh darling I was blind to let you go
 
 Now that I see you in her arms
 
 I want you back
 Ooh baby
 I want you back
 
 Ooh
 Oh baby give me one more chance
 
 Won't you please let me 
 Oh darling I was blind to let you go
 
 Now that I see you in her arms
 I want you back
 
 Ooh baby
 
 It's 2 A.M. in your car
 Windows down, I pass my street
 The memories start
 
 You say it's in the past
 And drive straight ahead
 You think I'm gonna hate you now
 'Cause you still don't know what I never said
 
 I wish you would come back
 Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
 I wish you knew that
 I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
 
 And I wish you were right here, right now
 It's all good
 I wish you would
 
 It's 2 A.M. in my room
 Headlights pass the window pane
 I think of you
 
 We're a crooked love
 In a straight line down
 Makes you wanna run and hide
 Then it makes you turn right back around
 
 I wish you would come back
 Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
 I wish you knew that
 I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
 
 And I wish you were right here, right now
 It's all good
 I wish you would
 
 I wish we could go back
 And remember what we were fighting for
 Wish you knew that
 I miss you too much to be mad anymore
 
 And I wish you were right here, right now
 It's all good
 I wish you would
 
 I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
 I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
 I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
 
 You always knew how to push my buttons 
 You gave me everything and nothing 
 This mad, mad love makes you come rushing 
 Stand back where you stood 
 I wish you would, I wish you would 
 
 I wish you would, I wish you would 
  
 
 2 A.M., here we are
 See your face
 Hear my voice in the dark
 
 We're a crooked love
 In a straight line down
 Guess you wanna run and hide
 But it made us turn right back around
 
 I wish you would come back
 Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
 I wish you knew that
 I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
 
 And I wish you were right here, right now
 It's all good
 I wish you would
 
 I wish you would come back
 Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
 I wish you knew that
 I'd never forget you as long as I'd live
 
 And I wish you were right here, right now
 It's all good
 I wish you would
 
 I wish we could go back
 And remember what we were fighting for
 Wish you knew that
 I miss you too much to be mad anymore
 
 And I wish you were right here, right now
 It's all good
 I wish you would
 
 You always knew how to push my buttons 
 You gave me everything and nothing 
 This mad, mad love makes you come rushing 
 Stand back where you stood 
 I wish you would, I wish you would 
 
 I wish you would, I wish you would 
 
 I wish you would, I wish you would 
  
 
 I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I
 I I I I, I I I wish, I wish, I 
 
 Throwing pennies at the fountain
 But when you're standing on the mountain
 It's kind of hard to aim
 Like the tree we cut our names in
 There must be an explanation
 Guess it didn't get enough rain
 I need reasons why you're leaving
 
 Well I guess I wished on a plane, I thought it was a star
 I guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart
 Because I swore when you said that you loved me
 Guess I heard you wrong
 
 And I guess I wished on a plane, and I thought it was a star
 
 I don't think that passenger seat
 Has ever looked this good to me
 He tells me about his night
 And I count the colors in his eyes
 
 He'd never fall in love
 He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair
 I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
 And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
 He tells a joke, I fake a smile
 That I know all his favorite songs
 
 And I could tell you
 His favorite color's green
 He loves to argue
 Born on the seventeenth
 His sister's beautiful
 He has his father's eyes
 And if you ask me if I love him..
 I'd lie
 
 He looks around the room
 Innocently overlooks the truth
 Shouldn't a light go on
 Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long
 
 He sees everything in black and white
 Never let nobody see him cry
 I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine
 
 I could tell you
 His favorite color's green
 He loves to argue
 Born on the seventeenth
 His sister's beautiful
 He has his father's eyes
 And if you ask me if I love him..
 I'd lie
 
 He stands there, then walks away
 My God, if I could only say
 I'm holding every breath for you
 
 He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
 I think he can see through everything but my heart
 First thought when I wake up is
 My God, he's beautiful
 So I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle
 
 Yes I could tell you
 His favorite color's green
 He loves to argue
 Oh, and it kills me
 His sister's beautiful
 He has his father's eyes
 And if you ask me if I love him..
 If you ask me if I love him..
 I'd lie
 
 I'm every women, it's all in me 
 Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
 I'm every women, it's all in me  
 I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
 Oh, oh, oh.
 
 I can cast a spell with secrets you can't tell
 Mix a special brew, but fire inside of you
 But anytime you feel danger or fear
 Instantly I will appear 'cause
 
 I'm every women, it's all in me 
 Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
 I'm every women, it's all in me  
 I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
 Oh, oh, oh.
 
 I can sense your needs like rain onto the seeds
 I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
 And when it comes down to good old fashion love
 I've got it, I've got it, I've got it yeah-ah-ah!
 
 I'm every women, it's all in me 
 Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
 I'm every women, it's all in me  
 I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z.
 
 I'm every women, it's all in me 
 Anything you want done, baby I'll do it naturally
 
 I'm every women, it's all in me  
 I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z.
 
 Friday night beneath the stars
 In a field behind your yard
 You and I are painting pictures in the sky
 Sometimes we don't say a thing
 Just listen to the crickets sing
 Everything I need is right here by my side
 
 And I know everything about you
 I don't wanna live without you
 
 I'm only up when you're not down
 Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
 It's like no matter what I do
 Well, you drive me crazy half the time
 The other half I'm only trying
 To let you know that what I feel is true
 And I'm only me when I'm with you
 
 Just a small-town boy and girl
 Living in the crazy world
 Trying to figure out what is and isn't true
 And I don't try to hide my tears
 My secrets or my deepest fears
 Through it all nobody gets me like you do
 
 And you know everything about me
 You say that you can't live without me
 
 I'm only up when you're not down
 Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
 It's like no matter what I do
 Well, you drive me crazy half the time
 The other half I'm only trying
 To let you know that what I feel is true
 And I'm only me when I'm with you
 
 When I'm with anybody else
 It's so hard to be myself
 And only you can tell
 
 I'm only up when you're not down
 Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
 It's like no matter what I do
 Well, you drive me crazy half the time
 The other half I'm only trying
 To let you know that what I feel is true
 And I'm only me when I'm with you
 
 Last night I heard my own heart beating
 Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
 Six months gone and I'm still reaching
 Even though I know you're not there
 I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
 Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
 Maybe I've been going back too much lately
 When time stood still and I had you
 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You would, you would if this was a movie
 Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
 I know that we could work it out somehow
 But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
 
 I know people change and these things happen
 But I remember how it was back then
 Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
 'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
 Now I'm pacing up the hall, chasing down your street
 Flashback to a night when you said to me,
 "Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
 Not before I knew how much I had to lose"
 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You would, you would if this was a movie
 Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
 I know that we could work it out somehow
 But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
 
 If you're out there
 If you're somewhere
 If you're moving on
 I'll be waiting for you
 Wary, since you've been gone
 I just want it back the way it was before
 And I just want to see you back at my front door
 And I say
 
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You would before you say it's not that easy
 Before the fight, before I locked you out
 But I take it all back now
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You would, you would if this was a movie
 Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
 Come back, come back, come back to me like
 You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
 I know that we could work it out somehow
 But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
 
 You'd be here by now
 It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
 Baby, I don't like the ending
 Oh, I thought you'd be here now, whoa
 Thought you'd be here by now
 
 I guess you really did it this time
 Left yourself in your warpath
 Lost your balance on a tightrope
 Lost your mind tryin' to get it back
 
 Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
 Always a bigger bed to crawl into
 Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
 And everybody believed in you?
 
 It's alright, just wait and see
 Your string of lights is still bright to me
 Oh, who you are is not where you've been
 You're still an innocent
 You're still an innocent
 
 Did some things you can't speak of
 But at night you'll live it all again
 You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
 If only you had seen what you know now then
 
 Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
 And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
 Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?
 Before the monsters caught up to you?
 
 It's alright, just wait and see
 Your string of lights is still bright to me
 Oh, who you are is not where you've been
 You're still an innocent
 
 It's okay, life is a tough crowd
 Thirty two and still growin' up now
 Who you are is not what you did
 You're still an innocent
 
 Time turns flames to embers
 You'll have new Septembers
 Every one of us has messed up too
 
 Lives change like the weather
 I hope you remember
 Today is never too late to
 Be brand new
 
 It's all right, just wait and see
 Your string of lights are still bright to me
 Oh, who you are is not where you've been
 You're still an innocent
 
 It's okay, life is a tough crowd
 Thirty two and still growin' up now
 Who you are is not what you did
 You're still an innocent
 You're still an innocent
 
 Lost your balance on a tight rope, oh
 It's never too late to get it back
 
 She can't see the way your eyes
 Light up when you smile
 She'll never notice how you stop and stare
 Whenever she walks by
 And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
 But you are everything to me
 
 And I just wanna show you
 She don't even know you
 She's never gonna love you like I want to
 And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
 We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
 Instead of just invisible
 
 There's a fire inside of you
 That can't help but shine through
 She's never gonna see the light
 No matter what you do
 And all I think about is how to make you think of me
 And everything that we could be
 
 And I just wanna show you
 She don't even know you
 She's never gonna love you like I want to
 And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
 We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable
 Instead of just invisible
 
 Like shadows in a faded light
 Oh we're invisible
 I just wanna open your eyes
 And make you realize
 
 I just want to show you, she don't even know you,
 Baby let me love you, let me want you".
 
 She can't see the way your eyes
 Light up when you smile
 
 :
 We can step it up just a little bit of a notch. We can step it up I think. And I want you to sing along to every song that I sing that you know, please. As loud as you possibly can, I will not get offended. I think one of the cool things about being able to play guitar is that you can play whatever you want. And uh, you can play songs that you wrote or you can play songs that other people wrote or you can play country songs or you can play, you can play this.
 
 To the left
 To the left
 Everything you own 
 In the box to the left
 In the closet
 That's my stuff
 Yes, if I bought it
 Please don't touch
 
 Keep talking and yes that's fine
 Could you walk and talk 
 At the same time and
 It's my name thats on the tag
 Come in with your bags
 Let me call you a cab
 Standing in the front yard
 Telling me how I'm such a fool
 How I'm never going to find a man 
 Like you
 Got me twisted
 
 You must not know about me
 You must not know about me
 I can have another you
 In a minute
 Matter of fact
 He'll be here in a minute 
 Baby
 You must not know about me
 You must not know about me
 I can have another you by tomorrow
 So don't you
 Ever for a second get to thinking
 
 You're irreplaceable
 
 So
 Go ahead and get gone
 Call up that chick
 And see if she's home
 Oops, I bet you thought
 That I didn't know
 What'd you think 
 I was putting you out for
 Because you were untrue
 Hauling her around in the truck
 That I bought you
 Baby, drop them keys
 Hurry up before your taxi leaves
 
 Standing in the front yard
 Telling me how I'm such a fool
 Talking about
 How I'll never find a man like you
 Got me twisted
 
 You must not know about me
 You must not know about me
 I can have another you in a minute
 Matter of fact
 He'll be here in a minute
 Baby
 You must not know about me
 You must not know about me
 I can have another you by tomorrow
 So don't you ever for a second
 Get to thinking
 You're irreplacable
 Yeah
 
 I like the way you sound in the morning,
 We're on the phone and without a warning
 I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard
 
 I like the way I can't keep my focus,
 I watch you talk you didn't notice
 I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together
 
 Every time you smile, I smile
 And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
 
 Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
 Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me
 
 Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
 Say that you wanna be with me too
 Cuz I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall
 
 Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
 You got the keys to me I love each freckle on your face, oh,
 I've never been so wrapped up,
 Honey, I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted
 
 I had time to think it all over and all I can say is come closer,
 Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
 
 Every time you smile, I smile
 And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
 
 Whoa oh I'm feeling you baby
 Don't be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me
 
 Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
 Say that you wanna be with me too
 I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall
 
 The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
 I'll catch you, I'll catch you
 When people say things that bring you to your knees,
 I'll catch you
 The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
 But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
 
 Whoa oh I need you baby
 Don't be afraid please
 Jump then fall, jump then fall into me
 
 Baby, I'm never gonna leave you,
 Say that you wanna be with me too
 I'ma stay through it all so jump then fall
 
 Jump then fall baby
 Jump then fall into me, into me
 
 Every time you smile, I smile
 And every time you shine, I'll shine
 And every time you're here baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
 You can jump then fall, jump then fall, jump then fall 
 Into me, into me yeah
 
 She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
 She didn't have a reason to stay
 Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
 She looked at her keys and found a reason to run
 
 And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound
 But I understand it somehow
 
 If I could drive all night 
 Would I find my peace of mind
 Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
 An unfamiliar exit sign
 If I just drive on by
 Just south of knowing why
 
 I didn't really know her that well 
 But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind. 
 She felt so out of touch, just felt too much
 If you don't know what you want, nothing's ever enough
 
 And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound
 That's where I'm headed right now
 
 If I could drive all night 
 Would I find my peace of mind
 Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
 An unfamiliar exit sign
 If I just drive on by 
 Just south of knowing why
 
 I don't have a plan
 I don't have a map
 I don't even know if I'm ever going back
 I don't have a when
 And I don't have a where
 I don't even know if I'm knowing I'm there
 
 And time stands still, when you're nowhere bound
 But I understand it somehow
 
 But If I could drive all night 
 Would I find my peace of mind
 Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
 An unfamiliar exit sign
 If I just drive on by
 Just south of knowing why
 
 I just drive on by
 Drive on
 Drive on
 Drive all night
 
 If I drive on
 Drive on
 Drive on
 Drive all night
 Just south of knowing why
 
 I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
 I made up on my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
 We met a few weeks ago
 Now you try on callin' me, baby, like tryin' on clothes
 
 So prove to me I'm your American Queen
 And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
 And we rule the kingdom inside my room
 'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
 With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
 Never took me quite where you do
 
 And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
 King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
 And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
 King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
 
 And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
 Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
 And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
 Body and soul, ooh whoa
 And all at once
 
 Late in the night, the city's asleep
 Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
 Change my priorities
 The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury
 
 So prove to me I'm your American Queen
 And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
 And we rule the kingdom inside my room
 'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
 With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
 Never took me quite where you do
 
 And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
 King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
 And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
 King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
 
 And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
 Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
 And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
 Body and soul, ooh whoa
 And all at once
 
 Is the end of all the endings?
 My broken bones are mending
 With all these nights we're spending
 Up on the roof with a school girl crush
 Drinking beer out of plastic cups
 Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
 Baby, all at once, this is enough
 
 And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
 King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
 And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
 King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
 And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
 King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
 
 And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
 Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
 And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting, waiting
 Body and soul, ooh whoa
 And all at once
 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 Once bitten and twice shy
 I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
 Tell me baby
 Do you recognize me
 Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
 Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
 With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
 Now I know what a fool I've been
 But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again
 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
 I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
 My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
 Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
 A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
 A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
 Maybe this year
 Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special
 
 'Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 And last Christmas
 And this year
 It won't be anything like, anything like
 
 Last Christmas I gave you my heart
 But the very next day, you gave it away
 This year, to save me from tears
 I'll give it to someone special
 
 I still remember the look on your face
 Lit through the darkness at 1:58
 The words that you whispered
 For just us to know
 You told me you loved me
 So why did you go
 Away
 Away
 
 I do recall now
 The smell of the rain
 Fresh on the pavement
 I ran off the plane
 That July ninth
 The beat of your heart
 It jumps through your shirt
 I can still feel your arms
 
 But now I'll go sit on the floor
 Wearing your clothes
 All that I know is
 I don't know how to be something you missed
 Never thought we'd have a last kiss
 Never imagined we'd end like this
 Your name, forever the name on my lips
 
 I do remember
 The swing in your step
 The life of the party, you're showing off again
 And I roll my eyes and then
 You pull me in
 I'm not much for dancing
 But for you I did
 
 Because I love your handshake
 Meetin' my father
 I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
 How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
 There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
 
 And I'll go sit on the floor
 Wearing your clothes
 All that I know is that
 I don't know how to be something you miss
 Never thought we'd have a last kiss
 Never imagined we'd end like this
 Your name, forever the name on my lips
 
 So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
 And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
 And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
 Hope it's nice where you are
 
 And I hope the sun shines
 And it's a beautiful day
 And something reminds you
 You wish you had stayed
 You can plan for a change in weather and time
 But I never planned on you changing your mind
 
 So I'll go sit on the floor
 Wearing your clothes
 All that I know is that
 I don't know how to be something you miss
 Never thought we'd have a last kiss
 Never imagined we'd end like this
 Your name, forever the name on my lips
 
 Just like our last kiss
 Forever the name on my lips
 Forever the name on my lips
 Just like our last
 
 One daybreak, one heartache, every once upon a time
 That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines
 They mean so much to everyone 
 But you count them up one by one
 Clear midnights and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
 A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
 Your black boots, my red flower ring
 They're for the little things
 
 Oil paintings and make it, every detail turned out bad
 One night stands, new romance, living for that love and person
 It means so much to everyone
 But you count them up one by one
 Clear midnights and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
 
 A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
 Your black boots, my red flower ring
 They're for the little things, oh, yeah 
 
 No fighting, black riding, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
 Pretending, defending, take a risk and go a thought for the right
 Strawberries and fairies with wings
 They're for the little things
 Na na na, na na na, na na na na, uh yeah
 Na na na, na na na, na na na na, oh yeah
 
 I said remember this moment
 In the back of my mind
 The time we stood with our shaking hands
 The crowds in stands went wild
 We were the kings and the queens
 And they read off our names
 The night you danced like you knew our lives
 Would never be the same
 You held your head like a hero
 On a history book page
 It was the end of a decade
 But the start of an age
 
 Long live the walls we crashed through
 All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
 And bring on all the pretenders
 One day we will be remembered
 
 I said remember this feeling
 I passed the pictures around
 Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
 Wishing for right now
 We are the kings and the queens
 You traded your baseball cap for a crown
 When they gave us our trophies
 And we held them up for our town
 And the cynics were outraged
 Screaming, "this is absurd"
 'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world
 
 Long live the walls we crashed through
 All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
 And bring on all the pretenders
 I'm not afraid
 
 Long live all the mountains we moved
 I had the time of my life
 Fighting dragons with you
 I was screaming, "long live the look on your face"
 And bring on all the pretenders
 One day we will be remembered
 
 Hold on to spinning around
 Confetti falls to the ground
 May these memories break our fall
 
 Can you take a moment
 Promise me this:
 That you'll stand by me forever
 But if God forbid fate should step in
 And force us into a goodbye
 If you have children someday
 When they point to the pictures
 Please tell them my name
 Tell them how the crowds went wild
 Tell them how I hope they shine
 
 Long live the walls we crashed through
 I had the time of my life with you
 
 Long, long live the walls we crashed through
 All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 And I was screaming, "long live all the magic we made"
 And bring on all the pretenders
 I'm not afraid
 
 Singing long live all the mountains we moved
 I had the time of my life
 Fighting dragons with you
 And long, long live the look on your face
 And bring on all the pretenders
 One day, we will be remembered
 
 I've got a lying smile, I never put out for you
 'Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
 And they say little girls have big dreams
 And nothing in the word was gonna come between me and you
 
 And it was a long time coming
 I waited half my life just to find someone like you
 I spent a long time finding out
 Love hangs around after you walk out
 Not knowing, it'd be a long time going
 
 They say it's better to have lost, than never to have loved at all
 And I say whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
 And they say little girls are so naive 
 That wasn't how it was supposed to be, with me and you
 
 And it was a long time coming,
 I waited half my life just to find someone like you
 I spent a long time finding out
 Love hangs around after you walk out
 Not knowing, it'd be a long time going
 
 I burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
 Washed my sins on the neon lights
 And I'm still not over you
 
 And it was a long time coming,
 I waited half my life just to find someone like you
 I spent a long time finding out,
 Love hangs around after you walk out
 Not knowing, it'd be a long time going
 A long time going
 And it would be a long time, long time going
 It would be a long time, long time going
 
 I don't like your little games
 Don't like your tilted stage
 The role you made me play
 Of the fool, no, I don't like you
 I don't like your perfect crime
 How you laugh when you lie
 You said the gun was mine
 Isn't cool, no, I don't like you 
 
 But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
 Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
 I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
 I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
 
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 
 I don't like your kingdom keys
 They once belonged to me
 You ask me for a place to sleep
 Locked me out and threw a feast 
 The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
 But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
 And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure 
 Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
 
 But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time

 I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
 I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

 I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
 I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
 I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
 I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
 I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
 
 "I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now" 
 "Why?" 
 "Oh, 'cause she's dead!" 
 
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do

 Look what you just made me do
 
 We were both young when I first saw you
 I close my eyes and the flashback starts
 I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
 
 See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
 See you make your way through the crowd
 And say hello
 
 Little did I know
 That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
 And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
 And I was crying on the staircase
 Begging you, please, don't go
 
 And I said,
 "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
 I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
 You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
 It's a love story, baby just say yes
 
 So I sneak out to the garden to see you
 We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
 So close your eyes, escape this town for a little while
 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
 And my daddy said "Stay away from Juliet"
 But you were everything to me, I was begging you, please, don't go
 
 And I said Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
 I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
 You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
 It's a love story baby just say yes
 
 Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
 This love is difficult, but it's real
 Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
 It's a love story, baby just say "Yes"
 
 Oh, oh
 
 I got tired of waiting
 Wondering if you were ever coming around
 My faith in you was fading
 When I met you on the outskirts of town
 
 And I said
 "Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
 I keep waiting for you but you never come
 Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
 
 He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
 "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
 I love you and that's all I really know
 I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
 It's a love story, baby just say yes"
 
 Oh, oh,
 Oh, oh
 
 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.
 
 There's a little girl in this little town 
 With a little too much heart to go around 
 Live forever, never say never 
 You can do better, that's what she says 
 
 Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night 
 A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
 The fact that she's different and yet she's the same 
 And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do do do 
 do do do do do do do do 
 Lucky you, lucky you 
 Do do do do do do do do 
 
 She sings her little song
 She walks a long a little 
 Pathway headed for the skies 
 Left her travels, lives they unravel 
 Mind over matter, that's what she says 
 
 Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night 
 A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite of
 And the fact that she's different and yet she's the same 
 And she says do do do do do do do do do do do do 
 do do do do do do do do do do do 
 Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you 
 do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do 
 
 Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
 Maybe she'll bring you up to the skies 
 Honey, she'll love you 
 Funny how some view 
 Angels above you ain't so far away.

 He's got a nice little life
 He's gonna live it, but on
 Friday nights he plays that mandolin
 Painted red, and he said
 It's not the best I know
 But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine
 
 People there can't help but care
 About the friendly music of a guy
 Who's getting by from their applause
 He's got a song that moves along
 He's got his local crowd tonight
 At Angelina's family bar and grill
 
 He's got his heart on his sleeve
 The songs he plays just living free
 But who knows what goes through his mind
 When he plays a song it brings along
 Everybody saying
 Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
 Oh yeah, mandolin
 
 Got a car, got a scar
 Like everyone he's got a few but
 Everybody loves that mandolin
 Got his problems, bills to pay
 Somehow that boy finds a way
 Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah
 
 He's got his heart on his sleeve
 The songs he plays just living free
 But who knows what goes through his mind
 When he plays a song it brings along
 Everybody saying
 Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
 Oh yeah, mandolin
 
 Oh he's the kind of guy
 Who never really wanted fame
 His feet are planted firmly on the ground
 He never wanted people to remember his name
 He never wanted word to get around
 That he found heaven on earth
 
 He's got his heart on his sleeve
 The songs he plays just living free
 But who knows what goes through his mind
 When he plays a song it brings along
 Everybody saying
 Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
 Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
 Mandolin
 Oh, mandolin
 
 She said
 "I was seven, and you were nine
 I looked at you like the stars that shined
 In the sky, the pretty lights."
 And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
 Growing up and fallin' in love
 And our mamas smiled, and rolled their eyes
 And said, "Oh, my, my, my"
 
 Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
 Said you'd beat me up; you were bigger than me
 You never did, you never did
 Take me back when our world was one block wide
 I dared you to kiss me, and ran when you tried
 Just two kids, you and I
 Oh, my, my, my, my
 
 Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
 I wasn't that little girl you used to see
 But your eyes still shined, like pretty lights
 And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
 They never believed we'd really fall in love
 And our mamas smiled, and rolled their eyes
 And said, "Oh, my, my, my"
 
 Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
 Two AM, ridin' in your truck
 And all I need is you next to me
 Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
 Slammin' of doors 'stead of kissin' goodnight
 You stayed outside till the morning light
 Oh, my, my, my, my
 
 A few years had gone and come around
 We were sittin' at our favorite spot in town
 And you looked at me, got down on one knee
 
 Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
 Our whole town came, and our mamas cried
 You said, "I do," and I did too
 Take me home where we met so many years before
 We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
 After all this time, you and I
 
 And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
 I'll still look at you like the stars that shine in the sky
 Oh, my, my, my
 
 I shined your shoes
 I poured the wine
 I gave you all of my time
 
 I patched your fake smile
 Against your friends
 Which apparently is a crime
 
 I gave you space
 You took my place
 And gave it to her
 
 But life's too long 
 To waste it all loving a liar
 
 And when love hands me matches now
 I'm going to burn it down
 
 I keyed her car
 Got my guitar
 And wrote this damn song
 
 Look what you've found
 She's been around
 I hear the line's long
 
 And don't you tell me 
 To be nice
 I'm not a nice girl
 
 She died from complications
 Of the things you told her
 
 So when love hands me matches now
 I'm going to burn it down
 
 Ain't it funny
 You said honey
 You meant sitting duck
 Well I say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
 Just a few I've thought of
 
 And when love hands me matches now
 Going to burn it down
 I'm going to burn it down
 Oh yeah
 Going to burn it, burn it, burn it down
 
 Matches, now
 
 You, with your words like knives
 And swords and weapons that you use against me
 You, have knocked me off my feet again,
 Got me feeling like a nothing
 You, with your voice like nails
 On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded
 You, picking on the weaker man
 
 You can take me down
 With just one single blow
 But you don't know what you don't know
 
 Someday I'll be living in a big old city
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Why you gotta be so mean?
 
 You, with your switching sides
 And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
 You have pointed out my flaws again
 As if I don't already see them
 I walk with my head down,
 Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you
 I just want to feel okay again
 
 I bet you got pushed around
 Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now
 'Cause you can't lead me down that road
 And you don't know what you don't know
 
 Someday I'll be living in a big old city
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Why you gotta be so mean?
 
 And I can see you years from now in a bar
 Talking over a football game
 With that same big loud opinion
 But nobody's listening, washed up and ranting
 About the same old bitter things
 Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
 But all you are is mean
 All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic
 And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
 
 But someday I'll be living in a big old city
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Yeah someday I'll be big enough
 So you can't hit me
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Why you gotta be so 
 Someday I'll be living in a big old city
 
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 
 Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
 
 And all you're ever gonna be is mean
 Why you gotta be so mean?
 
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh
 
 You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
 Left a small town, never looked back
 I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
 Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts
 
 I say, "Can you believe it?"
 As we're lyin' on the couch
 The moment, I can see it
 Yes, yes, I can see it now
 
 Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
 You put your arm around me for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
 
 Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
 And there's a drawer of my things at your place
 You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
 You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
 
 And we got bills to pay
 We got nothin' figured out
 When it was hard to take
 Yes, yes
 This is what I thought about
 
 Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?
 You put your arm around me, for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
 
 Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
 You saw me start to believe, for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 
 And I remember that fight, two-thirty a.m.
 'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
 I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
 
 Braced myself for the goodbye,
 'Cause that's all I've ever known
 Then, you took me by surprise
 You said, "I'll never leave you alone"
 
 You said, "I remember how we felt, sitting by the water.
 And every time I look at you, it's like the first time.
 I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter.
 She is the best thing that's ever been mine."
 
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing, that's ever been mine
 
 Do you believe it?
 We're gonna make it now
 And I can see it
 
 :
 Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Hilton. Um, I met him a couple months ago doing a show out in California, um, and I had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said, "You know, I'm a really big fan of Taylor Swift's music," and I read that and I'm like, wow, that's really cool. So I had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows. And so, you know, I asked him to come out and sing with me. And while he was standing there next to me on stage I said, "Tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" And uh, the crowd, he was kind of silent but the crowd was like, "Yeah! Oh my God!" You guys know how to do that? That's what I like to hear. Anyways, so he's standing here on stage and I'm like straight up, "Do you want to be in a music video? I'm shooting one in a couple weeks." And, uh, he goes, "Well, I guess. Yeah sure." Because I mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. Which was kind of my point of asking him on stage. So basically I forced him to be in my music video. Have ya'll seen that one? Would ya'll like me to bring him out and do a song with him? Tyler Hilton's in the house tonight! So, uh, the song I asked to sing with him, um, a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on One Tree Hill. You see, Tyler is on the show One Tree Hill because he's cool. He was also in the movie Walk The Line, he played Elvis Presley. So I decided to go all out for my hometown. So, uh, Tyler, you going to sing a song with me?
 
 Yeah, let's do it! If you guys know, sing along too.
 
 Taylor:
 Every time I think of you
 I always catch my breath
 I'm still standing here
 And you're miles away
 And I wonder why you left me
 And there's a storm that's raging 
 Through my frozen heart tonight
 
 Tyler:
 I hear your name in certain circles
 And it always makes me smile
 I spent my time just thinking about you
 And it's almost driving me wild
 But it's my heart that's begging 
 Down this long distance line tonight
 
 Both:
 And I ain't missing you at all
 Since you've been gone away
 I ain't missing you
 No matter what I might say
 
 Tyler:
 There's a message in the wires
 And I am sending you a signal tonight
 You don't know how desperate I've become
 And it looks like I'm losing this fight
 But it's my heart that's breaking down 
 This long dusty road of mine
 
 Both:
 But I ain't missing you at all
 Since you've been gone away
 I aint missing you at all
 No matter what my friends say
 
 Taylor:
 And there's a message that I'm sending out
 Like a telegraph to you or something
 I can't bridge this distance
 Honey, stop this heartache all alone
 
 Both:
 I ain't missing you at all
 Since you've been gone away
 I ain't missing you
 No matter what my friends say
 I ain't missing you
 Since you've been gone away
 I ain't missing you
 Yeah, no matter what your friends say
 
 Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 
 I ain't missing you at all
 Since you've been gone away
 I ain't missing you
 No
 
 :
 Good night everybody! Woo! You like that, girls?
 
 I like glitter and sparkly dresses
 But I'm not gonna talk about that
 In my monologue
 
 I like baking and things that smell like winter
 But I'm not gonna talk about that
 In my monologue
 
 La La La
 La La La
 
 I like writing songs about douchebags who cheat on me
 But I'm not gonna say that
 In my monologue
 
 I like writing their names in songs so they're ashamed to go in public
 But I'm not gonna say that
 In my monologue
 
 La La
 La La La La La 
 
 This is my musical monologue
 
 You might think I'd bring up Joe
 That guy who broke up with me on the phone
 But I'm not gonna mention him
 In my monologue
 
 Hey Joe, I'm doin' real well
 Tonight I'm hosting SNL
 But I'm not gonna brag about that
 In my monologue
 
 La La La
 Ha Ha Ha
 Ha Ha Ha
 Ha Ha Ha
 La La La
 
 And if you're wondering if I might
 Be dating the werewolf from Twilight
 
 I'm not gonna comment on that
 In my monologue
 
 La La
 La La La La La
 
 This is my musical monologue
 
 You might be expecting me to say
 Something bad about Kanye
 And how he ran up on the stage
 And ruined my VMA monologue
 
 But there's nothing more to say
 'Cause everything's okay
 I've got security lining the stage
 
 This is my SNL monologue
 
 La la
 La la la la la
 
 This is my SNL monologue
 
 La la
 La la la la la
 
 That was my SNL monologue
 
 I know we've got a lot to say 
 Between now and forever
 But I'd be a game if you would play, 
 And I dare this to get better
 
 So all throughout the day
 You smile and walk away
 All I can think to do, is follow you
 
 And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
 And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
 I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
 
 Wherever you think I am tonight
 Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
 Because in the blink of one pretty brown eye
 I'll be right where you are baby
 
 Sometime along the way 
 You took my breath away
 Distracted by the view
 I fall right into you
 
 And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
 And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
 I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
 
 They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
 But you take one look at me
 And I know the mistake I'd be making
 
 'Cause if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
 And if you ever need my love I'm standing at your door
 I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure
 
 I know we've got a lot to say 
 Between now and forever
 
 On a childhood highway through a night alone 
 I was barely breathing, I was crawling home 
 Well, it's not quite London or the south of France 
 Or an Asian island or a second chance 
 
 Going back to Nashville, thinking about the whole thing 
 Guess you got to run sometimes 
 Maybe I'm a fast train rolling down the mountain 
 Watching all my life go by 
 
 You're a distant memory, you're an exit sign 
 I was talking crazy on the driver's side 
 And I know I hurt you but I won't confess 
 Was that blood or a wine stain on your wedding dress? 
 
 Going back to Nashville, thinking about the whole thing 
 Guess you gotta run sometimes 
 Maybe I'm a fast train rolling down the mountain 
 Watching all my life go by 
 
 Going back to Nashville, laughing at a bad break 
 What's the use in wondering why? 
 Maybe I'm a storm front rolling through the valley 
 Tearing up a good July 
 
 And it's safe and warm where nothing ever happens 
 Would it be so hard to realign a star or two? 
 Change a southern night for you 
 Well, it's not quite evening, and it's not New York 
 
 There's a scar in the blue sky by the old airport 
 And I'm talking crazy on the driver's side 
 I will always love you like a long goodbye
 
 I need you now
 Read letters that I wrote on the wall
 And the message that I left when I called
 
 I need you now
 Words I said drowned out by the rain
 Waiting there for you but you never came
 
 My world's a little colder now
 But I'm keeping warm somehow
 
 So here you are at my window
 Guess nobody told you
 I don't need, don't need you
 And I waited so frustrated
 Who's gonna hold you?
 I don't need you, don't need you now
 
 I need you now
 Words I heard you whisper to me
 We were walking down a one-way street
 
 You need me now
 That's what you've been telling my friends
 But I've come too far to go back there again
 
 My heart, my mind and number have changed
 You might as well forget my name
 
 So here you are at my window
 Guess nobody told you
 I don't need you, don't need you
 And I waited so frustrated
 Who's gonna hold you?
 I don't need you, don't need you now
 
 I need you now
 Read letters that I wrote on the wall
 And the message that I left when I called
 
 So here you are at my window
 Guess nobody told you
 I don't need you, don't need you
 And I waited so frustrated
 So who's gonna hold you?
 I don't need you now
 
 And I don't know where you are
 I don't wonder where you are
 I don't dream about you  
 'cause I don't need you now
 
 I don't dream about the way
 That I never heard you say
 'I need you, I need you'
 I don't need you now
 
 Don't need you
 Don't need you now
 
 Your little hands wrapped around my finger
 And it's so quiet in the world tonight
 Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
 So I tuck you in and tur
  on your favorite nightlight
 
 To you, everything's funny
 You got nothing to regret
 I'd give all I have honey
 If you could stay like that
 
 Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
 Just stay this little
 Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
 It could stay this simple
 I won't let nobody hurt you
 Won't let no one break your heart
 No one will desert you
 Just try to never grow up
 Never grow up
 
 You're in the car on the way to the movies
 And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
 At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
 And you can't wait to move out
 Someday and call your own shots
 
 But don't make her drop you off around the block
 Remember that she's getting older too
 And don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for school
 
 Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
 Just stay this little
 Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
 It could stay this simple
 And no one's ever burned you
 Nothing's ever left you scarred
 And even though you want to
 Just try to never grow up
 
 Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
 Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
 Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
 And all your little brother's favorite songs
 I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
 
 So here I am in my new apartment
 In a big city, they just dropped me off
 It's so much colder than I thought it would be
 So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
 
 Wish I'd never grown up
 I wish I'd never grown up
 Oh I don't wanna grow up
 Wish I'd never grown up
 Could still be little
 Oh I don't wanna grow up
 Wish I'd never grown up
 It could still be simple
 
 Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
 Just stay this little
 Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
 It could stay this simple
 I won't let nobody hurt you
 Won't let no one break your heart
 And even though you want to
 Please try to never grow up
 Don't you ever grow up
 Just never grow up
 
 Look at you
 Look at me
 Look at who
 We could be
 
 I wanna know
 Who you are
 What you want
 From the start
 
 And everytime I look at you
 I can hardly say a thing
 my head starts to spin
 And it hits me then
 I love you
 
 And everytime you look at me 
 I could go crazy but I don't 
 say it but I won't
 Cause I'd rather be alone 
 Than lose you
 
 And all I really wanna do is be next to you
 But I'm too tired to fight
 And I could tell you now
 But baby, nevermind
 
 All the time
 Everyday
 There's nothing I can do baby
 To make it go away
 
 So look at you
 And look at me
 Now think of who
 We could be
 
 And everytime I look at you 
 I can hardly say a thing
 my head starts to spin
 And it hits me then
 I love you
 
 And everytime you look at me I could go crazy 
 but I don't say it but I won't
 Cause I'd rather be alone 
 Than lose you
 
 And all I really wanna do is be next to you
 But I'm too tired to fight
 And I could tell you now
 But baby, nevermind
 
 All I really wanna say is I need you babe
 But how could you understand
 What happens if you turn away
 And everything turns blue and grey
 And I just wish I told you, nevermind
 
 And I could tell you now
 But baby nevermind
 
 Yeah
 Oh yeah
 
 I could tell you now but nevermind
 
 Yeah 
 Oh yeah yeah
 
 And I could tell you now but nevermind
 
 We're all bored
 We're all so tired of everything
 We wait for
 Trains that just aren't coming
 We show off
 Our different scarlet letters
 Trust me, mine is better
 
 We're so young
 But we're on the road to ruin
 We play dumb
 But we know exactly what we're doing
 We cry tears
 Of mascara in the bathroom
 Honey, life is just a classroom
 
 'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
 Out of all the bricks they threw at me
 And every day is like a battle
 But every night with us is like a dream
 
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 Come on, come along with me
 Heart break is the national anthem
 We sing it proudly
 We are too busy dancing
 So get knocked off our feet
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 The best people in life are free
 
 We're all here
 the lights and boys are blinding
 We hang back
 It's all in the timing
 It's poker
 He can't see it in my face
 But I'm about to play my Ace
 
 We need love
 But all we want is danger
 We team up
 Then switch sides like a record changer
 The rumors
 Are terrible and cruel
 But, honey most of them are true
 
 'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
 Out of all the bricks they threw at me
 And every day is like a battle
 But every night with us is like a dream
 
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 Come on, come along with me
 Heart break is the national anthem
 We sing it proudly
 We are too busy dancing
 To get knocked off our feet
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 The best people in life are free
 
 So come on, come along with me
 The best people in life are free
 
 Please take my hand and
 Please take me dancing and
 Please leave me stranded, it's so romantic 
 
 'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
 Out of all the bricks they threw at me
 And every day is like a battle
 But every night with us is like a dream
 
 'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
 Out of all the bricks they threw at me
 And every day is like a battle
 But every night with us is like a dream
 
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 Come on, come along with me
 Heart break is the national anthem
 We sing it proudly
 We are too busy dancing
 To get knocked off our feet
 Baby, we're the new romantics
 The best people in life are free
 
 There's glitter on the floor after the party
 Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
 Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
 You and me from the night before but
 
 Don't read the last page
 But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you're turning away
 I want your midnights
 But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
 
 You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
 I can tell that it's going to be a long road
 I'll be there if you're the toast of the town babe
 Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
 
 Don't read the last page
 But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or you're making mistakes
 I want your midnights
 But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
 
 Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
 Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
 Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
 And I will hold on to you
 
 Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
 Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
 
 There's glitter on the floor after the party
 Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
 Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
 You and me forevermore
 
 Don't read the last page
 But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
 I want your midnights
 But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
 
 Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
 Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
 Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
 And I will hold on to you
 
 Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
 Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
 
 It wasn't just like a movie
 The rain didn't soak through my clothes down to my skin
 Driving away and I guess you could say
 This is the last time I'll drive this way again
 There's nothing to say and I
 I try to grab at the fray 'cause I, I still love you but I can't!
 
 Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
 Bye, bye baby
 I want you back but it has come down to nothing
 All you have is to walk away from
 The one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah.
 
 Picture frame is empty it's black and white
 You're smiling down at me
 I take your photo off the dash
 Back to the conversation we were so sure of everything
 Everything we thought we'd always have.
 Lost in the sound of it, the here and the now comes and
 It seems like I'm becoming part of your past!
 
 Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
 Bye, bye baby
 I want you back but it has come down to nothing
 All you have is to walk away from
 The one thing I thought would never leave me.
 
 There's so much that I can't touch
 You're all I want but it's not enough this time
 And I can feel you like you're slipping through my hands
 And I'm so scared of how this ends.
 
 Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
 Bye, bye baby
 I want you back but it has come down to nothing
 All you have is to walk away from
 The one thing I thought would never leave me.
 
 Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
 Bye, bye baby
 I want you back but it has come down to nothing
 All you have is to walk away from
 The one thing I thought would never leave me
 Yeah, if there was one thing I knew would never leave me...
 
 It wasn't just like a movie
 The rain didn't soak through my clothes down to my skin.
 
 He is sensible and so incredible
 And all my single friends are jealous
 He says everything I need to hear and it's like
 I couldn't ask for anything better
 He opens up my door and I get into his car
 And he says you look beautiful tonight
 And I feel perfectly fine
 
 But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
 And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
 You're so in love that you act insane
 And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
 It's a roller coaster kinda rush
 And I never knew I could feel that much
 And that's the way I loved you
 
 He respects my space
 And never makes me wait
 And he calls exactly when he says he will
 He's close to my mother
 Talks business with my father
 He's charming and endearing
 And I'm comfortable
 
 But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
 And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
 You're so in love that you act insane
 And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
 It's a roller coaster kinda rush
 And I never knew I could feel that much
 And that's the way I loved you
 
 He can't see the smile I'm faking
 And my heart's not breaking
 Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
 And you were wild and crazy
 Just so frustrating intoxicating
 Complicated, got away by some mistake and now
 
 I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
 And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
 I'm so in love that I acted insane
 And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
 It's a roller coaster kinda rush
 And I never knew I could feel that much
 And that's the way I loved you
 
 And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
 Never knew I could feel that much
 And that's the way I loved you
 
 Oh
 We were standing in an empty room
 The moonlight was fallin'
 You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you
 And I coulda spent a life with you
 But those days are over
 You were callin my name 
 When your face faded from view
 
 Wasn't it you that told me?
 The sun would always chase the day
 Wasn't it you that told me?
 
 Angels fly, in the air tonight
 Saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
 Stars collide in the air so light
 Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night
 
 Oh
 I remember waking up with you
 The days doin' nothin'
 You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
 You were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar
 Hope the the world never tore that out of you
 
 Wasn't it you that told me?
 The sun would always chase the day
 Wasn't it you that told me?
 
 Angels fly in the air tonight
 Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
 And stars collide in the air so light
 Or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?
 
 Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
 And the songs we played and the indian days
 Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
 Like harold and martin singing
 
 I was waving as you drove away
 The sunlight was falling
 You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane
 
 Angels fly in the air tonight
 Was it just like the promises that we made?
 And stars collide in the air so light
 Was it just like those promises that you made?
 On our last night
 On our last night 
 Oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, oh 
 
 I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
 He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
 The other on my heart
 I look around, turn the radio down
 He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
 I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
 And he said,
 
 Our song is a slamming screen door
 Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
 When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
 Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
 Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
 And when I got home, before I said amen
 Asking God if he could play it again
 
 I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
 Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
 And lost and thrown away
 Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
 I almost didn't notice all the roses
 And the note that said,
 
 Our song is a slamming screen door
 Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
 When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
 Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
 Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
 And when I got home, before I said amen
 Asking God if he could play it again
 
 I've heard every album, listened to the radio
 Waited for something to come along
 That was as good as our song
 
 'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
 Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
 When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
 'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
 Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date
 Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have
 And when I got home, before I said amen
 Asking God if he could play it again
 Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah
 
 I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
 In the front seat of his car
 I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
 And I wrote down our song
 
 Elevator buttons and morning air,
 Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
 If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
 But right now,
 My time is theirs.
 
 Seems like there's always
 Someone who disapproves,
 They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
 And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
 The jury's out,
 And my choice is you.
 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
 People throw rocks at things that shine,
 And life makes love look hard,
 The stakes are high,
 The waters rough,
 But this love is ours,
 
 You never know what people have up their sleeves,
 Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
 Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
 But I don't care,
 'Cause right now you're mine,
 And you say,
 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
 People throw rocks at things that shine,
 And life makes love look hard,
 The stakes are high,
 The water's rough,
 But this love is ours
 
 And it's not theirs to speculate,
 If it's wrong and,
 Your hands are tough but they are where,
 My belong in,
 I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.
 
 'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,
 And I love the riddles that you speak,
 And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,
 'Cause my heart is yours.
 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
 People throw rocks at things that shine,
 And life makes love look hard,
 
 And don't you worry your pretty little mind,
 People throw rocks at things that shine,
 But they can't take what's ours,
 They can't take what's ours,
 The stakes are high,
 The water's rough,
 But this love is ours.
 
 Looking at it now
 It all seems so simple
 We were lying on your couch
 I remember
 You took a Polaroid of us
 Then discovered 
 The rest of the world was black and white
 But we were in screaming color
 And I remember thinking
 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
 
 Are we out of the woods
 
 Looking at it now
 Last December 
 We were built to fall apart
 Then fall back together 
 Ooh your necklace hanging from my neck
 The night we couldn't quite forget
 When we decided  to move the furniture so we could dance
 Baby, like we stood a chance
 Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
 And I remember thinking
 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
 
 Are we out of the woods?
 
 Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
 Twenty stitches in a hospital room
 When you started crying baby, I did too
 But when the sun came up I was looking at you
 Remember when we couldn't take the heat
 I walked out, I said, I'm setting you free
 But the monsters turned out to be just trees
 When the sun came up you were looking at me
 
 You were looking at me
 Oh!
 You were looking at me
 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? 
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? 
 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
 
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
 Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
 Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
 Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
 
 If you love me then I love you
 Swear by the freckles on the moon
 And maybe this will be enough
 
 I'd like to keep you until I'm old
 But if I can't at least I'll know
 That baby, perfect have I loved
 
 Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
 Before September stole me away from you
 The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
 Because baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me
 
 Saying:
 If you love me then I love you
 Swear by the freckles on the moon
 And maybe this will be enough
 I'd like to keep you until I'm old 
 But if I can't at least I'll know
 That baby, perfect have I loved
 
 I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
 I found the feeling of trying to get lost
 You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
 
 It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet 
 
 And if you love me then I love you
 Swear by the freckles on the moon
 And maybe this will be enough
 I'd like to keep you until I'm old
 But if I can't at least I'll know
 That baby, perfect have I loved
 
 Love was all we knew
 And faith was growing on the vines
 Words were all we had
 And for one summer you were mine
 
 Saying:
 If you love me then I love you
 Swear by the freckles on the moon
 And maybe, this will be enough
 I'd like to keep you until I'm old 
 But if I can't at least I'll know
 That baby, perfect have I loved
 
 I know he loved you
 A long time ago
 I ain't jealous of you
 Just thought you should know
 You were never good enough for him or anything like me
 So you might as well sit back 'cause I ain't tryin to show maturity
 
 CHORUS
 X is the shape I drew through your face
 In permanent marker
 Oh yeah
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin
 Who do you think you are
 To write on his heart 
 In permanent marker
 
 So I found that picture
 Of you in that green dress
 Sure had a good time
 Cleanin up that mess
 He found 30 other pieces but he'll never find 'em all
 Tried to tape them back together 
 Now he knows to keep it off the wall
 
 CHORUS
 X is the shape I drew through your face
 In permanent marker
 Oh yeah
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin
 Who do you think you are
 To write on his heart 
 In permanent marker
 
 Well I don't appreciate you callin him to reminisce
 The only reason is you're seein just how much better off he is
 
 CHORUS
 X is the shape I drew through your face
 In permanent marker
 Oh yeah
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin
 Who do you think you are
 To Write on his heart
 
 CHORUS
 X is the shape I drew through your face
 In permanent marker
 Oh yeah
 Just like the mark you knew you were makin
 Who do you think you are
 To Write on his heart
 In permanent marker
 In permanent marker
 Oh 
 Permanent marker
 
 State the obvious
 I didn't get my perfect fantasy
 I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
 So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
 That's fine!
 I'll tell mine
 You're gay
 By the way
 
 I hate that
 Stupid old pickup truck
 You never let me drive
 You're a redneck heartbreak
 Who's really bad at lying
 So watch me strike a match
 On all my wasted time
 As far as I'm concerned you're
 Just another picture to burn
 
 There's no time for tears
 I'm just sitting here
 Planning my revenge
 There's nothing stopping me
 From going out with all of your best friends
 And if you come around saying sorry to me
 My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
 
 'Cause I hate that
 Stupid old pickup truck
 You never let me drive
 You're a redneck heartbreak
 Who's really bad at lying
 So watch me strike a match
 On all my wasted time
 As far as I'm concerned you're
 Just another picture to burn
 
 If you're missing me
 You'd better keep it to yourself
 'Cause coming back around here
 Would be bad for your health
 
 'Cause I hate that
 Stupid old pickup truck
 You never let me drive
 
 You're a redneck heartbreak
 Who's really bad at lying
 
 So watch me strike a match
 On all my wasted time
 In case you haven't heard
 
 I really really hate that
 Stupid old pickup truck
 You never let me drive
 You're a redneck heartbreak
 Who's really bad at lying
 So watch me strike a match
 On all my wasted time
 As far as I'm concerned you're
 Just another picture to burn
 
 Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
 Just another picture to burn
 Baby, burn
 
 Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
 Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
 But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
 Holdin' him for ransom
 Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
 He don't try at all, though
 Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
 I see nothing better, I keep him forever
 Like a vendetta-ta
 
 I-I-I see how this is gon' go
 Touch me and you'll never be alone
 I-Island breeze and lights down low
 No one has to know
 
 In the middle of the night, in my dreams
 You should see the things we do, baby
 In the middle of the night, in my dreams
 I know I'm gonna be with you
 So I take my time
 Are you ready for it?
 
 Me, I was a robber first time that he saw me
 Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
 But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
 And we'll move to an island-and
 And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
 Every lover known in comparison is a failure
 I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
 Never be the same now, now
 
 I-I-I see how this is gon' go
 Touch me and you'll never be alone
 I-Island breeze and lights down low
 No one has to know
 
 In the middle of the night, in my dreams
 You should see the things we do, baby
 In the middle of the night in my dreams
 I know I'm gonna be with you
 So I take my time
 Are you ready for it?
 Ooh, are you ready for it?
 
 Baby, let the games begin
 Let the games begin
 Let the games begin
 Baby, let the games begin
 Let the games begin
 Let the games begin
 
 I-I-I see how this is gon' go
 Touch me and you'll never be alone
 I-Island breeze and lights down low
 No one has to know
 
 In the middle of the night, in my dreams
 You should see the things we do, baby
 In the middle of the night, in my dreams
 I know I'm gonna be with you
 So I take my time
 In the middle of the night
 
 Baby, let the games begin
 Let the games begin
 Let the games begin
 Are you ready for it?
 Baby, let the games begin
 Let the games begin
 Let the games begin
 Are you ready for it?
 
 Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
 Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly
 Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
 Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
 
 Losing him was blue like I'd never known
 Missing him was dark grey all alone
 Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
 But loving him was red
 Loving him was red
 
 Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
 Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
 Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
 Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
 
 Losing him was blue like I'd never known
 Missing him was dark gray all alone
 Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
 But loving him was red
 Oh red
 Burning red
 
 Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
 Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
 But moving on from him is impossible
 When I still see it all in my head
 Burning red
 Burning it was red
 
 Oh losing him was blue like I'd never known
 Missing him was dark gray all alone
 Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
 'Cause loving him was red
 Yeah, yeah red
 We're burning red
 
 And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
 Comes back to me, burning red
 Yeah, yeah
 His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
 
 Here's something I've learned about people
 
 We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip
 
 This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you
 
 The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'
 
 When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?
 
 Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...
 
 We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us
 
 There will be no further explanation
 There will be just reputation
 
 Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
 Ha, time for a little revenge
 
 The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
 And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
 She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
 She took him faster than you could say sabotage
 I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
 I underestimated just who I was dealing with
 She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
 She underestimated just who she was stealing from
 
 She's not a saint and she's not what you think
 She's an actress, whoa
 She's better known for the things that she does
 On the mattress, whoa
 Soon she's gonna find
 Stealing other people's toys on the playground
 Won't make you many friends
 She should keep in mind,
 She should keep in mind
 There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
 
 She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
 She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
 I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
 And, she thinks I'm psycho
 'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
 Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
 Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
 Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
 So it's up to me
 But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
 
 She's not a saint and she's not what you think
 She's an actress, whoa
 She's better known for the things that she does
 On the mattress, whoa
 Soon she's gonna find
 Stealing other people's toys on the playground
 Won't make you many friends
 She should keep in mind,
 She should keep in mind
 There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
 
 I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
 You might have him, but haven't you heard
 I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
 You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
 Whoa
 
 She's not a saint and she's not what you think
 She's an actress, whoa
 She's better known for the things that she does
 On the mattress, whoa
 Soon she's gonna find
 Stealing other people's toys on the playground
 Won't make you many friends
 She should keep in mind,
 She should keep in mind
 There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
 
 And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
 'Cause I don't think you do, oh
 Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
 I don't think you do, I don't think you do
 Let's hear the applause
 C'mon show me how much better you are
 See you deserve some applause
 'Cause you're so much better
 She took him faster than you could say sabotage
 
 Elevator buttons and morning air,
 Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
 If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
 But right now, 
 My time is theirs.
 
 Seems like there's always
 Someone who disapproves,
 They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
 And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
 The jury's out,
 And my choice is you.
 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
 People throw rocks at things that shine,
 And life makes love look hard,
 The stakes are high,
 The waters rough,
 But this love is ours,
 
 You never know what people have up their sleeves,
 Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
 Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
 But I don't care,
 'Cause right now you're mine,
 And you say,
 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind, 
 People throw rocks at things that shine,
 And life makes love look hard,
 The stakes are high,

 And it's not theirs to speculate,
 If it's wrong and,
 Your hands are tough but they are where,

 'Cause I love the gap between your teeth,
 And I love the riddles that you speak,
 And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,
 'Cause my heart is yours.
 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind,

 And life makes love look hard,
 
 And don't you worry your pretty little mind,
 People throw rocks at things that shine,
 But they can't take what's ours,
 They can't take what's ours,
 The stakes are high,
 The water's rough,
 But this love is ours.
 
 I was scared of dentists and the dark
 I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
 Oh, all my friends are turning green
 You're the magician's assistant in their dreams
 
 Oh, and they come unstuck
 
 Lady, running down to the riptide
 Taken away to the dark side
 I wanna be your left hand man
 I love you when you're singing that song and
 I got a lump in my throat because
 You're gonna sing the words wrong
 
 There's this movie that I think you'll like
 This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
 This cowboy's running from himself
 And she's been living on the highest shelf
 
 Oh, and they come unstuck
 
 Lady, running down to the riptide
 Taken away to the dark side
 I wanna be your left hand man
 I love you when you're singing that song and
 I got a lump in my throat because
 You're gonna sing the words wrong
 
 I just wanna, I just wanna know
 If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
 I just gotta, I just gotta know
 I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
 I swear she's destined for the screen
 Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
 
 Lady, running down to the riptide
 Taken away to the dark side
 I wanna be your left hand man
 I love you when you're singing that song and
 I got a lump in my throat because
 You're gonna sing the words wrong
 
 Oh lady, running down to the riptide
 Taken away to the dark side
 I wanna be your left hand man
 I love you when you're singing that song and
 I got a lump in my throat because
 You're gonna sing the words wrong
 
 Oh lady, running down to the riptide
 Taken away to the dark side
 I wanna be your left hand man
 I love you when you're singing that song and
 I got a lump in my throat because
 You're gonna sing the words wrong
 I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong
 
 I remember your bare feet down the hallway
 I remember your little laugh
 Race cars on the kitchen floor
 Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back
 
 I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club
 I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up
 I can still feel you hold my hand
 Little man, from even that moment I knew
 You fought it hard like an army guy
 Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
 
 Come on baby with me
 We're gonna fly away from here
 You were my best four years
 
 I remember the drive home when the blind hope
 Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
 Flowers piled up in the worst way
 No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died
 
 And it's about to be Halloween
 You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
 
 I remember the last day when I kissed your face
 I whispered in your ear
 
 Come on baby with me
 We're gonna fly away from here
 Out of this curtained room in this hospital
 We'll just disappear
 Come on baby with me
 We're gonna fly away from here
 You were my best four years
 
 What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
 What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?
 And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
 But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you
 
 Come on baby with me
 We're gonna fly away from here
 Come on baby with me
 We're gonna fly away from here
 You were my best four years
 
 I remember your bare feet down the hallway
 I love you to the moon and back
 
 There's a plane or a bus leaving from Dallas
 I hope you're on it
 If there's a train moving fast down the tracks
 I hope you caught it
 
 Because I swear out there ain't where
 You ought to be
 So catch a ride or catch a cab
 Don't you know that I miss you bad
 But don't you walk to me
 
 Baby, run
 Cut a path across the blue sky
 Straight in a straight line
 You can't get here fast enough
 Find a truck and fire it up
 Lean on the gas and off the clutch
 Leave Dallas in the dust
 I need you in a rush
 So baby, run
 So baby, run
 
 Oh, if you ain't got a suitcase
 Get a box
 Or an old brown paper sack
 Pack it light or pack it heavy
 Take a truck, take a Chevy
 
 Baby, just come back
 There's a shortcut to the highway out of town
 Why don't you take it
 Don't let that speed limit slow you down
 Go on and break it
 Baby, break it
 
 And run
 Cut a path across the blue sky
 Straight in a straight line
 You can't get here fast enough
 Find a truck and fire it up
 Lean on the gas and off the clutch
 Leave Dallas in the dust
 I need you in a rush
 So baby, run
 
 Run to me
 Baby, run
 Run to me
 So baby, run
 Run
 Oh baby, run
 
 Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
 Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
 I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
 Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
 
 We had a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 
 In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
 We both wake in lonely beds in different cities
 And time, is taking its sweet time erasing you
 And you've got your demons, and darling they all look like me
 
 'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 
 Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
 Silence, this train runs off its tracks
 Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
 Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back
 
 A beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful
 
 What we had, a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 
 We had a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 
 I remember tears streaming down your face when I said I'll never let you go
 When all those shadows almost killed your light
 I remember you said don't leave me here alone
 But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
 
 Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
 You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
 Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound
 
 Don't you dare look out your window, darling everything's on fire
 The war outside our door keeps raging on
 Hold onto this lullaby even when the musics gone, gone
 
 Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
 You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
 Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound
 
 Just close your eyes, you'll be alright
 Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound
 
 Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
 I've been an awful good girl, Santa baby
 So hurry down the chimney tonight
 
 Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
 Well I'll wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
 So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah
 
 Think of all the fun I've missed
 Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
 Next year I could be just as good
 If you check off my Christmas list
 
 Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
 I've been an angel all year, Santa baby
 So hurry down the chimney tonight
 
 Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed
 To a platinum mine, Santa honey
 So hurry down the chimney tonight
 
 Come and trim my Christmas tree
 With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
 I really do believe in you
 Let's see if you believe in me
 
 Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
 A ring
 And I don't mean on the phone, Santa baby
 So hurry down the chimney tonight
 
 Do you remember
 The 28th night of September?
 Love was changin' the minds of pretenders
 While chasin' the clouds away
 Our hearts were ringin'
 In the key that our souls were singin'
 As we danced in the night, remember
 How the stars stole the night away
 
 Ahh-ahh-ahh
 Hey, say that you remember
 Ai, ai, dancin' in September
 Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
 
 My thoughts are with you
 Holding hands with your heart to see you
 Only blue talk and love
 Remember how we knew love was here to stay
 Now, December found the love that we shared in September
 Only blue talk and love
 Remember the love that we share today
 
 Ahh-ahh-ahh
 Hey, say that you remember
 Ai, ai, dancin' in September
 Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
 Ahh-ahh-ahh
 Hey, say that you remember
 Ai, ai, dancin' in September
 Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days
 
 Do you remember
 The 28th night of September?
 
 Ahh-ahh-ahh
 Hey, say that you remember
 Ai, ai, dancin' in September
 Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
 Ahh-ahh-ahh
 Hey, say that you remember
 Ai, ai, dancin' in September
 Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days
 And there never was a cloudy day
 There never was a cloudy day
 
 I stay out too late, got nothin' in my brain
 That's what people say, mmm hmm, that's what people say, mmm hmm
 I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay
 At least that's what people say mmm mmm, that's what people say mmm mmm
 
 But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop moving
 It's like I got this music in my mind, sayin' gonna be alright
 
 'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
 And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
 Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
 And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
 Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 
 I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
 And that's what they don't see mmm mmm, that's what they don't see mmm mmm
 I'm dancing on my own , I'll make the moves up as I go 
 And that's what they don't know mmm mmm, that's what they don't know mmm mmm
 
 But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop grooving
 It's like I got this music in my mind saying it's gonna be alright
 
 'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
 And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
 Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
 And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
 Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 I, I shake it off, I shake it off
 I, I shake it off, I shake it off
 I, I shake it off, I shake it off
 
 Hey, hey, hey
 Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats in the world 
 You could have been getting down to this sick beat
 
 My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
 She's like "oh my God", but I'm just gonna shake it
 And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
 Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake, yeah oh
 
 'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
 And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate 
 Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
 And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake 
 Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 I, I shake it off, I shake it off
 I, I shake it off, I shake it off
 I, I shake it off, I shake it off
 I shake it off, I shake it off
 I, I shake it off, I shake it off
 I, I shake it off, I shake it off
 I, I shake it off, I shake it off
 
 Strange to think the songs we used to sing
 The smiles, the flowers, everything
 Is gone
 Yesterday I found out about you
 Even now just looking at you
 Feels wrong
 You say that you'd take it all back
 Given one chance; it was a moment of weakness
 And you said "yes"
 
 You should've said no
 You should've gone home
 You should've thought twice before you let it all go
 You should've known that word like what you did with her
 Would get back to me 
 And I should've been there
 In the back of your mind
 I shouldn't be asking myself why
 You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
 You should've said no
 Baby, and you might still have me
 
 You can see that I've been cryin'
 Baby, you know all the right things
 To say
 But do you, honestly
 Expect me to believe
 We could ever be the same?
 You say that the past is the past
 You need one chance; it was a moment of weakness
 And you said "yes"
 
 You should've said no
 You should've gone home
 You should've thought twice before you let it all go
 You should've known that word like what you did with her
 Would get back to me 
 And I should've been there
 In the back of your mind
 I shouldn't be asking myself why
 You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
 You should've said no
 Baby, and you might still have me
 
 I can't resist
 Before you go, tell me this
 Was it worth it?
 Was she worth this?
 
 No, no
 No, no, no, no
 
 You should've said no
 You should've gone home
 You should've thought twice before you let it all go
 You should've known that word like what you did with her
 Would get back to me 
 And I should've been there
 In the back of your mind
 I shouldn't be asking myself why
 You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
 You should've said no
 Baby, and you might still have me
 
 Silent night, holy night
 All is calm and all is bright
 Round young virgin mother and child
 Holy infant so tender and mild
 Sleep in heavenly peace
 Sleep in heavenly peace
 
 Silent night, holy night
 Shepherds quake at the sight
 Glories stream from heaven afar
 Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
 Christ the savior is born
 Christ our savior is born
 
 Silent night, holy night
 Son of God
 Love's pure light
 Radiant beams from thy holy face
 With the dawn of redeeming grace
 Jesus Lord at thy birth
 Jesus Lord at thy birth
 
 Hallelujah
 Hallelujah
 Hallelujah
 
 Christ the savior is born
 
 Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand 
 I wonder if a broken heart feel the warmth on my hand 
 Don't wonder how a piece of driftwood could see more through his lifetime 
 Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights 
 
 I've seen a million things 
 spoke a million words 
 now i only want to speak to you 
 
 Waiting for the words 
 counting every bird 
 there's nothing i'd rather do 
 on smokey black nights 
 
 Still through the haze i can make out constellations 
 I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand 
 And i saw that sunset gleamin as my eyes went wild 
 Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights 
 
 I've played a thousand songs 
 sang a thousand words 
 now i only want to sing to you 
 
 Waited on a wire 
 starin at the fire 
 there's nothing i'd rather do 
 on the smokey black nights 
 
 Yeah 
 
 I've walked a thousand miles 
 smiled a thousand smiles 
 Now I only smile when I'm with you 
 
 Waiting for the words 
 counting every bird 
 there's nothing i'd rather do 
 on the smokey black nights 
 
 So walk with me 
 As the sweet wind dances 
 I'm writing a song for you and me 
 On the smokey black nights
 
 See you in the dark
 All eyes on you, my magician
 All eyes on us
 You make everyone disappear, and
 Cut me into pieces
 Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
 Back against the wall
 Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone
 
 'Cause we break down a little
 And when you get me alone, it's so simple
 'Cause baby, I know what you know
 We can feel it
 
 And our pieces fall
 Right into place
 Get caught up in the moments
 Lipstick on your face
 So it goes
 I'm yours to keep
 And I'm yours to lose
 You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
 Do bad things with you
 So it goes
 
 Met you in a bar
 All eyes on me, your illusion is
 All eyes on us
 I make all your grey days clear and
 Wear you like a necklace
 I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
 But I got your heart
 Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone
 
 'Cause we break down a little
 And when you get me alone, it's so simple
 'Cause baby, I know what you know
 We can feel it
 
 And our pieces fall
 Right into place
 Get caught up in the moments
 Lipstick on your face
 So it goes
 I'm yours to keep
 And I'm yours to lose
 You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
 Do bad things with you
 So it goes
 
 Come here, dressed in black now
 So, so, so it goes
 Scratches down your back now
 So, so, so it goes
 
 You did a number on me
 But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
 I did a number on you
 But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
 You did a number on me
 But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
 Who's counting?
 1, 2, 3
 
 And our pieces fall 
 Right into place
 Get caught up in the moments 
 Lipstick on your face
 So it goes
 I'm yours to keep 
 And I'm yours to lose 
 You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
 Do bad things with you
 So it goes
 
 Come here, dressed in black now
 So, so, so it goes
 Scratches down your back now
 So, so, so it goes
 Come here, dressed in black now
 So, so, so it goes
 Scratches down your back now
 So, so, so it goes
 
 The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
 And I'm a house of cards
 You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
 But I kinda know that I won't get far
 
 And you stood there in front of me just
 Close enough to touch
 Close enough to hope you couldn't see
 What I was thinking of
 
 Drop everything now
 Meet me in the pouring rain
 Kiss me on the sidewalk
 Take away the pain
 'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
 
 Get me with those green eyes, baby
 As the lights go down
 Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around
 'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile
 
 My mind forgets to remind me, your a bad idea
 You touch me once and it's really something
 You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be
 I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
 But with you I know its no good
 And I could wait patiently
 But I really wish you would
 
 Drop everything now
 Meet me in the pouring rain
 Kiss me on the sidewalk
 Take away the pain
 'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
 
 Get me with those green eyes, baby
 As the lights go down
 Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
 'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
 
 I run my fingers through your hair
 And watch the lights go wild
 Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
 Its just wrong enough to make it feel right
 And lead me up the staircase
 Won't you whisper soft and slow
 And I'm captivated by you baby
 Like a fireworks show
 
 Drop everything now
 Meet me in the pouring rain
 Kiss me on the sidewalk
 Take away the pain
 'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
 
 Get me with those green eyes, baby
 As the lights go down
 Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around
 'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile
 
 When sparks fly oh baby smile
 When sparks fly
 
 I am not the kind of girl
 Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
 But you are not the kind of boy
 Who should be marryin' the wrong girl
 
 I sneak in and see your friends
 And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel
 And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
 Somewhere back inside a room
 Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
 This is surely not what you thought it would be
 I lose myself in a daydream
 Where I stand and say
 
 "Don't say yes, run away now
 I'll meet you when you're out
 Of the church at the back door
 Don't wait or say a single vow
 You need to hear me out"
 And they said, "speak now"
 
 Fond gestures are exchanged
 And the organ starts to play
 A song that sounds like a death march
 And I am hiding in the curtains
 It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
 She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
 But I know you wish it was me
 You wish it was me, don't you?
 
 Don't say yes, run away now
 I'll meet you when you're out
 Of the church at the back door
 Don't wait or say a single vow
 You need to hear me out
 And they said, "speak now"
 
 Don't say yes, run away now
 I'll meet you when you're out
 Of the church at the back door
 Don't wait or say a single vow
 Your time is running out
 And they said, "speak now"
 
 I hear the preacher say
 "Speak now or forever hold your peace"
 There's a silence, there's my last chance
 I stand up with shaking hands
 All eyes on me
 Horrified looks from everyone in the room
 But I'm only lookin' at you
 
 I am not the kind of girl
 Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
 But you are not the kind of boy,
 Who should be marryin' the wrong girl
 
 So don't say yes, run away now
 I'll meet you when you're out
 Of the church at the back door
 Don't wait or say a single vow
 You need to hear me out
 And they said, "speak now"
 
 And you say, "let's run away now
 I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door
 Oh baby, I didn't say my vow
 So glad you were around when they said, "speak now"
 
 Days go by, I wonder if you here me
 Can't you read between the lines?
 Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
 Take this chance, I'll make you mine
 
 Don't you wonder why
 You change in time
 Makes you feel so empty inside
 
 But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
 I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
 And all I see is someone I don't know
 Love's got me tangled, tired me too
 No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
 Spinning me around
 And baby all I see is you
 
 He tells lies, are you really thinking
 That you deserve another try
 When you see these eyes
 You see another planet
 Don't ask how, but fate decides
 
 Don't you wonder why
 You change in time
 Makes you feel so empty inside
 
 But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
 I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
 And all I see is someone I don't know
 Love's got me tangled, tired me too
 No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
 Spinning me around
 And baby all I see is you
 
 Spinning and turning
 And living and learning
 I should be able to handle this
 Make it or break it
 Move it or shake it
 Do it or fake it
 Girl you've got to make it
 
 But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
 I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
 And all I see is someone I don't know
 Love's got me tangled, tired me too
 No sign of a wall, sign of wall,
 Spinning me around
 And baby all I see is you
 
 Spinning me around
 And baby all I see is you
 
 Spinning me around
 And all I see is you
 
 I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
 It was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
 The whole place was dressed to the nines,
 And we were dancing, dancing
 Like we're made of starlight
 Like we're made of starlight
 
 I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
 Picked me up late one night at the window,
 We were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
 Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
 The night we snuck into a yacht club party
 Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
 
 And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
 It was the best night, never would forget how we moved.
 The whole place was dressed to the nines,
 And we were dancing, dancing
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 
 He said, "Look at you, worrying so much about things you can't change
 You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
 He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me,
 "Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
 Don't you dream impossible things?"
 
 Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
 It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
 The whole place was dressed to the nines,
 And we were dancing, dancing
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 
 Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
 Ooh ooh dancing with me
 Ooh ooh we could get married
 Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
 
 Oh my, what a marvelous tune
 It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
 The whole place was dressed to the nines,
 And we were dancing, dancing
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 Like we dream impossible dreams
 Like starlight, starlight
 Like we dream impossible dreams
 Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
 Don't you dream impossible things?
 
 I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
 Busy streets and busy lives
 And all we know
 Is touch and go
 We are alone with our changing minds
 We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
 
 And I never  saw you coming
 And I'll never  be the same
 
 You come around and the armor falls
 Pierce the room like a cannon boom
 Now all we know is don't let go
 We are alone, just you and me
 Up in your room and our slates are clean
 Just twin fire signs
 Four blue eyes
 
 So you were never a saint
 And I've loved in shades of wrong
 We learn to live with the pain
 Mosaic broken hearts
 But this love is brave and wild
 
 And I never  saw you coming
 And I'll never  be the same
 
 This is a state of grace
 This is the worthwhile fight
 Love is a ruthless game
 Unless you play it good and right
 These are the hands of fate
 You're my Achilles heel
 This is the golden age of something good and right and real
 
 And I never  saw you coming
 And I'll never  be the same
 
 And I never  saw you coming
 And I'll never be the same
 
 This is a state of grace
 This is the worthwhile fight
 Love is a ruthless game
 Unless you play it good and right
 
 Cory's eyes are like a jungle
 He smiles; it's like the radio
 He whispers songs into my window
 In words that nobody knows
 There's pretty girls on every corner
 They watch him as he's walking home
 Saying, does he know
 Will you ever know?
 
 You're beautiful
 Every little piece, love; don't you know?
 You're really gonna be someone
 Ask anyone
 And when you find everything you've looked for
 I hope your love leads you back to my door
 Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful
 
 Cory finds another way to be
 The highlight of my day
 I'm taking pictures in my mind
 So I can save them for a rainy day
 It's hard to make a conversation
 When he's taking my breath away
 I should say "hey, by the way
 
 You're beautiful
 Every little piece, love; don't you know?
 You're really gonna be someone
 Ask anyone
 And when you find everything you've looked for
 I hope your love leads you back to my door
 Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful
 
 If you and I are a story
 That never gets told
 If what you are is a daydream
 I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know
 
 You're beautiful
 Every little piece, love; don't you know?
 You're really gonna be someone
 Ask anyone
 And when you find everything you've looked for
 I hope your love leads you back to my front door
 Oh, but if it don't
 Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
 Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
 Oh, oh, oh
 
 Oh, oh, oh
 Oh, but if it don't
 Stay beautiful
 Stay beautiful
 Na, na, na, na, na
 
 I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
 I threw my phone across the room at you
 I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
 But you stayed
 
 This morning I said we should talk about it
 'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
 That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said "okay, let's talk."
 
 And I said,
 Stay, stay, stay
 I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
 You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
 But I think that it's best if we both stay
 
 Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
 That took all of their problems out on me
 But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'
 And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
 
 Stay, stay, stay
 I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
 You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
 But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay
 
 You took the time to memorize me
 My fears, my hopes, and dreams
 I just like hangin' out with you, all the time
 All those times that you didn't leave
 It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life
 
 Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
 No one else is going to love me, when I get mad, mad mad
 So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
 
 Stay, stay, stay
 I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
 You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
 But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
 
 Stay, stay, stay
 I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
 You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
 But I think that it's best if we both stay
 
 Let me know how's it feel 
 To be under my skin 
 Wrapped around my heart 
 Is it like anywhere you've been? 
 And everything I do I do it just for you 
 
 So why the hell don't you love me? 
 Why the hell don't you need me 
 Like I need you?
 Are you so far above me? 
 Don't you know there's nothing I wouldn't do?
 But I was just a toy 
 That's what you destroyed 
 Stupid Boy 
 
 I have been looking in 
 Tryin' to read your mind 
 Give you the benefit of the doubt 
 Every single time 
 But didn't you walk right by 
 I'm screamin' out inside 
 
 So why the hell don't you love me? 
 Why the hell don't you need me? 
 Like I need you 
 Why are you so far above me?
 Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
 
 But I was just a toy 
 That's what you destroyed 
 Stupid Boy 
 
 What happens when you wake up 
 And see what you've lost 
 Take one look at me 'cause 
 That's what it cost 
 I was gonna be everything you need 
 Cause you are everything to me 
 
 So why the hell won't you love me? 
 Why the hell won't you need me? 
 Like I need you 
 Why are you so far above me? 
 Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
 But I was just a toy 
 That's what you destroyed 
 Stupid Boy 
 
 Let me know how's it feel 
 To be under my skin
 
 Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
 Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
 Fade into view, oh,
 It's been a while since I have even heard from you
 
 And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
 Know exactly where it leads but I
 Watch it go round and round each time
 
 You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
 And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
 You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
 And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
 
 So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
 Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat 
 I say "I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl"
 He says "What you've heard is true but I
 Can't stop thinking about you" and I
 I said "I've been there too a few times"
 
 'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
 And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
 You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
 And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt 
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 'Cause we never go  out of style, we never go out of style
 
 Take me home
 Just take me home
 Yeah just take me home, oh
 
  You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
 And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
 
 Tall dark and Superman
 He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
 To save the world or go to work
 It's the same thing to me
 Hes got his mothers eyes, his fathers ambition
 I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
 And I know every word that you say, yay
 You smile and say, "How are you?"
 And I'll say, "Just fine"
 I always forget to tell you,
 I love you, I love you, forever
 
 I watch superman fly away
 You've got a busy day today
 Go save the world I'll be around
 I watch superman fly away
 Come back I'll be with you someday
 I'll be right here on the ground
 When you come back down
 
 Talk dark and beautiful
 He's complicated, he's so irrational
 But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeah
 Something in his deep browns eyes has me singin'
 He's not as bad like this reputation
 I can't hear one single word they said, no
 You really got places to be and I'll be old then
 I always forget to tell you I love you,
 I loved you from the very first day
 
 I watch superman fly away
 You've got a busy day today
 Go save the world I'll be around
 I watch superman fly away
 Come back I'll be with you someday
 I'll be right here on the ground
 When you come back down
 
 And I watch you fly around the world
 And I hope you don't take some other girl
 I hope you don't forget about me
 I'm far away but I'll never let you go
 I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
 Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
 Right here wishing the flowers were from you
 Wishing the card was from you
 Wishing the call was from you
 
 'Cause I loved you from the very first day
 
 I watch superman fly away
 You've got a busy day today to save the world
 I'll be around forever and ever here
 I watch superman fly away
 I swear I'll be with you someday
 I'll be right here on the ground
 When you come back down
 
 La, la, la
 
 When you come back down
 
 This is wrong but
 I can't help but feel like
 There ain't nothing more right babe
 Misty morning comes again and I can't
 Help but wish I could see your face
 
 And I knew from the first note played
 I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
 You smile that beautiful smile
 And all the girls in the front row scream your name
 
 So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
 I can't take my eyes off of you
 I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
 Who's desperately in love with you
 Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
 Superstar
 
 Good morning loneliness
 Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
 When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town
 And I knew when I saw your face I'd be
 Counting down the ways to see you
 And you smile that beautiful smile
 And all the girls in the front row scream your name
 
 So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
 I can't take my eyes off of you
 I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
 Who's desperately in love with you
 Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
 Superstar
 
 You played in bars, you play guitar
 And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
 And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
 Every night from the radio
 
 So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
 I can't take my eyes off of you
 I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
 Who's desperately in love with you
 Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
 Superstar
 Sweet, sweet superstar
 Superstar
 
 Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
 Whistle County creek
 Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
 Baby, you were watching me
 Cold barn struck bed, everything you said
 Slowly educating me
 I never had a lesson so sweet
 
 You can get high on a first kiss
 You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
 You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
 Nothing's shatterproof
 You can crash and burn and come back someone new
 And that's what I learned from you
 
 Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
 Just like the two of us
 Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
 Guess I loved you way too much
 But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
 But it's still soft enough to cry
 Because I remember those times
 
 I remember . . .
 
 You can get high on a first kiss
 You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
 You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
 Nothing's shatterproof
 You can crash and burn and come back someone new
 And that's what I learned from you
 
 Saw you just the other day
 All that I could think to say was
 "Hey, how have you been?"
 You caught me with that old smile
 Said, "It's really been a while
 And I still think about back when . . ."
 
 We used to get high on the first kiss
 We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
 And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
 Nothing's shatterproof
 You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
 And that's what I learned from you
 
 Oh, that's what I learned from you
 That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
 That's what I learned from you, oh yeah
 
 Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
 Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"
 You never saw it coming
 Slipped when you started running
 And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I
 
 Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
 Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
 Wish I could make it better
 Someday you won't remember
 This pain you thought would last forever and ever
 
 And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
 I will say, I knew it all along
 Your eyes' wider than distance
 This life's sweeter than fiction
 
 Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
 All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
 They never saw it coming
 You hit the ground running
 And now you're onto something, I, I, I say
 
 What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
 Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
 And in this perfect weather
 It's like we don't remember
 The rain we thought would last forever and ever
 
 And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
 I will say, I knew it all along
 Your eyes' wider than distance
 This life's sweeter than fiction
 
 There you'll stand, next to me
 All at once, the rest is history
 Your eyes' wider than distance
 This life's sweeter than fiction, fiction
 
 I'll be one of the many saying,
 Look at you now, look at you now, now
 I'll be one of the many saying,
 You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
 I'll be one of the many saying,
 Look at you now, look at you now, now
 I'll be one of the many saying,
 You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
 
 And when they call your name
 And they put your picture in a frame
 You know that I'll be there time and again
 'Cause I loved you when, when you
 
 Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
 Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"
 Now in this perfect weather
 It's like we don't remember
 The rain we thought would last forever and ever 
 
 There you'll stand, ten feet tall
 I will say, I knew it all along
 Your eyes' wider than distance
 This life's sweeter than fiction
 
 There you'll stand next to me
 All at once, the rest is history
 Your eyes' wider than distance
 This life's sweeter than fiction, fiction
 
 It's sweeter than fiction
 It's sweeter, yeah
 It's sweeter than, sweeter
 Sweeter than fiction
 
 Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
 That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
 I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
 And she's got everything that I have to live without
 
 Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it is just so funny
 That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
 He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
 I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
 
 He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
 The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
 He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
 
 Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
 And there he goes, so perfectly,
 The kind of flawless I wish I could be
 She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
 Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause
 
 He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
 The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
 He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
 
 So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
 I'll put his picture down and maybe
 Get some sleep tonight
 
 Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
 The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
 He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
 He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
 And he's all that I need to fall into
 
 Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
 
 I took a chance, I took a shot
 And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
 You took a swing, I took it hard
 And down here from the ground I see who you are
 
 I'm sick and tired of your attitude
 I'm feeling like I don't know you
 You tell me that you love me then you cut me down
 
 And I need you like a heartbeat
 But you know you got a mean streak
 Makes me run for cover when you're around
 And here's to you and your temper
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 Tell me why
 
 You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
 Well I get so confused and frustrated
 Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
 
 I'm sick and tired of your reasons
 I got no one to believe in
 You tell me that you want me, then push me around
 
 And I need you like a heartbeat
 But you know you got a mean streak
 Makes me run for cover when you're around
 And here's to you and your temper
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 Tell me why
 
 Why, do you have to make me feel small
 So you can feel whole inside
 Why, do you have to put down my dreams
 So you're the only thing on my mind
 
 Well I'm sick and tired of your attitude
 I'm feeling like I don't know you
 You tell me that you want me then cut me down
 I'm sick and tired of your reasons
 I've got no one to believe in
 
 You ask me for my love then you push me around
 Here's to you and your temper
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 Tell me why
 Why, tell me why
 
 I take a step back, let you go
 I told you I'm not bulletproof
 Now you know
 
 You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
 You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half
 
 Everybody said that you were bad news
 But baby I was betting on you
 
 So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
 Got myself a big country serving to pay back
 Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
 But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
 
 I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
 The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes
 
 Everything changed when you took me to town
 Caught you staring every other girl down
 
 So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
 Got myself a big country serving to pay back
 Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
 But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
 
 Can't believe the time you lost me
 Can't believe what it cost me
 
 Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
 Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
 I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
 You ain't never been through that
 You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
 You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
 
 I said I know
 He said I need some time, need some space
 To think about all of this
 and I watched him go
 He watched me crash to the floor
 On my knees just like that
 
 He said when can I come back
 I said, that's when, when I wake up in the morning
 That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
 Laughing when I'm crying
 That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
 That's when I never see your face
 I let you in, baby that's when
 
 I said I know
 He said I did you wrong, made mistakes
 Put you through all of this
 'Cause I let you go, you let me think
 That I'd be fine without you
 Imagine that!
 So baby when can I come back?
 And I said, that's when, when I wake up in the morning
 That's when , when it's sunny or stormin'
 Laughing when I'm crying
 That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
 That's when I never see your face
 I let you in, baby that's when
 And I said all this playing
 Did you ever think of me?
 And he said
 
 that's when, when I woke up in the morning
 that's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
 Laughing when I was crying,
 and that's when you were waiting at the front gate
 that's when, when I saw youR fAce
 You let me in, and baby that's when
 
 that's when ooooooh. ooh oh ooh oh oh
 I said I know
 he said I need some time, need some space
 
 I'm five years old
 It's getting cold
 I've got my big coat on
 
 I hear your laugh
 And look up smiling at you
 I run and run
 Past the pumpkin patch
 And the tractor rides
 Look now, the sky is gold
 I hug your legs
 And fall asleep on the way home
 
 I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
 But I know you're not scared of anything at all
 Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
 But I know I had the best day with you today
 
 I'm thirteen now
 And don't know how
 My friends could be so mean
 I come home crying
 And you hold me tight
 And grab the keys
 
 And we drive and drive
 Until we found a town far enough away
 And we talk and window shop
 'Till I forgotten all their names
 
 I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
 But I know I'm laughing
 On the car ride home with you
 Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
 But I know I had the best day with you today
 
 I have an excellent father
 His strength is making me stronger
 God smiles on my little brother
 Inside and out he's better than I am
 I grew up in a pretty house
 And I had space to run and I
 had the best days with you
 
 There is a video I found
 From back when I was three
 You set up a paint set in the kitchen
 And you're talking to me
 It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
 And the seven dwarfs
 And Daddy's smart
 And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
 
 And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
 I know you were on my side
 Even when I was wrong
 And I love you for giving me your eyes
 Staying back and watching me shine and
 
 I didn't know if you knew
 So I'm taking this chance to say
 That I had the best day with you today.
 
 Find myself at your door,
 Just like all those times before,
 I'm not sure how I got there,
 All roads they lead me here
 
 I imagine you are home,
 In your room, all alone,
 And you open your eyes into mine,
 And everything feels better,
 
 Right before your eyes,
 I'm breaking, no past
 No reasons why,
 Just you and me
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you this,
 Put my name at the top of your list,
 This is the last time I'm asking you why,
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
 
 You find yourself at my door,
 Just like all those times before,
 You wear your best apology,
 But I was there to watch you leave,
 
 And all the times I let you in,
 Just for you to go again,
 Disappear when you come back,
 Everything is better
 
 Right before your eyes,
 I'm aching, no past
 Nowhere to hide,
 Just you and me
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you this,
 Put my name at the top of your list,
 This is the last time I'm asking you why,
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
 
 This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong,
 This is the last time I say it's been you all along,
 This is the last time I let you in my door,
 This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
 
 Oh, oh, oh,
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you this,
 Put my name at the top of your list,
 This is the last time I'm asking you why,
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you this 
 Put my name at the top of your list 
 This is the last time I'm asking you why 
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye 
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you,
 Last time I'm asking you,
 Last time I'm asking you this
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you,
 Last time I'm asking you,
 Last time I'm asking you this
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you,
 Last time I'm asking you,
 Last time I'm asking you this
 
 This is the last time I'm asking you,
 Last time I'm asking you,
 Last time I'm asking you this
 
 New to town with a made up name in the Angel city, chasing fortune and fame
 And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream
 You had it figured out since you were in school
 Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
 So overnight you look like a sixties' queen
 
 Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky
 
 And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
 Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
 But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
 
 Now it's big black cars, and Riviera views,
 And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
 And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
 
 And they tell you that you're lucky
 But you're so confused,
 'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
 And all the young things line up to take your place
 
 Another name goes up in lights
 You wonder if you'll make it out alive
 
 And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
 Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
 Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one,
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 
 It was a few years later, I showed up here
 And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
 How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
 They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
 Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
 And it took some time, but I understand it now
 
 'Cause now my name is up in lights,
 But I think you got it right,
 
 Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
 Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
 Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
 
 Yeah they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
 Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
 And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, whoa, oh, oh
 
 You should've been there,
 Should've burst through the door,
 With that 'baby I'm right here' smile,
 And it would've felt like,
 A million little shining stars had just aligned,
 And I would've been so happy.
 
 Christmas lights glisten,
 I've got my eye on the door,
 Just waiting for you to walk in,
 But the time is ticking,
 People ask me how I've been
 As I comb back through my memory,
 How you said you'd be here,
 You said you'd be here.
 
 And it was like slow motion,
 Standing there in my party dress,
 In red lipstick,
 With no one to impress,
 And they're all laughing,
 As I'm looking around the room,
 But there was one thing missing,
 And that was the moment I knew.
 
 And the hours pass by,
 Now I just wanna be alone,
 But your close friends always seem to know
 When there's something really wrong,
 So they follow me down the hall,
 And there in the bathroom,
 I try not to fall apart,
 And the sinking feeling starts,
 As I say hopelessly,
 "He said he'd be here."
 
 And it was like slow motion,
 Standing there in my party dress,
 In red lipstick,
 With no one to impress,
 And they're all laughing,
 And asking me about you,
 But there was one thing missing,
 And that was the moment I knew.
 
 What do you say
 When tears are streaming down your face
 In front of everyone you know?
 And what do you do when the one
 Who means the most to you
 Is the one who didn't show?
 
 You should've been here.
 And I would've been so happy.
 
 And it was like slow motion,
 Standing there in my party dress,
 In red lipstick,
 With no one to impress,
 And they're all standing around me singing
 "Happy birthday to you",
 But there was one thing missing,
 And that was the moment I knew.
 
 Ooh, I knew.
 Ooh,
 
 You called me later,
 And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
 And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
 And that was the moment I knew.
 
 In the heat of the fight I walked away
 Ignoring words that you were saying
 Trying to make me stay
 I said, 'This time I've had enough'
 And you've called a hundred times
 But I'm not picking up
 'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
 But if you look a little closer
 
 I said leave but all I really want is you
 To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
 Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
 Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
 And don't you leave cause I know
 All I need is on the other side of the door
 
 Me and my stupid pride, sitting here alone
 Going through the photographs
 Staring at the phone
 I keep going back over, things we both said
 And I remember the slamming door
 And all the things that I misread
 So babe if you know everything
 Tell me why you couldn't see
 That when I left I wanted you to chase after me
 
 Yeah, I said leave but all I really want is you
 To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
 Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
 Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
 And don't you leave cause I know
 All I need is on the other side of the door
 
 And I'll scream out the window
 I can't even look at you
 I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
 I say, 'there's nothing you can say
 To make this right again'
 I mean it, I mean it, what I mean I
 
 I said leave but baby all I want is you
 To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
 Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
 Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
 And don't you leave cause I know
 All I need is on the other side of the door
 
 With your face and the beautiful eyes
 And the conversation with the little white lies
 And the faded picture of a beautiful night
 You carried me from your car up the stairs
 And I broke down crying, wish it weren't this mess
 After everything and that little black dress
 After everything I must confess, I need you
 
 I didn't know what I would find
 When I went lookin' for a reason I know
 I didn't read between the lines
 And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
 I tried to take the road less traveled by
 But nothin' seems to work the first few times
 Am I right?
 
 So how can I ever try to be better?
 Nobody ever lets me in
 And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
 On the outside, lookin' in
 I've been a lot of lonely places
 I've never been on the outside
 
 You saw me there, but never knew
 That I would give it all up to be
 A part of this, a part of you
 And now it's all too late, so you see
 You could have helped if you had wanted to
 But no one notices until it's too late to do anything
 
 How could I ever try to be better?
 Nobody ever lets me in
 And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
 On the outside, lookin' in
 I've been a lot of lonely places
 I've never been on the outside
 
 Oh, yeah
 
 How can I ever try to be better?
 Nobody ever lets me in
 And I can still see you; this ain't the best view
 On the outside, lookin' in
 I've been a lot of lonely places
 I've never been on the outside
 
 Oh, oh
 Oh, oh,
 Oh, oh
 Oh, oh
 Oh, oh
 
 I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
 How we met and the sparks flew instantly
 People would say, "they're the lucky ones"
 
 I used to know my place was a spot next to you
 Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
 
 Oh, a simple complication
 Miscommunications lead to fall out
 So many things that I wish you knew
 So many walls up I can't break through
 
 Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room
 And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
 Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
 I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
 When it all broke down and the story of us
 Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter
 
 How'd we end up this way?
 See me nervously pulling at my clothes
 And trying to look busy
 And you're doing your best to avoid me
 I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
 How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
 But you held your pride like you should have held me
 Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
 Why are we pretending this is nothing?
 I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
 I've never heard silence quite this loud
 
 Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
 And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
 Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
 I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
 When it all broke down and the story of us
 Looks a lot like a tragedy now
 
 This is looking like a contest
 Of who can act like they care less
 But I liked it better when you were on my side
 The battle's in your hands now
 But I would lay my armor down
 If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
 So many things that you wish I knew
 But the story of us might be ending soon
 
 Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
 And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
 Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
 I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
 When it all broke down and the story of us
 Looks a lot like a tragedy now, the end
 
 If I could escape 
 I would, but first of all let me say 
 I must apologize for acting, stinking, treating you this way
 Because I've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor 
 It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
 Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold 
 
 If I could escape 
 And recreate a place as my own world 
 And I could be your favorite girl 
 Forever, perfectly together 
 Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 
 
 If I could be sweet 
 I know I've been a real bad girl 
 I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
  We can make it better 
 Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 
 
 (I want to get away
 To our sweet escape
 I want to get away
 Yeah)
 
 You let me down 
 I'm at my lowest boiling point 
 Come help me out 
 I need to get me out of this joint 
 Come on, let's bounce 
 Counting on you to turn me around 
 Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground 
 
 So, baby, times getting a little crazy 
 I've been getting a little lazy 
 Waiting for you to come save me 
 I can see that you're angry 
 By the way the you treat me 
 Hopefully you don't leave me 
 Want to take you with me 
 
 If I could escape 
 And recreate a place as my own world 
 And I could be your favorite girl 
 Forever, perfectly together 
 Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 
 
 If I could be sweet 
 I know I've been a real bad girl 
 I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
  We can make it better 
 Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 
 
 (If I could escape
 If I could escape)
 
 Because I've been acting like sour milk that fell on the floor 
 It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
 Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold 
 
 If I could escape 
 And recreate a place in my own world 
 And I could be your favorite girl 
 Forever, perfectly together 
 Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 
 
 If I could be sweet 
 I know I've been a real bad girl 
 I didn't mean for you to get hurt 
  We can make it better 
 Tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? 
 
 (I want to get away
 To our sweet escape
 I want to get away
 Yeah)
 
 He is sensible and so incredible
 And all my single friends are jealous
 He says everything I need to hear and it's like
 I couldn't ask for anything better
 He opens up my door and I get into his car
 And he says you look beautiful tonight
 And I feel perfectly fine
 
 But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
 And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
 You're so in love that you act insane
 And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
 It's a roller coaster kinda rush
 And I never knew I could feel that much
 And that's the way I loved you
 
 He respects my space
 And never makes me wait
 And he calls exactly when he says he will
 He's close to my mother
 Talks business with my father
 He's charming and endearing
 And I'm comfortable
 
 But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
 And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
 You're so in love that you act insane
 And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
 It's a roller coaster kinda rush
 And I never knew I could feel that much
 And that's the way I loved you
 
 He can't see the smile I'm faking
 And my heart's not breaking
 Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
 And you were wild and crazy
 Just so frustrating intoxicating
 Complicated, got away by some mistake and now
 
 I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
 And it's two a.m. and I'm cursing your name
 I'm so in love that I acted insane
 And that's the way I loved you
 Breakin' down and coming undone
 It's a roller coaster kinda rush
 And I never knew I could feel that much
 And that's the way I loved you
 
 And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
 Never knew I could feel that much
 And that's the way I loved you
 
 Beneath the chandelier of star and atmosphere
 Tangled like the roots on the ground
 The windows open up
 The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
 It's like I'm melting on into you
 Give me a reason why we should ever move 
 and
 
 Tell me 
 You'll never leave me 
 that I'm not crazy
 and this is really happening 
 That this is really happening
 
 Could this be better?
 You write me letters 
 though you see me everyday
 You tend to treat me like
 My name is up in lights 
 It really blows me away 
 
 Lock me up in a dark room
 And I still can't take my eyes off you 
 
 Tell me 
 You'll never leave me 
 and I'm not crazy and
 This is really happening 
 That this is really happening
 
 All those kisses up against your car 
 For all those wishes on planes 
 We thought were stars
 Memories like photographs 
 Oh baby, here we are
 
 Tell me 
 You'll never leave me 
 and I'm not crazy and
 Oh and this is really happening 
 That this is really happening
 Oh,Oh,Baby 
 
 Tell me 
 You'll always need me 
 That I drive you crazy
 And this is really happening
 Oh, that this is really happening
 
 Tell me, Oh
 You'll always need me 
 
 That I drive you crazy
 
 That this is really happening
 
 It was so nice throwing big parties
 Jumping to the pool from the balcony
 Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
 And there are no rules when you show up here
 Bass beat rattling the chandelier
 Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
 
 So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
 I'm shaking my head
 I'm locking the gates
 
 This is why we can't have nice things, darling
 Because you break them
 I had to take them away
 This is why we can't have nice things, honey
 Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
 This is why we can't have nice things
 
 It was so nice being friends again
 There I was giving you a second chance
 But you stabbed my back while shaking my hand
 And therein lies the issue
 Friends don't try to trick you
 Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
 And so I took an axe to a mended fence
 
 But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately, hm hm
 If only you weren't
 So shady
 
 This is why we can't have nice things, darling
 Because you break them
 I had to take them away
 This is why we can't have nice 
 Things  honey
 Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
 This is why we can't have
 
 Here's a toast to my real friends
 They don't care about that he said, she said
 And here's to my baby
 He ain't reading what they call me lately
 And here's to my momma
 Had to listen to all this drama
 And here's to you
 'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
 I can't even say it with a straight face
 
 This is why we can't have nice things, darling 
 Because you break them
 I had to take them away
 This is why we can't have nice things, honey
 Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
 This is why we can't have nice things, darling
 
 Because you break them, I want to take them 
 And here's to my baby
 
 Nice things, honey 
 Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
 This is why we can't have nice things
 
 Clear blue water
 High tide, came and brought you in
 And I could go on and on, on and on
 And I will, skies grow darker, currents swept you out again
 And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
 In silent screams, and wildest dreams
 I never dreamed of this
 
 This love is good
 This love is bad
 This love is a life back from the dead, oh
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me, oh
 Oh, oh
 
 Tossing, turning, struggle through the night for someone new
 And I could go on and on, on and on
 Lanterns burning, flickered in the mind only you
 But you were still gone, gone, gone
 Been losing grip, on sinking ships
 You showed up, just in time
 
 This love is good
 This love is bad
 This love is a life back from the dead, oh
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me, oh
 
 This love left a permanent mark
 This love is glowing in the dark, oh
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me, oh
 
 This love, this love, this love, this love 
 This love, this love, this love, this love 
 This love, this love, this love, this love 
 This love, this love, this love, this love
 
 Your kiss, my cheek
 I watched you leave
 Your smile, my ghost
 I fell to my knees
 When you're young, just to run
 But you come back to what you need
 
 This love is good
 This love is bad
 This love is a life back from the dead, oh
 These hands had to let it go free
 And, this love came back to me, oh
 
  This love that's a permanent mark
  This love is glowing in the dark, oh
  These hands had to let it go free
  And this love came back to me, oh
 
 This love, this love, this love, this love 
 This love, this love, this love, this love 
 This love, this love, this love, this love 
 This love, this love, this love, this love 
 
 I'm like eight foot four, blond hair to the floor
 You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
 
 No I ain't got a gun
 No I never really been in a club
 Still live with my parents
 But I'm still a thug
 
 I'm so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night
 You out clubbing, well I just baked Caramel Delights
 T Swift and T Pain rappin' on the same track
 It's a thug story tell me can you get with that
 
 I had a dream last night I had high-top Nikes
 I had diamonds in my mouth, and diamonds on my mic
 By the time I woke I was singing "I'm on a boat"
 
 'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
 Shorty I'm a make ya
 Straight to the top, yo
 Shorty I'ma take ya
 
 You can call me T Sweezy now I'm a rap star
 Hey it's a thug story now tell them who you are
 
 Singer turned gangsta
 You don't wanna fight me
 Straight to the top
 In my extra small white tee
 
 T Swift and T Pain all up on the same track
 It's a thug story tell now can you get with that
 
 What! what! I knit sweaters yo!
 What! what! don't test me
 
 Hey hold on, hold on I didn't even say anything
 What? I said "yo"
 Yo, you guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
 I didn't even swear
 She didn't even swear
 Hello?  Ugh!
 
 Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
 Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
 You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
 But that's not true 'cause I know you
 
 Hold on, baby; you're losing it
 The water's high, you're jumping into it
 And letting go, and no one knows
 That you cry; but you don't tell anyone
 That you might not be the golden one
 And you're tied together with a smile
 But you're coming undone
 
 I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
 'Cause you're givin' it away like it's extra change
 Hoping it will end up in his pocket
 But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
 Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
 It's not his price to pay
 
 Hold on, baby; you're losing it
 The water's high, you're jumping into it
 And letting go, and no one knows
 That you cry; but you don't tell anyone
 That you might not be the golden one
 And you're tied together with a smile
 But you're coming undone
 
 Hold on, baby; you're losing it
 The water's high, you're jumping into it
 And letting go, and no one knows
 That you cry; but you don't tell anyone
 That you might not be the golden one
 And you're tied together with a smile
 But you're coming undone
 
 You're tied together with a smile
 But you're coming undone, oh
 Goodbye, baby
 With a smile, baby, baby
 
 Do you remember the day
 I leaned up against your car
 And it started rolling down the street
 You screamed and ran after it
 And tried to open the door
 And it ran over your foot
 And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see
 
 It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
 It takes five seconds to need you
 When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
 Because they don't know to play our song
 I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
 I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
 Because that's where you belong
 Until Brad Pitt comes along
 
 Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
 And you said it reminded you of me
 And I threw the remote at you
 And you said, "My point exactly"
 And later on that night, under the neon city lights
 You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me
 
 It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
 It takes five seconds to need you
 When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
 Because they don't know to play our song
 I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
 I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
 Because that's where you belong
 Until Brad Pitt comes along
 
 You call me lucky because I lose everything
 But I swear I'd be careful with it
 If you gave me a ring
 
 And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
 It takes five seconds to need you
 When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
 Because they don't play our song
 I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
 I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
 Because that's where you belong
 Until Brad Pitt comes along
 Until Brad Pitt comes along
 Yeah, oh, oh
 Until Brad Pitt comes along
 
 He said the way my blue eyes shined
 Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
 I said: "That's a lie."
 Just a boy in a Chevy truck
 That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
 On back roads at night
 And I was right there beside him all summer long
 And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone
 
 But when you think "Tim McGraw"
 I hope you think my favorite song
 The one we danced to all night long
 The moon like a spotlight on the lake
 When you think happiness
 I hope you think "that little black dress"
 Think of my head on your chest
 And my old faded blue jeans
 When you think Tim McGraw
 I hope you think of me
 
 September saw a month of tears
 And thankin' God that you weren't here
 To see me like that
 But in a box beneath my bed
 Is a letter that you never read
 From three summers back
 It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
 And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
 
 But when you think "Tim McGraw"
 I hope you think my favorite song
 The one we danced to all night long
 The moon like a spotlight on the lake
 When you think happiness
 I hope you think "that little black dress"
 Think of my head on your chest
 And my old faded blue jeans
 When you think Tim McGraw
 I hope you think of me
 
 And I'm back for the first time since then
 I'm standin' on your street
 And there's a letter left on your doorstep
 And the first thing that you'll read
 
 Is when you think "Tim McGraw"
 I hope you think my favorite song
 Someday you'll turn your radio on
 I hope it takes you back to that place
 When you think happiness
 I hope you think "that little black dress"
 Think of my head on your chest
 And my old faded blue jeans
 When you think Tim McGraw
 I hope you think of me
 
 Oh, think of me
 Mmm
 
 You said the way my blue eyes shined
 Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
 I said, "That's a lie."
 
 Today was a fairytale
 You were the prince
 I used to be a damsel in distress
 You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Today was a fairytale
 I wore a dress
 You wore a dark gray t-shirt
 You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
 Today was a fairytale
 Time slows down whenever you're around
 
 But can you feel this magic in the air?
 It must have been the way you kissed me
 Fell in love when I saw you standing there
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Today was a fairytale
 You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
 Every move you make everything you say is right
 Today was a fairytale
 Today was a fairytale
 All that I can say is now it's getting so much clearer
 Nothin' made sense 'til the time I saw your face
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Time slows down whenever you're around
 Yeah yeah
 
 But can you feel this magic in the air?
 It must have been the way you kissed me
 Fell in love when I saw you standing there
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Time slows down whenever you're around
 I can feel my heart
 It's beating in my chest
 Did you feel it?
 I can't put this down
 
 But can you feel this magic in the air?
 It must have been the way you kissed me
 Fell in love when I saw you standing there
 It must have been the way
 But can you feel this magic in the air?
 It must have been the way you kissed me
 Fell in love when I saw you standing there
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 It must have been the way
 Today was a fairytale
 
 Oh oh yeah yeah oh
 Today was a fairytale
 
 The lies are always better left unsaid
 So take the photos down of the wall
 There's nothing left to talk about
 We're in a plane and I want out
 From all these stories that people tell
 Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
 I guess it feels worse
 Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
 I guess it feels worse
 When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
 When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
 Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
 Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
 Now you know exactly how I feel
 The truth is out and I can see what's real
 There's nothing left to talk about
 We're in a scene and I want out
 From all these stories that people tell
 Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
 I guess it feels worse
 Thinking back I regret never telling you how I felt
 I guess it feels worse
 When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
 When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
 Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
 Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
 Tonight is our last night alone dear
 When you have to pretend you lose the person that you were in life
 When you're trying to fix, you never feel ecstatic and alive
 Well Alright, Tonight is our last night.
 Tonight is our last night
 Tonight is our last night
 Tonight is our last night
 Tonight is our last night
 Tonight is our last night
 Tonight is our last night 
 
 Put your lips close to mine
 As long as they don't touch
 Out of focus, eye to eye
 Till the gravity's too much
 And I'll do anything you say
 If you say it with your hands
 And I'd be smart to walk away,
 But you're quicksand
 
 This slope is treacherous
 This path is reckless
 This slope is treacherous
 And I, I, I like it
 
 I can't decide if it's a choice
 Getting swept away
 I hear the sound of my own voice
 Asking you to stay
 And all we are is skin and bone
 Trained to get along
 Forever going with the flow,
 But you're friction
 
 This slope is treacherous
 This path is reckless
 This slope is treacherous
 I, I, I like it
 
 Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
 And I will get you, and get you alone
 Your name has echoed through my mind
 And I just think you should, think you should know
 That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
 Follow you, follow you home
 I'll follow you, follow you home
 
 This hope is treacherous
 This daydream is dangerous
 This hope is treacherous
 I, I, I I, I, I I, I, I
 
 Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
 And I will get you, and get you alone
 Your name has echoed through my mind
 And I just think you should, think you should know
 That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
 Follow you, follow you home
 I'll follow you, follow you home
 I'll follow you, follow you home
 I'll follow you, follow you home
 
 This slope is treacherous
 I, I, I like it
 
 I remember what you wore on our first date
 You came into my life
 And I thought hey
 You know this could be something
 'Cause everything you do and words you say
 You know that it all takes my breath away
 And now I'm left with nothing
 
 So maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
 Well maybe two is better than one
 There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
 And you've already got me coming undone
 And I'm thinking two, is better than one
 
 I remember every look upon your face,
 The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
 You make it hard for breathing
 'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
 I think of you and everything's okay
 I'm finally now believin'
 
 And maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
 Well maybe two is better than one
 There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
 And you've already got me coming undone
 And I'm thinking two, is better than one
 
 I remember what you wore on the first date
 You came into my life
 And I thought hey
 
 Maybe it's true, that I can't live without you
 Maybe two is better than one
 There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
 And you've already got me coming undone
 And I'm thinking
 
 Oooh I can't live without you
 'Cause baby two is better than one
 There's so much time, to figure out the rest of my life
 And I've figured out with all that's said and done
 Two, is better than one
 
 Two is better than one
 
 You had my heart, we'll never be worlds apart
 Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
 Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
 That's when you need me there, with you I'll always share
 
 Because when the sun shines we'll shine together
 Told you I'll be here forever
 Said I'll always be your friend
 Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
 
 Now that it's raining more than ever
 Know that we'll still have each other
 You can stand under my umbrella
 You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
 Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
 
 Just trying to get your attention
 
 Untouchable like
 A distant diamond sky
 
 I'm reaching out
 And I just
 Can't tell you why
 
 I'm caught up in you
 I'm caught up in you
 
 Untouchable burning
 Brighter than the sun
 And when you're close
 I feel like coming undone
 
 In the middle of the night
 When I'm in this dream
 It's like
 A million little stars
 Spelling out your name
 You gotta come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on
 Little taste of heaven
 
 It's half full
 And I won't wait here
 All day
 I know you're saying
 That you'd be here
 Anyway
 
 But you're
 Untouchable burning
 Brighter than the sun
 Now that you're close
 I feel like coming undone
 
 In the middle of the night
 When I'm in this dream
 It's like
 A million little stars
 Spelling out your name
 You gotta, come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on
 
 In the middle of the night
 Wakin' from this dream
 I wanna feel you
 By my side
 Standing next to me
 You gotta, come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on
 Little taste of heaven
 
 Oh, oh
 Oh, oh
 I'm caught
 Up in you
 Oh, oh
 Oh, oh
 Oh, oh
 
 It's your
 Untouchable burning
 Brighter than the sun
 Now that you're close
 I feel like coming undone
 
 In the middle of the night
 When I'm in this dream
 It's like
 A million little stars
 Spelling out your name
 You gotta come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on
 Oh, oh
 
 In the middle of the night
 When I'm in this dream
 It's like
 A million little stars
 Spelling out your name
 You gotta, come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on
 Come on
 
 In the middle of the night
 We can form this dream
 I wanna feel you by my side
 Standing next to me
 You gotta, come on, come on
 Say that we'll be together
 Come on, come on
 Little taste of heaven
 
 If you had only gotten to me first
 If I could write a book on how this hurts
 You could see the way your smile looks to me
 
 If I wasn't scared of the world alone
 If I didn't know he loves me so
 If I could only find the strength to leave
 You would be with me, so baby
 
 Don't you look in my eyes
 I might fall in love
 With a beautiful boy
 I wish that I could touch
 You go, I hope you think of me
 
 As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
 This girl is begging, wait for me
 
 It's so wrong that all I wanna do
 Is forget it all and just be with you
 I have to go 'cause he don't know
 But the writing's on the wall
 
 But here we are in so deep
 Soaking wet
 Jumping in without no safety net
 And I don't know what kinda ropes
 Would break this kinda fall, so baby
 
 Don't you look in my eyes
 I might fall in love
 With a beautiful boy
 I wish that I could touch
 You go, I hope you think of me
 
 As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
 This girl is begging wait, wait for me
 
 We can't be together right now
 Guess there's no use in trying
 But if you look at me right now
 Can you tell that I'm dying
 To hold you?
 But it would be wrong to
 
 So don't you look in my eyes
 I might fall in love
 With a beautiful boy
 I wish that I could touch
 You go, I hope you think of me
 
 As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
 This girl is begging, wait for me
 
 Don't you look now
 Don't you look now
 I might fall in love
 Don't you look now
 
 I remember when we broke up, the first time
 Saying, this is it, I've had enough
 'Cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month
 When you, said you, needed space 
 Then you come around again and say
 Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
 Remember how that lasted for a day?
 I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
 
 Oh we called it off again last night
 But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
 We are never ever, ever getting back together
 We are never ever, ever getting back together
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
 But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together
 
 Like, ever
 
 I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
 And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
 And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
 With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
 
 Oh, you called me up again tonight
 But oh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 
 We are never ever, ever getting back together
 We, are never ever, ever getting back together
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me 
 But, we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together
 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
 Oh oh oh
 
 I used to think that we were forever ever, ever
 And I used to say, never say never
 Huh, so he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
 And I'm like I just I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
 We are never getting back together like, ever
 
  We are never ever, ever getting back together
 We, are never ever, ever getting back together
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
 But we, are never ever ever ever getting back together
 
 We, are not getting back together,
 We oh, not getting back together
 
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me 
 But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together
 
 We used to walk along the streets
 When the porch lights were shining bright
 Before I had somewhere to be back when we had all night
 And we were happy.
 
 I do recall a good while back we snuck into the circus
 You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
 And we were happy.
 
 When it was good baby, it was good baby
 We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
 Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
 We were gonna buy someday
 We were happy.
 
 We used to watch the sun go down 
 On the boats in the water
 That's sorta how I feel right now
 And goodbye's so much harder
 Because we were happy.
 
 When it was good baby, it was good baby
 We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
 Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
 We were gonna buy someday
 We were happy.
 
 Oh I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
 But they don't give me choices, that's what these tears are for
 'Cause we were happy
 We were happy.
 
 When it was good baby, it was good baby
 We showed 'em all up, no one could touch the way we
 Laughed in the dark talkin' bout your daddy's farm
 And you were gonna marry me
 And we were happy, yeah we were happy.
 Oh, oh. We were happy.
 
 I got a little thing I call self control
 'Cause I get a little crazy 
 When I let too much go
 Love's a little messy and you are too
 Right now I'm scared of both of you
 I laugh and I play and I wasn't gonna stray 
 Swore I'd never let a man in my way
 
 You're the last thing I needed today
 
 And I don't know 
 Where I lost control
 And couldn't take it any longer
 Must have been somewhere between 
 Your smile and the way you say my name
 I can't win so I give in 
 The more I fight it just get's stronger
 You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
 Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
 
 Gone and spilled my coffee 
 Tryna get to the phone
 'Cause it might be you
 You just never know
 Can't talk to my friends 
 Without you coming up
 It's even kind of cute 
 The way you cuss
 I wrote your name down 
 A hundred thousand times
 'Cause it looks so good 
 Right next to mine
 
 You're the last thing I needed tonight
 
 And I don't know 
 Where I lost control
 And couldn't take it any longer
 Must have been somewhere between 
 Your smile and the way you say my name
 I can't win so I give in 
 The more I fight it just get's stronger
 You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
 Welcome distraction
 
 I'm acting like a girl 
 With nothing to lose
 When did I stop caring 
 About anything but you
 
 And I don't know 
 Where I lost control
 And couldn't take it any longer
 Must have been somewhere between 
 Your smile and the way you say my name
 I can't win so I give in 
 The more I fight it just get's stronger
 You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
 
 Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
 Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh oh
 
 Walkin' through a crowd, the village is a glow
 Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
 Everybody here wanted somethin' more
 Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
 And it said
 
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waitin' for you
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waitin' for you
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
 
 It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
 The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waitin' for you
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
 
 When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
 Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
 Everybody here was someone else before
 And you can want who you want
 Boys and boys and girls and girls
 
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waitin' for you
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waitin' for you
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
 
 It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
 The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
 Welcome to New York 
 It's been waitin' for you
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
 
 Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
 Like any real love, it's ever-changing
 Like any true love, it drives you crazy
 But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
 
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waitin' for you
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 It's been waitin' for you
 Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
 
 It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat
 The lights are so bright but they never blind me
 Welcome to New York
 New soundtrack
 It's been waitin' for you
 Welcome to New York
 The lights are so bright but they never blind me
 Welcome to New York
 So bright, they never blind me
 Welcome to New York
 Welcome to New York
 
 I don't like your little games
 Don't like your tilted stage
 The role you made me play
 Of the fool, no, I don't like you
 I don't like your perfect crime
 How you laugh when you lie
 You said the gun was mine
 Isn't cool, no, I don't like you 
 
 But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
 Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
 I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
 I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
 
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 
 I don't like your kingdom keys
 They once belonged to me
 You ask me for a place to sleep
 Locked me out and threw a feast 
 The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
 But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
 And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure 
 Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
 
 But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time 
 Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time 
 I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
 I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
 
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 
 I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
 I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
 I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
 I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
 I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
 I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
 I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
 I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
 
 "I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now" 
 "Why?" 
 "Oh, 'cause she's dead!" 
 
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me
 Ooh, look what you made me do
 Look what you made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 Look what you just made me do
 
 It's this the way it's really going down?
 Is this how we say goodbye?
 Should've known better when you came around
 That you were going to make me cry
 It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
 Because I know that you're living a lie
 That's okay baby, because in time you will find . . .
 
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 What goes around, goes around, goes around
 Comes all the way back around
 
 You don't have to call anymore
 I won't pick up the phone
 This is the last straw
 Don't want to hurt anymore
 And you tell me that you're sorry
 But I don't believe you, baby
 Like I did before
 You're not sorry, goes around
 Oh no, no, no
 Oh no, no, no
 Oh no, no, no 
 
 You're not sorry, oh no, no, no
 
 And every time you call him
 You spend your nights alone
 And he never comes home
 And every time you call him
 All you get's a busy tone
 I heard you found out
 That he's doing to you
 What you did to me
 Girl, you got what you deserved
 
 Shes looking in the mirror
 The moments getting nearer
 She thinks about it as she walks her walk
 Up and down the staircase
 Makeup fresh on her face
 She thinks about it as she talks her talk
 School dance, first chance, always been a dreamer
 Theres one guy, shes shy, sees him through the mirror
 And everybody looks at her,
 She thinks about it
 
 Blue dress angel face, looking in the mirror,
 Shoes,purse, hair tied back and you should see her,
 Shes got her magic, floating through the air,
 
 Peace,Love,One thing leads into another
 Dream big,Aim small
 Man you gotta love her
 She's got her hopes up
 Got 'em up to there
 Wonderin' what to wear
 
 She's standing in her bedroom
 He'll be pullin' up soon
 She thinks about it as she sees headlights
 Looking out the window she's got her diary to show
 That she's been waiting for this all her life
 First date,can't wait
 Lookin' in the mirror
 Heart all wrapped up
 Wait until he sees her
 He's lookin' right at her
 She thinks about it
 
 Sixteen blue jeans Abercrombie t-shirt
 Shoes purse hair tied back and you should see her
 She's got her magic floating through the air
 
 Peace, Love,One thing leads into another
 Dream big, Aim small
 Man you gotta love her
 She's got her hopes up
 Got 'em up to there
 Wonderin' what to wear
 
 The years went by
 The mirror saw her cry
 She got up again
 She got up again
 The wind blew by the small town lights
 She got up again
 
 Move out
 Find out where the world can take her
 Bright lights late nights livin' for the greater
 Move to Paris livin' on a prayer
 
 Peace, Love,One thing leads into another
 Dream big, Aim small
 Man you gotta love her
 She's got her hopes up
 Got 'em up to there
 She's got her hopes up
 Got 'em up to there
 Wonderin' what to wear
 Ooo Ooo
 Wonderin' what to wear
 
 Can you lie next to her
 And give her your heart, your heart
 As well as your body
 And can you lie next to her
 And confess your love, your love
 As well as your folly
 And can you kneel before the king
 And say I'm clean, I'm clean
 
 Chorus:
 But tell me now, where was my fault
 In loving you with all my heart
 Oh tell me now, where was my fault
 In loving you with all my heart
 
 A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
 You did not think when you sent me to the brake, the brake
 You desired my attention but denied my affections, my affections
 
 Chorus
 
 Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
 Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 Just like the ones I used to know
 Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
 To hear sleigh bells in the snow
 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 With every Christmas card I write
 May your days be merry and bright
 And may all your Christmases be white
 
 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 Just like the ones I used to know
 So may your days be merry and bright
 And may all your Christmases be white
 
 May your days be merry and bright
 And may all your Christmases be white
 
 Say you're sorry
 That face of an angel
 Comes out just when you need it to
 As I paced back and forth all this time
 'Cause I honestly believed in you
 Holding on
 The days drag on
 Stupid girl,
 I should have known, I should have known
 
 That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
 I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
 Lead her up the stairwell
 This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
 I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
 Now it's too late for you
 And your white horse, to come around
 
 Maybe I was naive,
 Got lost in your eyes
 And never really had a chance
 My mistake I didn't know to be in love
 You had to fight to have the upper hand
 I had so many dreams
 About you and me
 Happy endings
 Now I know
 
 I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
 I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet,
 Lead her up the stairwell
 This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,
 I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
 Now it's too late for you
 And your white horse, to come around
 
 And there you are on your knees,
 Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
 Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
 
 'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
 I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
 This is a big world, that was a small town
 There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
 And its too late for you and your white horse
 Now its too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now
 
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
 Try and catch me now
 Oh, it's too late
 To catch me now
 
 You walk in here with your guitar, man
 Your shiny boots and your full-on band
 A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
 Singing songs you got to memorize
 With whatever talent money buys
 So polished that it slips right through your hands
 
 Don't worry yourself, I ain't your competition
 Don't flatter yourself, that was never my intention
 
 I want to talk about what you are that I ain't
 Let's talk about what you do that I can't
 Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
 And who wins
 Let's talk about what you did to get here
 Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
 Let's talk about what you want to be
 And who I've always been
 
 I walk in here with a beat-up case
 The same guitar I've always played
 And the words I wrote down on a page
 When I was twelve years old and small town raised
 You tell the crowd you're paying dues
 I'd tell them this is what I do
 And it's what I put my life into
 As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume
 
 They say life on music row is rough conditions
 Oh, but the easy ride was never my ambition
 
 I want to talk about what you are that I ain't
 Let's talk about what you do that I can't
 Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
 And who wins
 Let's talk about what you did to get here
 Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
 Let's talk about what you want to be
 And who I've always been
 
 Let's talk about your childhood days
 You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
 So where's that crown gotten you these days?
 When it's me and you and the same damn games
 So what've you got that I ain't?
 And what do you do that I can't?
 Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
 Let's talk about what you did to get here
 Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
 Let's talk about what you want to be, girl
 And who I've always been
 
 He said, "Let's get out of this town
 Drive out of the city
 Away from the crowds"
 I thought heaven can't help me now
 Nothing lasts forever
 But this is gonna take me down
 He's so tall, and handsome as hell
 He's so bad but he does it so well
 I can see the end as it begins, my one condition is
 
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams 
 Wildest dreams 
 
 I said no one has to know what we do
 His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
 And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
 But this is getting good now
 He's so tall, and handsome as hell
 He's so bad but he does it so well
 And when we've had our very last kiss
 But my last request is
 
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams  
 Wildest dreams 
 
 You see me in hindsight
 Tangled up with you all night
 Burn it down
 Some day when you leave me
 I bet these memories follow you around
 You see me in hindsight
 Tangled up with you all night
 Burnin' it down 
 Some day when you leave me
 I bet these memories follow you around 
 
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend
 
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just  in your wildest dreams 
 In your wildest dreams 
 Even if it's just in your wildest dreams 
 In your wildest dreams 
 
 Flashing lights and we, took a wrong turn and we
 Fell down the rabbit hole
 You held on tight to me
 'Cause nothing's as it seems
 Spinning out of control
 Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
 Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
 Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
 Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
 I felt your arms twisting around me
 I should've slept with one eye opened at night
 
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it
 And we pretended it could last forever, eh
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it
 And life was never worse but never better, eh
 In wonderland, eh
 In wonderland, eh
 In wonderland, eh
 In wonderland
 
 So we went on our way
 Too in love to think straight
 All alone or so it seemed
 But there were strangers watching
 And whispers turned to talking
 And talking turned to screams
 
 Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
 Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
 Didn't you call my fears with the treacherous cat's smile
 Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
 I felt your arms twisting around me
 It's all fun and games, still somebody loses their mind
 
 Oh darling, we found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it
 And we pretended it could last forever, eh
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it
 And life was never worse but never better, eh
 In wonderland, eh
 In wonderland, eh
 In wonderland, eh
  In wonderland
 
 I reach for you
 But you were gone
 I knew I had to go back home
 You searched the world for something else
 To make you feel like what we had
 And in the end in wonderland we both went mad
 
 Oh, we found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it
 And we pretended it could last forever, eh 
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it 
 And life was never worse but never better, eh 
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it 
 And we pretended it could last forever, eh 
 We found wonderland
 You and I got lost in it 
 And life was never worse but never better
 
 In wonderland
 
 I can't believe you did it again, walked by and took my heart with you
 Why'd you have to look so good? 
 Don't you know I'm trying to hate you?
 Trying to have a dream without you in it
 But how can I put out this fire when you're the one who lit it?
 
 I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
 I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
 Until I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.
 
 I've got a stack of papers so high and it's all about you, baby
 Keep thinking maybe I can make sense of something crazy
 Something I can't get out of my head
 I write your name, I write your name 
 Then I tear it all to shreds!
 
 I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
 I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
 Until I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.
 
 And if you ever change your mind and want me back again
 I hope these songs will remind me why I shouldn't let you in.
 
 I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay 'cause I'm not
 I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
 'Til I do I'll just wait for the day that I stop pretending that
 I'm really okay when I'm not
 I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
 'Til I do, I'll keep writing songs about you.
 
 One look, dark room
 Men just for you
 Time moved too fast
 You played it back
 Buttons on a coat
 Light hearted joke
 No proof not much
 But you saw enough
 Small talk, he drives
 Coffee at midnight, the light reflects
 The chain on your neck
 He says look up
 And your shoulders brush
 No proof, one touch
 You felt enough
 
 You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
 You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You are in love
 
 Morning, his place
 Burnt toast, Sunday
 You keep his shirt
 He keeps his word
 And for once you let go
 Of your fears and your ghosts
 One step, not much, but it said enough
 You kissed on sidewalks
 You fight and you talk
 One night he wakes, strange look on his face
 Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
 And you knew what it was, he is in love
 
 You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
 You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 
 So it goes
 You two are dancing in a snow globe, go round and round
 And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
 You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
 And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words
 
 'Cause you can hear in the silence
 You can feel it on the way home
 You can see it with the lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You're in love
 
 You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
 You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You're in love
 You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
 You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You're in love
 
 You're on the phone with your girlfriend
 She's upset
 She's going off about something that you said
 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
 I'm in my room
 It's a typical Tuesday night
 I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
 And she'll never know your story like I do'
 
 But she wears short skirts
 I wear T-shirts
 She's cheer captain
 And I'm on the bleachers
 Dreaming about the day when you wake up
 And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time
 
 If you can see I'm the one who understands you
 Been here all along so why can't you see
 You belong with me
 You belong with me
 
 Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
 I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
 Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
 Hey isn't this easy
 
 And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
 I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
 You say your fine
 I know you better then that
 Hey what you doing with a girl like that
 
 She wears high heels
 I wear sneakers
 She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
 Dreaming about the day when you wake up
 And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time
 
 If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
 Been here all along so why can't you see
 You belong with me
 
 Standing by and waiting at your back door
 All this time how could you not know
 Baby, you belong with me
 You belong with me
 
 Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
 I'm the one who makes you laugh
 When you know you're about to cry
 And I know your favorite songs
 And you tell me about your dreams
 I think I know where you belong
 I think I know it's with me
 
 Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
 Been here all along so why can't you see
 You belong with me
 
 Standing by and waiting at your back door
 All this time
 How could you not know
 Baby you belong with me
 You belong with me
 
 You belong with me
 Have you ever thought just maybe
 You belong with me
 You belong with me
 
 My castle crumbled overnight
 I brought a knife to a gunfight
 They took the crown, but it's alright
 All the liars are calling me one
 Nobody's heard from me for months
 I'm doing better than I ever was, 'cause
 
 My baby's fit like a daydream
 Walking with his head down
 I'm the one he's walking to
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 My baby's fly like a jet stream
 High above the whole scene
 Loves me like I'm brand new
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 
 All my flowers grew back as thorns
 Windows boarded up after the storm
 He built a fire just to keep me warm
 All the drama queens taking swings
 All the jokers dressin' up as kings
 They fade to nothing when I look at him
 And I know I make the same mistakes every time
 Bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right
 I did one thing right
 I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers
 Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right
 Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night
 
 My baby's fit like a daydream
 Walking with his head down
 I'm the one he's walking to
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 My baby's fly like a jet stream
 High above the whole scene
 Loves me like I'm brand new
 
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 
 I want to wear his initial
 On a chain round my neck, chain round my neck
 Not because he owns me
 But 'cause he really knows me
 Which is more than they can say, I
 I recall late November, holdin' my breath
 Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me
 But would you run away with me?"
 Yes 
 
 My baby's fit like a daydream
 Walking with his head down
 I'm the one he's walking to
 
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 My baby's fly like a jet stream
 High above the whole scene
 Loves me like I'm brand new
 
 So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
 
 Call it what you want, yeah
 Call it what you want
 To
 
 People like you always want back the love they gave away
 And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
 The more I think about it now the less I know
 All I know is that you drove us off the road
 
 Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Stay, hey, now you say you want it
 Back now that it's just too late
 Well could've been easy
 All you had to do was stay
 
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 
 Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
 I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
 People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
 But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye
 
 Stay, hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Stay, hey, now you say you want it
 Back now that it's just too late
 Well could've been easy
 All you had to do was stay
 
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay 
 
 Let me remind you this was what you wanted 
 You ended it
 You were all I wanted 
 But not like this
 Not like this
 Not like this
 Oh, all you had to do was stay
 
 Hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Stay, hey, now you say you want it
 Back now that it's just too late
 Well could've been easy
 All you had to do was stay
 
 Hey, all you had to do was stay
 Had me in the palm of your hand
 Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Stay, hey, now you say you want it
 Back now that it's just too late
 Well could've been easy 
 All you had to do was stay
 
 All you had to do was stay 
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay
 All you had to do was stay 
 
 You dont have to call me 
 And say your sorry
 I'm already gone
 
 you dont have to call me
 and break my heart each time
 I try moving on
 
 You dont have to call anymore oh yeah
 You dont have to call baby
 
 All this time I was wasting
 Hoping you would come around
 I've been giving out chances every time
 And all you do is let me down
 And it's taking me this long
 Baby but I figured you out
 And you're thinking we'll be fine again
 But not this time around
 
 You don't have to call anymore
 I won't pick up the phone
 This is the last straw
 Don't wanna hurt anymore
 And you can tell me that you're sorry
 But I don't believe you baby
 Like I did before
 You're not sorry, no no, no no
 
 Looking so innocent
 I might believe you if I didn't know
 Could've loved you all my life
 If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
 And you got your share of secrets
 And I'm tired of being last to know
 And now you're asking me to listen
 Cause it's worked each time before
 
 But you don't have to call anymore
 I won't pick up the phone
 This is the last straw
 Don't wanna hurt anymore
 And you can tell me that you're sorry
 But I don't believe you baby
 Like I did before
 You're not sorry, no no
 
 You're not sorry, no no
 
 You had me crawling for you honey
 And it never would've gone away, no
 You used to shine so bright
 But I watched all of it fade
 
 You don't have to call anymore
 I won't pick up the phone
 This is the last straw there's nothing left to beg for
 And you can tell me that you're sorry
 But I don't believe you baby
 Like I did before you're not sorry
 No, no, no
 
 You're not sorry, no no 
 
 I bet you lie awake at night trying to make up your sweet mind 
 wonderin if you'll ever find just what you want 
 a hometown number one 
 or a california loaded gun
 but you you'll only get one 
 ohh thats what you thought 
 and heres what you got
 
 i could be your baby blue jeans 
 with the holes in the knees
 in the bottom of the top drawer 
 i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
 or the girl living next door
 i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
 if thats what you need 
 i'd give everything to be your anyhting 
 be your anything
 
 if you want hard to get 
 if you want 
 all you have to do is let me know
 if you want a bumby ride 
 or someone with a softer side 
 either one will be alright 
 just let me know
 cause this is how it goes 
 
 i could be your baby blue jeans 
 with the holes in the knees
 
 in the bottom of the top drawer 
 i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
 or the girl living next door
 i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
 if thats what you need 
 i'd give everything to be your anyhting 
 
 it's not like i'm giving up who i am for you
 but with someone like you it's so easy to do
 and 
 
 i could be your baby blue jeans 
 with the holes in the knees
 in the bottom of the top drawer 
 i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
 or the girl living next door
 i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
 if thats what you need 
 thats what you need 
 
 i could be your baby blue jeans 
 with the holes in the knees
 in the bottom of the top drawer 
 i could be a little beauty queen just a little out of reach 
 or the girl living next door
 i'll be your angel giving up her wings 
 if thats what you need 
 i'd give everything to be your anyhting 
 
 i heard a song tonight on the radio
 another girl sings about a boy
 she sees his face in every space, every room
 and i know that if i turn around you won't be there
 if i close my eyes will you be there?
 
 i don't wanna lose your face
 i don't wanna wake up one day
 and not remember what time erased
 and i don't wanna turn around
 cause i'm not scared of 
 what love gave me and took away
 and i don't wanna lose your face
 
 i've got a picture of you in my bedroom
 and i hope it never falls
 i hope i never lose that feelin'
 i used to get when you called
 and i wonder to myself
 who were you? where are you? were you ever here at all?
 
 i don't wanna lose your face
 i don't wanna wake up one day
 and not remember what time erased
 and i don't wanna turn around
 cause i'm not scared of 
 what love gave me and took away
 and i don't wanna lose your face
 
 that girl in the song had it so good
 i wish i could close my eyes and see you
 i wish the sky had your face 
 and the oceans has your eyes
 and the sun that had your lips
 and i had you, ohhhh yeah
 
 i don't wanna lose your face
 i don't wanna wake up one day
 and not remember what time erased
 and i don't wanna turn around
 cause i'm not scared of 
 what love gave me and took away
 and i don't wanna lose your face
 ohhh, no, no
 
 i don't wanna lose your face
 i don't wanna turn around
 oh oh oh oh, yeah
 oh, oh, ohhhh
 oh, oh, ohhhh
 oh, oh, ohhhh yeah
 
 I'll sweep out your chimney 
 Yes and, I will bring you flowers
 Yes and, I will do for you
 Most anything you want me to
 
 If we live in a cottage
 You will feel like it's a castle
 By the royal way you're treated
 And attention shown to you
 
 I'll be there beside you
 If you need a cryin' shoulder
 Yes, and I'll be there to listen
 When you need to talk to me
 
 When you wake up in the darkness
 I will put my arms around you
 And hold you 'til the mornin' sun 
 Comes shinin' through the trees
 
 I'll be right beside you
 No matter where you travel
 I'll be there to cheer you
 'Til the sun comes shinin through
 
 If we're ever parted 
 I will keep the tie that binds us
 And I'll never let it break
 'Cause I love you 
 
 I will bring you honey
 From the bee tree in the meadow
 And the first time there?s a rainbow
 I'll bring you a pot of gold
 
 I'll take all your troubles
 And I'll throw 'em in the river
 Then I'll bundle down beside you
 And I'll keep you from the cold
 
 I'll be right beside you
 No matter where you travel
 I'll be there to cheer you
 Till the sun comes shinin through
 
 If we're ever parted 
 I will keep the tie that binds us
 And I'll never let it break
 'Cause I love you
 
 An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
 Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
 When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
 A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw
 
 Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
 Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
 A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
 For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry
 
 Yippie yi ooh
 Yippie yi yay
 Ghost riders in the sky
 
 Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
 He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
 'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
 On horses snorting fire
 As they ride on hear their cry
 
 As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
 If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
 Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
 Trying to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies
 
 Yippie yi ooh
 Yippie yi yay
 
 Ghost riders in the sky
 Ghost riders in the sky
 Ghost Riders in the sky
 
 I was riding Number Nine
 Heading south from Caroline
 I heard that lonesome whistle blow
 
 Got in trouble, had to roam
 Left my gal an' left my home
 I heard that lonesome whistle blow
 
 Just a kid, acting smart
 I went and broke my darling's heart
 I guess I was too young to know
 
 They took me off the Georgia Main
 Locked me to a ball and chain
 I heard that lonesome whistle blow
 
 All alone, I bear the shame
 I'm a number, not a name
 I heard that lonesome whistle blow
 
 All I do is sit an' cry
 When the evening train goes by
 I heard that lonesome whistle blow
 
 I'll be locked here in this cell
 'Till my body's just a shell
 An' my hair turns whiter than snow
 
 I'll never see that gal of mine
 Lord, I'm in Georgia doing time
 I heard that lonesome whistle blow
 
 Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
 But I must go alone
 Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
 Well the morning's so bright
 And the lamp is alight
 And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes
 
 There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
 There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
 There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
 No trouble I see
 There will be peace in the valley for me, for me
 
 Well the bear will be gentle
 And the wolves will be tame
 And the lion shall lay down with the lamb, oh yes
 And the beasts from the wild
 Will be lit by a child
 And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes
 
 There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
 There will be peace in the valley for me, dear Lord I pray
 There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
 No trouble I see
 There will be peace in the valley for me, for me
 
 Well they're building a gallows outside my cell
 And I've got 25 minutes to go
 And the whole town's waitin' just to hear me yell
 I got 24 minutes to go
 Well they gave me some beans for my last meal
 With 23 minutes to go
 But nobody asked me how I feel
 I got 22 minutes to go
 Well I sent for the governor and the whole dern bunch
 With 21 minutes to go
 And I sent for the mayor but he's out to lunch
 I've got 20 more minutes to go
 Then the sheriff said boy I gonna watch you die
 With 19 minutes to go
 So I laughed in his face and I spit in his eye
 With 18 minutes to go
 Now hear comes the preacher for to save my soul
 With 13 minutes to go
 And he's talking bout' burnin' but I'm so cold
 12 more minutes to go
 Well they're testin' the trap and it chills my spine
 11 more minutes to go
 And the trap and the rope aw they work just fine
 10 more minutes to go
 Well I'm waitin' for the pardon that'll set me free
 With 9 more minutes to go
 But this ain't the movies so forget about me
 8 more minutes to go
 With my feet on the trap and my head on the noose
 5 more minutes to go
 Won't somebody come and cut me loose
 7 more minutes to go
 I can see the mountains I can see the skies
 With 3 more minutes to go
 And it's to dern pretty for a man that don't want to die
 2 more minutes to go
 I can see the buzzards I can hear the crows
 1 more minute to go
 And now I'm swingin' and here I go!
 
 Thank you very much. I'm going to do another song here,
 Featuring the harmonica, eh
 And then I want to get the stool there and sit down and do some, uh
 Slow ballad type songs that we wanted to do for this album
 And especially for you.
 What I do with my list over there. My idiot sheet
 Oh, hit the floor.
 How ya doing Shirley?
 
 Hello, I'm Johnny Cash
 One night I had a backstage pass
 To a Willie Nelson show
 
 There were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
 And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
 There was leather and lace and every minority race
 With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show
 
 Kristofferson got an offer for a movie
 Promoters closed another deal or two
 Waylon got a call from his son Shooter
 And he went home the minute he was through
 
 I moved with the mob at intermission
 To the green room where you see who you can see
 There were has-been's and would-be's and never-were's
 Paupers, punks and millionaires and me
 
 And there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
 And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
 There was leather and lace and every minority race
 With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show
 
 Hell's Angels blocked the traffic to the building
 In order for the beer truck to come through
 And waitin' in the wings to sing with Willie
 Were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude
 
 There was a singer Willie knew back in the fifties
 Who once paid him fifty dollars for a song
 There were women who once did and some who still would
 I heard one ask, "Did Connie come along?"
 
 And there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes
 And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe
 Leather and lace and every minority race
 With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show
 
 I wish, you could've been there
 But maybe you were
 
 Thank you
 Well my daddy left home when I was three
 Didn't leave much to my mom and me
 Except this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
 Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid
 But the meanest thing that my daddy ever did
 Was before he left, he went and named me Sue
 
 He must've thought that it was quite a joke
 And I got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
 Seems I had to fight my whole life through
 Some gal would giggle and I'd turn red
 And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
 I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue
 
 Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
 My fist got hard and my wits got keener
 Roam from town to town to hide my shame
 But I made me a vow to the moon and stars
 I'd search the honky tonks and bars
 And kill that man that gave me that awful name
 
 Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
 And I just hit town and my throat was dry
 Thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
 At an old saloon on a street of mud
 There at a table, dealing stud
 Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue
 
 Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
 From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
 Knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
 He was big and bent and gray and old
 And I looked at him and my blood ran col
 And I said, "my name is Sue, how do you do?
 Now you gonna die"
 
 Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
 And he went down, but to my surprise
 He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
 Then I busted a chair right across his teeth
 And we crashed through the walls and into the street
 Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer
 
 Well I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
 But I really can't remember when
 He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
 I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
 And he reached for his gun but I pulled mine first
 He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile
 
 And he said, "son, this world is rough
 And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
 And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
 So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
 And I knew you'd have to get tough or die
 It's that name that helped to make you strong"
 
 He said, "now you just fought one heck of a fight
 And I know you hate me, and you got the right
 To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
 But y ought to thank me, before I die
 For the gravel in ya gut and the spit in ya eye
 'Cause I'm the, that named you Sue"
 
 What could I do?  
 I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
 I called him my pa, and he called me his son
 Come away with a different point of view
 And I think about him, now and then
 Every time I try and every time I win
 And if I ever have a boy, I'll name him
 Bill or George or Frank, anything but Sue, Petor, I hate that name, thank you
 
 
 The only thing that'll move me now is a fast song 
 sung long and barreling on
 And I don't wanna hear no crying all gone wrong song. 
 Kick it off and let's all pick a fast song. 
 Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune, 
 stay away from all that moon and june spoon croon tune. 
 Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on. 
 I'll come in on my part on a fast song.
 
 Well it don't have to have a banjo or mandolin but let it in, if it wants in. 
 Keep the rosin handed and the horsehair tough and tight. 
 Pick it up and I'm liable to pick all night. 
 Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune, 
 stay away from all that moon and spoon june croon tune. 
 Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on. 
 I'll come in on my part on a fast song. 
 Now don't go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune, 
 stay away from all that moon and spoon june croon tune. 
 Throw me one that's flying and I'll hang on. 
 I'll come in on my part on a fast song. 
 
 Now you know some fellahs, they want fame and fortune
 Yeah, and other fellahs they just wanna swing
 But all I wanted all my life
 Was a TV set and a truck and a wife
 And a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.
 
 Yeah the TV and the truck I got on credit.
 And I got that girl with a little old Woolworth ring
 And life was warm and life was sweet
 But still, it was kinda incomplete
 Without a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.
 
 chorus:
 Hey, John you walk the line,
 Do "Deelia" one more time
 And when you do them Cottonfields
 You warm this heart of mine.
 
 So, one day I thought, Hey, I'm gonna do it!
 
 So, I mortgaged the farm and pawned her wedding ring.
 I sold the gold tooth out of my mouth
 And jumped in the pickup and headed South.
 For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.
 
 I hit Nashville cold and wet and hungry.
 I said, "I'm here, bring him on let him do his thing."
 But they told me down at the Old Pit Grill
 I'd have to go all the way to Andersonville
 For a front row seat to hear ole Jonny sing.
 
 I found his house knocked on the door and it was opened
 By a brown-haired girl and a baby with a teethin' ring.
 I said "I seen you somewhere before
 But don't stand there and block the door
 I want a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing."
 
 She said I'd have to go down to The Opry
 And the feller there said I'd have to wait till Spring.
 He said, "We've been sold out for months and months
 And this poor insane fellah wants
 A front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing."
 
 Well, he said a couple more things, and I started cryin'
 And then he laughed at me and that's when I started to swing.
 Well I bust through the doors in a roaring rage,
 Crawled over the crowd till I reached the stage
 For a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.
 
 Then some crazy guard started shootin'
 I shot back, and the next thing I know I was winged
 And on the floor
 When a guy in a voice kinda deep and low
 Says, "Boy that's a mighty long way to go
 For a front row seat to hear ANYBODY sing."
 
 And I guess that judge, he weren't no music lover.
 I got fifteen months but that don't mean a thing.
 'cause' yesterday in the prison yard
 A show come through and HAR! de HAR!
 I had a front row seat to hear ole Johnny sing.
 
 I'm comin' Lord, for my heavenly reward
 I'm comin' home to you, can you see me comin' thru
 Thru clouds of persecution, and stumblin' on my way
 I 'spect I'm only makin', 'bout a half a mile a day
 
 The road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,
 It's one way with no changes heading to the promised land
 But I believe that if I'll heed the things He had to say,
 Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day
 
 Lord, when I let you lead, I never make much speed
 "Cause I have to stop and touch, the ones who need so much
 Then sometimes others pull me, off of Your narrow way
 And by my mistakes, I barely make, a half a mile a day
 
 The road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,
 It's one way with no changes heading to the promised land
 But I believe that if I'll heed the things He had to say,
 Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day
 
 If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game,
 I'd be a legend in my time.
 If they gave gold statuettes for tears and regrets,
 I'd be a legend in my time.
 
 But they don't give awards, and there's no praise or fame
 For a broken heart that's been broken over love that's in vain.
 
 If loneliness meant world acclaim,
 Then everyone would know my name
 I'd be a legend in my time.
 
 How many times have
 You heard someone say
 If I had his money
 I could do things my way
 
 But little they know
 That it's so hard to find
 One rich man in ten
 With a satisfied mind
 
 Once I was waitin'
 In fortune and fame 
 Everything that I dreamed for
 To get a start in life's game 
 
 Then suddenly it happened
 I lost every dime 
 But I'm richer by far
 With a satisfied mind 
 
 Money can't buy back
 Your youth when you're old
 Or a friend when you're lonely
 Or a love that's grown cold
 
 The wealthiest person
 Is a pauper at times
 Compared to the man
 With a satisfied mind
 
 When my life has ended
 And my time has run out
 My friends and my loved ones
 I'll leave there's no doubt
 
 But one thing's for certain
 When it comes my time
 I'll leave this old world
 With a satisfied mind
 
 How many times have
 You heard someone say
 If I had his money
 I could do things my way
 
 But little they know
 That it's so hard to find
 One rich man in ten
 With a satisfied mind
 
 Six foot six he stood on the ground
 He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds
 But I saw that giant of a man brought down
 To his knees by love
 
 He was the kind of man that would gamble on luck
 Look you in the eye and never back up
 But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup
 Because of love
 
 You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
 But like the wind it covers our land
 Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
 This thing called love
 It can lift you up never let you down
 Take your world and turn it around
 Ever since time nothing's ever been found
 That's stronger than love
 
 Most men are like me, they struggle and doubt
 They trouble their minds day in and day out
 Too busy with livin' to worry about
 A little word like love
 
 But when I see a mother's tenderness
 As she holds her young close to her breast
 Then I think god that the world's been blessed
 With a thing called love
 
 You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
 But like the wind it covers our land
 Strong enough to rule the heart of any man
 This thing called love
 It can lift you up never let you down
 Take your world and turn it around
 Ever since time nothing's ever been found
 That's stronger than love
 
 
 
 Every town has its town bum
 I guess ours had one
 Here's a song about him, I remember him fondly
 Well his name was Abner Brown
 
 I knew an old drunk named Abner Brown
 And nobody knew when he came to town
 But he spread good will to his fellow men
 And they let him sleep in the cotton gin
 
 He could drink more brew than an army could
 But he had more friends and he did more good
 Than a lot of fine fancy people in our town
 So they tolerated Abner Brown
 
 And all us kids were on his side
 'Cause he told us tales till our eyes grew wide
 And he made us feel bout ten feet tall
 'Cause he had no kids but he claimed us all
 
 And after school and on weekends
 You could find me down at the cotton gin
 The truest friend that I ever found was
 A good old drunk named Abner Brown
 
 Abner Brown, I wish that I could see you once again
 I believe that you'd stack up with all the mighty men
 I've met and known in all the low
 And higher places that I've been
 
 Thinking of you picks me up when I'm feeling down
 I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown
 
 Lord take me back to the cotton land
 To Arkansas take me home again
 Let me be the boy that I once have been
 Let me walk that road to the cotton gin
 
 He's probably dead many years ago
 And gone the way that old drunks go
 But I'd still like to sit me down
 Talk to my old friend, Abner Brown
 
 Abner Brown, I wish
 I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown
 
 Accidentally I saw you this morning you were lovely dressed in your wedding gown 
 And they say that you married a stranger to me that had drifted to our old hometown 
 Accidentally you've met him one evening and you say it was love at first sight 
 Accidentally on purpose you've married accidentally on purpose for spite 
 Cause I saw out cheating and running around 
 And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown 
 Accidentally you were mistaken that night accidentally on purpose for spite 
 
 Cause I saw out cheating
 
 We have drifted apart
 Broken hearts, me and you
 After all of this time
 I'm satisfied inside to know
 
 This memory that I had
 It's more good than bad
 You taught me how to sing
 And bring you love
 
 After all this time
 You're still a friend of mine
 So I believe in someone
 After all
 
 Our love didn't last long
 What went wrong?
 Who's to say?
 
 If you never been by
 How then could I
 Begin to say
 
 After all this time
 And you're still a friend of mine
 So I believe in someone
 After all
 
 After all this time
 You're still a friend of mine
 So I believe in someone
 After all
 
 I feel so good come payday
 I think of all the things I'm gonna buy 
 When I pick up my pay
 
 Don't you know, but then they hand me that little brown envelope
 I peep inside, Lord I lose all hope
 
 'Cause from those total wages earned
 Down to that net amount that's due
 I feel the painful sense of loss between the two
 
 There goes that bracelet for her arm
 There goes that new fence for my farm
 There goes that brand new Pontiac
 There goes the shirt right off my back
 
 You can dream about a honeymoon for two
 You can dream but that's about all you can do
 'Cause by the time old uncle Sam gets through with you
 
 You can buy her a pair of hose
 A little powder for her nose
 And take her down to Sloppy Joe's for beer and stew 
 Them are the facts after tax
 
 You can dream about vacation in the sun
 You can dream but you can't never have one
 'Cause by the time your good old uncle Sam gets done
 
 You've got just enough for gas
 To see them city limits pass
 And if you get back home fourth class I'd say you won
 
 There goes that bracelet for her arm
 There goes that new fence for my farm
 Send back that short wave radio 
 Cancel that trip to Mexico
 Forget that brand new Pontiac
 There goes the shirt right off my back
 
 I hear people laughing on the corner, by the square
 The neon flickers on my wall and I know you're out there
 I've been in here a listening for your footsteps down the hall
 And I'll be waiting for you after the ball
 
 After the ball is over, after the ball
 If you cannot stand, I've got a place for you to fall
 The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock-face to the wall
 I'll be waiting for you after the ball
 
 Loving you is sweet addiction, I need only you
 Just as long as you come back we'll do what you want to
 Give the night your laughter but I'll have you after all
 I'll be waiting for you after the ball
 
 After the ball is over, after the ball
 If you cannot stand, I've got a place for you to fall
 The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock-face to the wall
 I'll be waiting for you after the ball
 
 After the ball is over, after the ball
 If you cannot stand, I've got a place for you to fall
 The blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock-face to the wall
 I'll be waiting for you after the ball
 
 WAYLON:
 It seems like yesterday, but it was a long time ago
 She was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
 There in the darkness with the radio, playin' low
 The secrets that we shared, the mountains that we moved
 Caught like a wildfire out of control
 There was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove
 JOHNNY:
 And I remember what she said to me
 How she swore that it would never end
 I remember how she held me oh, so tight
 Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
 CHORUS :
 Against the wind
 We were running against the wind
 We were young and strong
 But just running against the wind
 WILLIE:
 And the years rolled slowly past, I found myself alone
 Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
 I found myself further and further from my home
 I guess I lost my way, there were oh, so many roads
 I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
 Never worrying about paying or how much I owed
 Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
 Breakin' all of the rules I could bend
 I began to find myself searchin'
 Searchin' for shelter again and again
 CHORUS :
 Against the wind
 We were running against the wind
 I found myself seekin'
 Shelter against the wind
 WILLIE:
 All those drifter's days are passed me now
 I've got so much more to think about
 JOHNNY:
 Deadlines and commitments
 What to leave in, what to leave out
 CHORUS :
 Against the wind
 We were running against the wind
 Well I'm older now and still
 Running against the wind
 Against the wind
 Against the wind
 Against the wind
 
 There ain't no grave can hold my body down
 There ain't no grave can hold my body down
 When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna rise right out of the ground
 Ain't no grave can hold my body down
 
 Well, look way down the river, what do you think I see?
 I see a band of angels and they're coming after me
 Ain't no grave can hold my body down
 There ain't no grave can hold my body down
 
 Well, look down yonder Gabriel, put your feet on the land and see
 But Gabriel don't you blow your trumpet 'til you hear it from me
 There ain't no grave can hold my body down
 Ain't no grave can hold my body down
 
 Well, meet me Jesus, meet me. Meet me in the middle of the air
 And if these wings don't fail me I will meet you anywhere
 Ain't no grave can hold my body down
 There ain't no grave can hold my body down
 
 Well, meet me mother and father, meet me down the river road
 And momma you know that I'll be there when I check in my load
 Ain't no grave can hold my body down
 There ain't no grave can hold my body down
 There ain't no grave can hold my body down
 
 Just a broken down cowboy all down on his luck
 He's been through the best of his friends
 On a long lonesome highway and an old pickup truck
 Crossed Texas with a hot dusty wind
 He was all around cowboy 1959 from the top it's been a long way down
 Since the whiskey and ladies started winning his time
 
 They rode him high and hard to the ground
 But he remembers the thrill of bein' a winner
 And the feeling of bein' a beginner in the days of his first rodeo
 But there was something about winning that didn't last forever
 But tomorrow it's bound to get better he'll be the all around cowboy again
 
 The windmills're turning on the west Texas plains but he's dry as an old river bed
 He's just like the dust that's a searching for rain but he knows he'll be ridin' again
 So he rolls up a smoke and he sips his Old Crow
 Whipes the whiskers that cover his chin
 He grins as he dreams of the next rodeo to be the all around cowboy again
 But he remembers the thrill
 
 Well, I asked an old truck driver
 About life out on the road
 If he does a lotta singing
 When he's bringing in his load
 
 If there's a pretty waitress crying for him
 Every hundred miles
 If he gets a lotta loving
 If he has a lot of smiles
 
 And I asked him if those trucking songs
 Tell about a life like his
 He said, if you want to know the truth about it
 Here's the way it is
 
 All I do is drive, drive, drive
 Try to stay alive
 And keep my mind on my load
 Keep my eye upon the road
 
 I got nothin' in common with any man
 Who's home every day at five
 All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
 
 Well, we shared a cup of coffee
 Then I had to warm it up
 And his greasy fingers trembled
 As he held onto the cup
 
 And I said, don't you hear a lot of music
 See a lot of sights
 But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry
 Saturday night
 
 I will dedicate you a trucking song
 To which you can relate
 He said, you just do the singing
 And I'll do the driving mate
 
 All I do is drive, drive, drive
 Try to stay alive
 And keep my mind on my load
 Keep my eye upon the road
 
 I got nothin' in common with any man
 Who's home every day at five
 All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive
 
 If I can get the fuel
 Fuel
 
 There was an old woman that lived in a shoe
 She had so many children, she didn't know what to do
 They were doin' all right, 'till she took 'em to town
 The kids started pickin' 'em up and puttin' 'em down
 
 Now all your children wanna rock, mama
 All your children want to roll
 They wanna roll, wanna rock, wanna bop till they pop
 All your children want to rock
 
 Well, we're not tryin' to live too fast
 And we might as well try to live in class
 Better move out before the rent comes due
 'Cause we wanna live in a blue suede shoe
 
 All your children want to rock, mama
 All your children wanna rock
 Wanna roll, wanna rock, wanna bop 'till they pop
 All your children want to rock
 
 Well, every night when it's quiet and still
 You can hear it echoing through the hill
 From a blue suede shoe on a mountain top
 All of mama's children are doin' the bop
 
 All your children wanna rock, mama
 All your children want to roll
 They wanna roll, wanna rock, wanna bop 'till they pop
 All your children want to rock
 
 Well, all your children wanna rock, mama
 All your children wanna roll
 They wanna roll, wanna rock, wanna bop 'till they pop
 All your children want to rock
 
 
 Every time I look at you I fall in love
 All over again
 Every time I think of you it all begins
 All over again
 
 One little dream at night and I can dream all day
 It only takes a memory to thrill me
 One little kiss from you and I just fly away
 Pour me out your love until you fill me
 
 I wanna fall in love beginning from the start
 All over again
 Show me how you stole away my heart
 All over again
 
 One little dream at night and I can dream all day
 It only takes a memory to thrill me
 One little kiss from you and I just fly away
 Pour me out your love until you fill me
 
 I wanna fall in love beginning from the start
 All over again
 Show me how you stole away my heart
 All over again
 
 All over again
 All over again
 All over again
 All over again
 
 Proudly swept the rain cloud by the cliffs, 
 As on it glided through the trees 
 Still following ever the "liko" 
 The "Ahihi lehua" of the vale
 
 Farewell to thee, 
 Farewell to thee, 
 Thou charming one who dwellst among the bow'rs. 
 One fond embrace, 
 Before I now depart, 
 Until we meet again.
 
 Thus sweet memories come back to me, 
 Bringing fresh remembrance of the past 
 Dearest one, yes, thou art mine own, 
 From thee, true love shall ne'er depart.
 
 I have seen and watched thy loveliness, 
 Thous sweet Rose of Maunawili, 
 And 'tis there the birds oft love to dwell 
 And sip the honey from thy lips.
 
 My two cents worth:
 
 Always alone alone and blue I've got no one to tell my troubles to
 No one to care to call my own it seems that I must always be alone
 
 The day you left you broke my heart I need you so but we're so far apart
 You didn't care I should have known that you would go and leave me all alone
 
 There is no one to take your place each night in dreams I see your smiling face
 Then I awake and find you gone I know that I must always be alone
 
 Maybe I didn't love you
 Quite as often as I could have
 Maybe I didn't treat you
 Quite as good as I should have
 If I made you feel second best
 Girl I'm sorry I was blind
 
 But you were always on my mind
 You were always on my mind
 
 Maybe I didn't hold you
 All those lonely, lonely times
 I guess I never told you
 That I am so happy that you're mine
 If I made you feel second best
 Girl I'm sorry I was blind
 
 But you were always on my mind
 You were always on my mind
 
 Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
 Give me, give me one more chance
 To keep you satisfied
 I'll keep you satisfied
 
 Little things I should have said and done
 I just never took the time
 But you were always on my mind
 You were always on my mind  
 You were always on my mind  
 You were always on my mind
 
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me 
 I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see 
 Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved 
 
 How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed 
 When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun 
 We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun
 
 Little baby  in the manger  king Jesus 
 At the temple  there they found him 
 Teachin' the elders 
 Poor Lazerus  didn't bear it  up a walkin' 
 Yeah amen amen amen amen amen amen
 Lord Jesus  up in heaven  who'll be returnin' 
 Amen amen amen amen amen amen
 Shout it children  let me hear you  hallelujah 
 Sing it children  sing amen  amen one more time amen amen amen
 
 Just walk on out the door it's all over
 Forgiving you is just a waste of time
 I don't believe that I'll live to regret it
 'Cause you're ancient history to this heart of mine
 
 So many times I've heard the same old story
 Any fool can learn to read between the lines
 And this time honey you've burned all your bridges
 You're ancient history to this heart of mine
 
 I've marked you down as just another lonely page
 In the book of heartaches that you'll leave behind
 'Cause I've found out I'm better off without you
 You're ancient history to this heart of mine
 I've marked you down
 
 There was a man whose deeds were dark as night
 And quite by chance he rode into the light
 A man, wild as a dust devil with, no place to run
 Livin' by his wits and by his gun
 
 He met a girl like none he'd ever known
 She cared not for the wild oats he had sewn
 And, so, he laid his gun down and set his spirit free
 Began livin' in respectability
 
 But his old ways of thinkin' wouldn't die
 Could not forget the old creed he lived by
 And the good and bad and the right and wrong kept fightin' for his soul
 Till his heart and mind both went out of control
 
 But now the old saloon had lost its spell
 What once was laughter now was livin' hell
 And the hookers, guns and drinkin' in his life were out of place
 And in his mind he saw an Angel's face
 
 So, he burned all his bridges in a day
 And the Devil deeds were done and laid away
 And he rode out a better man than when he first rode in
 And the Angel got the Badman in the end
 
 
 Another man done gone  
 Another man done gone another man done gone another man done gone 
 Another man done gone (another man done gone 
 Another man done gone another man done gone) 
 He had a long chain on (he had a long chain on 
 He had a long chain on he had a long chain on) 
 They hung him in a tree they hung him in a tree 
 They let his children see they let his children see 
  when he was hangin' dead 
 The captain turn his head the captain turn his head 
 He's from the county farm (he's from the county farm 
 He's from the county farm he's from the county farm) 
 I didn't know his name (I didn't know his name 
 I didn't know his name I didn't know his name) 
 Another man done gone another man done gone another man done gone 
 Another man done gone (another man done gone 
 Another man done gone another man done gone) 
 Another man done gone another man done gone another man done gone
 
 Do they ask you where I am or where I've been
 Do they ever say where is the lonely friend
 Is my name whispered in your bedside prayers
 Do you feel a vacant spot beside you there
 
 Well there's always one more path that I must walk
 And there's people I should sit down with and talk
 And somebody might appreciate the flowers I could bring
 So there's always another song to sing
 
 Do you tell them I was wilder than the wind
 Do you remember that I needed lots of friends
 And at other times I'd rather be alone
 Where I could not be found when I was gone
 
 Well there's always one more canyon to explore
 To touch the things left by those gone before
 At the top of the tiniest hill I can feel like I'm a king
 And there's always another song to sing
 
 Hmmmm
 
 Lord, she's restless,
 Like cotton candy clouds that sail the day,
 Slow and free.
 And she possesses,
 
 A mind that can't resign itself to stay,
 For long with me
 Though I've tried and tried to keep her tied and satisfied,
 Until she really needs me,
 
 Yes I do,
 But when that certain look comes on her face,
 I can't replace it,
 And she leaves me.
 
 She's butterfly in mid July who just can't wait to try her brand new wings.
 On brand new things.
 And she needs no rhyme or reason when she goes.
 Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon, I suppose:
 
 And Heaven knows
 She'll go sailin' off on any old wind that blows.
 Yes, she will; 
 Yes, she will.
 She'll go sailin' off on any old wind that blows.
 
 Hmm
 
 I know she needs me,
 About as much as I need someone else,
 Which I don't.
 And if need be,
 
 I swear someday I'll up and leave myself,
 Which I won't.
 Even if she loved another man,
 I'd understand it more than I do.
 
 Hhmm.
 But I know the only reason,
 That she ever has for leavin',
 Is she wants to
 
 She's butterfly in mid July who just can't wait to try her brand new wings.
 On brand new things.
 And she needs no rhyme or reason when she goes.
 Her mind is on what lies beyond that wall of blue horizon, I suppose:
 
 And Heaven knows
 She'll go sailin' off on any old wind that blows.
 Hmmm, hmm hmm, Hmmm, hmm, hmm 
 
 Hoof prints and foot prints deep ruts the wagons made 
 The victor and the loser came by here 
 No head stones but these bones bring Mascalero death moans 
 See the smooth black nuggets by the thousands laying here 
 Petrified but justified are these Apache tears 
 Dead grass dry roots hunger crying in the night 
 Ghost of broken hearts and laws are here 
 And who saw the young squaw they judged by their whiskey law 
 Tortured till she died of pain and fear 
 Where the soldiers lay her back are the black Apache tears 
 The young men the old men the guilty and the innocent 
 Bled red blood and chilled alike with fears 
 The red men the white men no fight ever took this land 
 So don't raise the dust when you pass here 
 They're sleeping and in my keeping are these Apache tears
 
 When I'm alone I often think of an old house on the hill
 Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will
 And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din
 Mother would look around and ask are all the children in
 Well it's been many a year now and the old house on the hill
 No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still
 But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been
 I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in
 And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day
 When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play
 When we step across the river where mother so long has been
 Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in 
 
 Some men were born in poverty some were born with wealth
 I was born a lovin' man and I just can't help myself
 The women have all made over this old boy ever since I was born
 That's why these old Arkansas travelin' shoes are so well worn
 
 I've made quite a name for myself the girls know who I am
 I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man yes I am
 Now in every little town that I've been in the story is the same
 The girls all keep on a hangin' around playin' them lovin' games
 
 But sometimes I wish them women folks would leave this old boy alone
 I've thought about catchin' that next Greyhound back to my Arkansas home
 But there ain't no use in kiddin' myself I like the way I am
 I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man
 
 Oh yes I am
 Now you look here woman that look in your eyes says maybe you love me so
 But if you turn loose of my coatail I'll get my bedroll and go
 'Cause I ain't nowhere near the kind of a fella that'll settle down
 I've got a natural talent for lovin' and I'm gonna spred it around
 
 If I ever come back your way again remember who I am
 I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man
 I'm a natural actual real authentical Arkansas lovin' man yes I am
 
 As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow 
 As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow 
 The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation 
 Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation 
 After the US revolution corn planter was a chief 
 He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief 
 He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed 
 That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined 
 George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand 
 They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land 
 As long as the moon shall rise... 
 On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now 
 Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how 
 Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam 
 It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam 
 It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin 
 It will drown the Indians graveyards corn planter can you swim 
 The earth is mother to the the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground 
 Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down 
 As long as the moon shall rise... 
 The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south 
 But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth 
 The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site 
 But the great good army engineers said that he had no right 
 Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way 
 They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay 
 Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea 
 So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy 
 As long as the moon shall rise... 
 Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring 
 The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling 
 It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time 
 Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine 
 No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill 
 In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill 
 But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow 
 The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow 
 As long as the moon shall rise  as long as the rivers flow  
 As long as the sun will shine  as long as the grass shall grow
 
 They had a warrant out for me all over the country
 And I was trying to beat the raps in Idaho
 I was breaking into a schoolhouse Sunday morning without warning
 When I saw the sheriff coming for me slow from down below
 
 His steel gray eyes were blazing when he saw me
 His hand was on his gun when he rode up
 He said you killed that woman I know you shot her why'd you do it
 I'm taking you to Austin then I'm gonna lock you up
 
 Well he tied me with a plow line the next morning
 And he had me deep in Texas the next day
 A crazy screaming lynch mob waited in the streets of Austin
 But he put me in the jailhouse and he threw the key away
 
 A jury found me guilty three months later twelve evil men with murder in their eyes
 They even took me out and said now show us where you killed her
 And that wicked judge said now I here by sentence you to die
 But here I am far away from Austin prison my friend the jailer handed me a file
 Now all I want between me and there are a lot of friendly people
 And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
 
 Away in a manger, no crib for His bed
 The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
 The stars in the Heavens looked down where He lay
 The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
 
 The cattle are lowing, the poor baby wakes
 But little Lord Jesus no crying He makes
 I love thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
 And stay by my credo till morning is nigh
 
 Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
 Close by me forever and love me I pray
 Bless all the dear children in my tender care
 And take us to Heaven to live with Thee there
 
 Please, take us to Heaven to live with Thee there

 I see the bad moon arisin'
 I see trouble on the way
 I see earthquakes and lightnin'
 I see bad times today
 
 Don't go around tonight
 Well, it's bound to take your life
 There's a bad moon on the rise
 
 I hear hurricanes ablowin'
 I know the end is comin' soon
 I fear rivers overflowin'
 I hear the voice of rage and ruin
 
 Don't go around tonight
 Well, it's bound to take your life
 There's a bad moon on the rise
 Alright
 
 Hope you got your things together
 Hope you are quite prepared to die
 Looks like we're in for nasty weather
 One eye is taken for an eye
 
 Well, don't go around tonight
 Well, it's bound to take your life
 There's a bad moon on the rise
 
 Don't go around tonight
 Well, it's bound to take your life
 There's a bad moon on the rise
 
 Ha ha ha come on bad news ha ha
 
 Well bad news travels like wildfire, good news travels slow
 They call me Ol' Wildfire, 'cuz everybody knows
 That I'm bad news, everywhere I go
 Always gettin' in trouble
 And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
 
 From north to south, east to west the story is the same
 From one state to another, I have to change my name
 'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go
 Always gettin' in trouble
 And leaving little girls that hate to see me go
 
 Now they tried to hang me down in Oakland and they did in Frisco
 But I wouldn't choke and I broke their rope and they had to let me go
 'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go 
 Always gettin' in trouble
 And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
 
 I've picked peaches in Georgia, lumberjacked up in Maine
 I've been hired and fired and put in jail in every state you can name
 'Cuz I'm bad news, everywhere I go
 Always gettin' in trouble
 And leaving little girls who hate to see me go
 
 There's a story in our town
 Of the prettiest girl around
 Golden hair and eyes of blue
 How those eyes could flash at you 
 Boys hung 'round her by the score
 But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
 
 She was tops in all they said
 It never once went to her head
 She had everything it seems
 Not a care, this teenage queen 
 Other boys could offer more
 But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store
 
 He would marry her next spring
 Saved his money, bought a ring
 Then one day a movie scout
 Came to town to take her out 
 Hollywood could offer more
 So she left the boy next door working at the candy store
 
 Very soon she was a star
 Pretty house and shiny car
 Swimming pool and a fence around
 But she missed her old home town 
 All the world was at her door
 All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store
 
 Then one day the teenage star
 Sold her house and all her cars
 Gave up all her wealth and fame
 Left it all and caught a train 
 Do I have to tell you more
 She came back to the boy next door who worked at the candy store
 
 One time I was down to Jamaica to a place called Rose Hall Plantation
 They grow a lot of sugarcane and tomatoes and things at Rose Hall now
 It used to be just a sugarcane plantation back in the days of slavery
 And they tell stories about the place and about the great house at Rose Hall
 That many many years ago they came from the country of Haiti
 A lady named Annie Palmer who lived in that great house there
 And she was a mistress of the plantation she was the boss her word was law
 Well they tell a lot of tales about Annie
 They say she had three husbands one at a time I guess
 But they also tell tales about Annie and the slaves
 There were about 5000 slaves on the plantation
 And she had her favorites and she had the ones that weren't her favorites
 Well down on the sea there're three tall palm trees wavin' in the breeze
 And they say that maybe Annie Palmer's three husbands
 Are buried under those palm trees
 
 On the Island of Jamaica quite a long long time ago
 At Rose Hall Plantation where the ocean breezes blow
 Lived a girl named Annie Palmer the mistress of the place
 And the slaves all lived in fear to see a frown on Annie's face
 
 Where's your husband Annie where's number two and three
 Are they sleeping neath the palms beside the Caribbean Sea
 At night I hear you ridin' and I hear your lovers call
 And still can feel your presence round the great house at Rose Hall hmm
 
 Well if you should ever go to see the great house at Rose Hall
 There's expensive chairs and china and great paintings on the wall
 They'll show you Annie's sitting room and the whipping post outside
 But they won't let you see the room where Annie's husbands died
 Where's your husband Annie
 
 In a southern town where I was born
 That's where I got my education
 I worked in the fields and I walked in the woods
 And I wondered at creation
 
 I recall the sun in a sky of blue
 And the smell of green things growin'
 And the seasons changed and I lived each day
 Just the way the wind was blowin'
 
 Then I heard of a cultured city life
 Breathtakin' lofty steeples
 And the day I called myself a man
 I left my land and my people
 
 And I rambled north and I rambled east
 And I tested and I tasted
 And a girl or two, took me round and round
 But they always left me wasted
 
 In a world that's all concrete and steel
 With nothin' green ever growin'
 Where the buildings hide the risin' sun
 And they blocked the free winds from blowin'
 
 Where you sleep all day and you wake all night
 To a world of drink and laughter
 I met that girl that I was sure would be
 The one that I was after
 
 In a soft blue gown and formal tux
 Beneath that lofty steeple
 He said, "Do you Barbara, take this man
 Will you be one of his people?"
 
 And she said, "I will", and she said, "I do"
 And the world looked mighty pretty
 And we lived in a fancy downtown flat
 'Cause she loved the noisy city
 
 But the days grew cold beneath a yellow sky
 And I longed for green things growin'
 And the thoughts of home and the people there
 But she'd not agreed to goin'
 
 Then her hazel eyes turned away from me
 With a look that wasn't pretty
 And she turned into concrete and steel
 And she said, "I'll take the city"
 
 Now the cars go by on the interstate
 And my pack is on my shoulder
 But I'm goin' home, where I belong
 Much wiser now and older
 
 Well I tell you a story about a good man 
 Who had many a problem before he reached dry land 
 It ain't easy for a good man to go down no it ain't easy for a good man to go down 
 On the earth there was trouble sorrow and pain 
 So the Lord said to Noah I'm gonna make it rain 
 It ain't easy for a good man to go down no it ain't easy for a good man to go down 
 Noah gathered his sons and the ark it was raised 
 Two by two came the animals that they might be saved 
 It ain't easy... 
  
 Well it rainded forty days and it rained forty nights 
 All the earth it was covered the mountains out of sight 
 It ain't easy for a good man to go down no it ain't easy for a good man to go down 
 When the waters receded and the earth it was dry 
 The Lord said to Noah go forth and multiply 
 It ain't easy for a good man to go down no it ain't easy for a good man to go down 
 Yes the Lord made a ranbow way up in the sky 
 He promised no flood would ever murder you and die 
 It ain't easy for a good man to go down no it ain't easy for a good man to go down
 
 Fighting soldiers from the sky,
 Fearless men, Who jump and die.
 Men who mean, Just what they say.
 The brave men, Of the green beret
 
 Silver wings upon their chest,
 These are men, America's best.
 One Hundred men Will test today,
 But only three, Win the green beret.
 
 Trained to live off natures land,
 Trained in combat, hand to hand.
 Men who fight by night and day,
 Courage take, From the Green beret.
 
 Silver wings Upon their chest,
 These are men, America's best.
 One hundred men will test today,
 But only three win the green beret
 
 Back at home a young wife waits,
 Her green beret has met his fate.
 he has died for those apress,
 Leaving her this last request
 
 Put silver wings On my son's chest,
 Make him one of america's best.
 He'll be a man He'll test one day.
 Have him win, the Green beret.
 
 Son said my mother when I was knee high 
 You need of clothes to cover you and not a rag have I 
 There's nothing in the house to make a boy's britches 
 Nor shears to cut a cloth with nor thread to take stitches 
 There's nothing in the house but a leaf end of rye 
 And the harp with a with the woman's head nobody will by and she began to cry 
 That was in the early fall and when came the late fall 
 Son she said the sight of you makes your mother's blood crawl 
 Little skinny shoulder blades stickin' through your clothes 
 And where you get a jacket from God above knows 
 It's lucky for me lad your daddy's in the ground 
 And can't see the way I let his son go around and she made a queer sound 
 That was in the late fall when the winter came 
 I'd not a pair of bridges nor a shirt to my name 
 I couldn't go to school or out of doors to play 
 And all the other little boys passed our way 
 Son said my mother come climb into my lap 
 And I'll chave your little knees while you take a nap 
 And oh but we were silly for half an hour or more 
 Me with my long legs draggin' on the floor 
 I rocked rocked rocked to a mother goose rhyme 
 Oh but we were happy for half an hour's time 
 But there was I a great boy and what would folks say 
 To hear my mother singin' me to sleep all day in such a daft way 
 Men say the winter was bad that year fuel was scarce and food was dear 
 A wind with a wolf's head howled about our door 
 And we burned up the chairs and sat upon the floor 
 All that was left us was a chair we couldn't break 
 And the harp with the woman's head nobody would take for song or pity sake 
 The night before Christmas I cried with the cold 
 I cried myself to sleep like a two year old 
 And in the deep night I felt my mother rise 
 And stare down upon me with love in her eyes 
 I saw my mother sitting on the one good chair 
 A light falling on her face from I couldn't tell where 
 Looking nineteen and not a day older 
 And the harp with the woman's head leaned against her shoulder 
 Her thin fingers moving in the thin tall strings 
 Were weave weave weaving wonderful things 
 Many bright threads from where I couldn't see 
 Were running through the harp strings rapidly 
 And gold threads whistlin' through my mother's hands 
 I saw the web grow and the pattern expand 
 She wove a child's jacket and when it was done 
 She laid it on the floor and wove another one 
 She wove a red cloak so regal to see 
 She's made it for a king's son I said and not for me but I knew it was for me 
 She wove a pair of bridges and quicker than that 
 She wove a pair of boots a little cocked hat 
 She wove a pair of mittens she wove a little blouse 
 She wove all night in the still cold house 
 She sang as she worked and the harp strings spoke 
 But her voice never faltered and the thread never broke 
 But when I awoke there sat my mother 
 With the harp against her shoulder lookin' nineteen and not a day older 
 A smile about her lips and a light about her head 
 And her hands in the harp strings frozen dead 
 And piled up beside her toppling to the skies 
 Were the clothes of a king's son just my size
 
 I couldn't hear you for the TV, I didn't know you said goodbye
 I saw your canceled check for the airfare, didn't know flyin' got too high
 Beans for breakfast once again, hard to eat 'em from the can.
 
 I've run out of clean utensils, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
 I heard the crows outside my window, guess it's me they're talkin' about
 The fire you lit has burnt to cinders, every good things fizzled out
 Beans for breakfast once again, hard to eat 'em from the can.
 
 Wish you'd come back and wash the dishes, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
 Caught a cold with the window open, crow droppings o my window sill
 Probably got histoplasmosis, got no gun or I would kill them crows
 Beans for breakfast once again, hard to eat 'em from the can.
 
 Plastic forks are a dime a dozen I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
 Finally made it to the mailbox, felt so bad I thought I'd die
 All I got was a bill from my doctor, well I guess flyin' ain't so high
 Bean for breakfast once again, hard to eat 'em from the can.
 
 Blue tick mattress cold and greasy, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man
 The house burned down from the fire that I built, in your closet by mistake
 After I took all them pills, but I got out safe in my duck head overalls
 Beans for breakfast once again, I'm a hungry nasty lonesome man.
 
 She was called a scarlet woman by the people
 Who would go to church but left me in the street
 With no parents of my own,I never had a home
 And an eighteen year old boy has got to eat
 
 She found me outside one Sunday morning
 Taking money from a man I didn't know
 She took me in and wiped away my childhood
 A woman of the streets this Lady Rose
 
 This bed of roses that I lay on
 Where I was taught to be a man
 This bed of roses where I'm living
 Is the only kind of love I understand
 
 She was a handsome woman just thirty-four
 Who was spoken to in town by very few
 She managed a late evening business
 Like most of the town wished they could do
 
 And I learned all the things that a man should know
 From a woman not approved of I suppose
 But she died knowing that I really loved her
 Off life's bramble bush,I picked a rose
 
 I know that hearts were loving
 Long before I was here
 And I'm not the first to ever cry
 In my bed or in my beer
 There were songs before there was radio
 Of love that stays and love that goes
 They were writing meloncholy tunes
 And tearful words that rhyme
 
 Before my time
 Before my time
 
 There were songs in old dusty books
 Of love thats always been
 Sweet lovers in their glory
 Who are now gone with the wind
 Old fashion love words spoken then
 Keep coming back around again
 Nothings changed except the names
 Their love burns just like mine
 
 Before my time
 Before my time
 
 And in the dim of yesterday
 I can clearly see
 That flesh and blood cried out to someone
 As it does in me
 And there was some old song that said
 I love you 'til I die
 
 Before my time
 Before my time
 
 But what the old time masters had
 Is what I feel for you
 Love is love and doesn't change
 In a century or two
 If someway they had seen and knew
 How it would be for me and you
 They'd wish for love like yours
 And they would wish for love like mine
 
 Before my time
 Before my time
 
 1776 the thirteen colonies
 Broke away from British rule and took a stand
 "We're on our own", they said
 And they looked across the land
 With a defiant challenge
 They looked across the land
 
 "We will conquer you", the colonists said
 ?We see your mighty mountains
 We know of your lush green valleys
 We're comin' to claim you, to tame you"
 And the 'Movement Westward' started
 
 Well, the Bible tells us about a man
 Who ruled Babylon and all its land
 Around the city he built the wall
 And declared that Babylon would never fall
 
 He had concubines and wives
 He called his Babylon "Paradise"
 On his throne, he drank and ate
 But for Belshazzar it was getting late
 
 For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
 His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand
 He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
 His houses were built upon the sand
 
 Well, the people feasted and drank their wine
 And praised the false gods of his time
 All holy things they scorned and mocked
 But suddenly all their mocking stopped
 
 For on the wall there appeared a hand
 Nothing else, there was no man
 In blood the hand began to write
 And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright
 
 For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
 His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand
 He was weighed in the balance and found wanting
 His houses were built upon the sand
 
 Well, no one around could understand
 What was written by the mystic hand
 Belshazzar tried but couldn't find
 A man who could give him piece of mind
 
 But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God
 He saw the writing on the wall in blood
 Belshazzar asked him what it said
 And Daniel turned to the wall and read
 
 "My friend you're weighed in the balance and found wanting
 Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand
 You're weighed in the balance and found wanting
 Your houses are built upon the sand"
 
 Hmm an old man on his deathbed once said to me
 You are the master of your destiny
 A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
 But a man's not all good nor all bad
 When the chips're all down and your back's at the wall
 You're the best friend that you've ever had
 You're the best friend that you've ever had
 
 So you laugh when it's time to laugh and you cry when it's time to cry
 Live while it's time to live cause you'll die when it's time to die hmm
 
 Then he closed his eyes and he left me alone
 This old man's wisdom brought his meaning home
 
 A diamond is a diamond
 
 Well now that I'm older I found this is true
 The thing that remains is the good that you do
 A diamond is a diamond and a stone is a stone
 But a man's not all good nor all bad
 When the chips are all down and your back's at the wall
 God is the best friend that you've ever had
 God is the best friend that you've ever had
 
 So you laugh when it's time
 
 But the land was already claimed by a people
 When the cowboy came and when the soldiers came
 The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways
 A story of tragedy, like that day at Wounded Knee, South Dakota
 
 Big Foot was an Indian chief
 Of the Minneconjou band
 A band of Minneconjou Sioux
 From South Dakota land
 
 Big Foot said to Custer
 "Stay away from Crazy Horse"
 But Custer crossed into Sioux land
 And he never came back across
 
 Then Big Foot led his people
 To a place called Wounded Knee
 And they found themselves surrounded
 By the 7th Cavalry
 
 Big chief Big Foot
 Rise up from your bed
 Minneconjou babies cry
 For their mothers lying dead
 
 Big Foot was down with a fever
 When he reached Wounded Knee
 And his people all were prisoners
 Of the 7th Cavalry
 
 Two hundred women and children
 And another hundred men
 Raised up a white flag of peace
 But peace did not begin
 
 An accidental gunshot
 And Big Foot was first to die
 And over the noise of the rifles
 You could hear the babies cry
 
 Big chief Big Foot
 It's good that you can't see
 Revenge is being wrought
 By Custer's 7th Cavalry
 
 Then smoke hung over the canyon
 On that cold December day
 All was death and dying
 Around where Big Foot lay
 
 Farther on up the canyon
 Some had tried to run and hide
 But death showed no favorites
 Women, men, and children died
 
 One side called it a massacre
 The other a victory
 But the white flag is still waving
 Today at Wounded Knee
 
 Big chief Big Foot
 Your Minneconjou band
 Is more than remembered here
 In South Dakota land
 
 To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
 Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
 No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
 The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
 Big iron on his hip
 
 It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
 He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
 "He's an outlaw loose and runnin'",  came a whisper from each lip
 "And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
 Big iron on his hip"
 
 In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
 Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
 He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
 And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
 One and nineteen more
 
 Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
 Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
 He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
 And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
 After Texas Red
 
 Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
 But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
 Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
 Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
 Big iron on his hip
 
 Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
 It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
 Folks were watchin' from their windows,
 Every body held their breath,
 They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
 About to meet his death
 
 There was twenty feet between them
 When they stopped to make their play
 And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
 Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
 And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
 Big iron on his hip
 
 It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
 There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
 Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
 When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
 Big iron on his hip
 
 Big iron, big iron,
 Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
 Big iron on his hip
 
 Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,
 And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
 And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
 Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.
 
 I met her accidentally in St. Paul .
 And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.
 Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,
 And I followed you, Big River, when you called.
 
 Then you took me to St. Louis later on .
 A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
 I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.
 She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.
 
 Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.
 Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
 Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf.
 She loves you, Big River, more than me.
 
 Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry
 And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
 And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.
 Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.
 
 Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues 
 C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
 Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones
 Put taps on your toes and get goin'
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues.
 
 Little shoeshine boy never get slowed down
 But he's got the dirtiest job in town
 Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
 On the windy corner of a dirty street
 Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
 How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
 He grinned as he raised his little head
 Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.
 
 Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues 
 C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
 A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine 
 It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind,
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues.
 
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues 
 C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
 Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones
 Put taps on your toes and get goin'
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues.
 
 Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
 And I thought I was gonna jump with joy
 Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
 He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
 He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
 I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way
 He said I like it with a big wide grin
 Kept on a poppin' and he said again
 
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues
 C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
 It only cost a dime, just a nickel a shoe
 It does a million dollars worth of good for you
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues
 
 Ordained for proclaimin' the gospel of Jesus
 The great super preachers go crusadin' on
 And the people all gather in big congregations
 They hear of the Saviour who came to atone
 And they kneel at the altar and they walk away happy
 Then the devil starts gossip about money and sex
 Makin' it hard on the good men of God like Billy and Bob and Oral and Rex
 Old Billy Sunday is dead and gone young Jim Robertson's comin' on strong
 And Billy and Rex and Oral and Bob are talkin' about Jesus and doin' their job
 
 Millions of people tune in Katherine Coolman
 And see her face shine with an unearthly light
 Garner Ted warns of the world of tomorrow
 But they criticized him and the reverend died
 'Cause the devil is after the great super preachers
 He'd try to discredit the gospel they bring
 But Billy and Rex and Oral and Bob hold to their commitment to Jesus the King
 Old Billy Sunday is dead and gone young Tommy Barnett is comin' on strong
 And Billy and Rex and Oral and Rex are talkin' about Jesus and doin' their job
 Old Billy Sunday is dead and gone young Jimmy Snow is comin' on strong
 And Billy and Rex and Oral and Bob are talkin' about Jesus and doin' their job
 
 Like a bird on a wire
 Like a drunk in a midnight choir
 I have tried in my way to be free
 Like a fish on a hook
 Like a knight in some old fashioned book
 I have saved all my ribbons for thee
 
 And if I, if I have been unkind
 I just hope you will let it go by
 And if I, if I have been untrue
 I hope you know it was never to you
 
 Like a baby stillborn
 Like a beast with his horn
 I have torn everyone who reached out to me
 
 But I swear by this song
 And by all I have done wrong
 I'll make it all up to be
 
 I saw a young man leaning on his wooden crutch
 He called out to me, "Don't ask for so much"
 And a young woman leaning in her darkened door
 She cried out to me, "Why not ask for more"
 
 Like a bird on a wire
 Like a drunk in a midnight choir
 I have tried in my way to be free
 
 I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot
 Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead
 What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city
 Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed
 
 he's got a whole lotta motion in her sole, I know
 But her sole ain't the place she lets it show
 
 She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
 Lord I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
 She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart
 What a mighty crazy cooking way to go
 
 I've got great big blisters on my fingertips
 From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills
 And I got tiny white blisters in my throat
 From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills
 
 And ever since she started running around from bar to bar
 I just can't eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down
 
 She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
 She done got me, oh yeah
 She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart
 What a mighty crazy cooking way to go
 
 She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah
 Oh I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
 Blistered, blistered

 My baby's gone and I'm alone to live in misery,
 I'm gonna call and make a reservation for me.
 
 Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train.
 Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train.
 
 I'm gonna climb aboard and ride until I learn to smile,
 I'll be knockin' out the blues while I'm knockin' out the miles.
 With my guitar, beat and rhythm, to the click-clack of the wheels
 I'm gonna sing the blues 'cause that's the way that I feel.
 
 Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train.
 Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train.
 
 Conductor, go and tell the man to shovel on the coal
 It doesn't seem half as bad as long as I can roll.
 Give me another ticket and I'll stay and ride with you.
 There's nothing left to live for in this world we're rollin' through.
 
 Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train.
 Gonna ride a blue train, gonna ride a blue train.

 Hello friend, come on in, the gate is open wide
 Bound to be a fightin' free bonanza
 Singing pines of boundary lines for the Ponderosa Ranch
 
 Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
 Every dream has only brought me pain
 All my life, I've always been so blue
 Born to lose, and now I'm losing you
 
 Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
 How I long to always have you near
 You've grown tired, and now you say we're through
 Born to lose, and now I'm losing you
 
 Born to lose, my every hope is gone
 It's so hard to face an empty dawn
 You were all the happiness I knew
 Born to lose, and now I'm losing you
 
 There's no use to dream of happiness
 All I see is only loneliness
 All my life, I've always been so blue
 Born to lose, and now I'm losing you

 Breaking bread, breaking bread
 We are gathered here together to break bread
 Breaking bread, breaking bread
 We are gathered here together to break bread
 
 It's not the barley or the wheat
 It's not the oven or the heat
 That makes this bread so good to eat
 It's the needing and the sharing that makes the meal complete
 
 Breaking bread, breaking bread
 We are gathered here together to break bread
 Breaking bread, breaking bread
 We are gathered here together to break bread
 
 Upon the water prayed his cast
 The last is first, the first is last
 For everyone who eats this bread
 There are thousands maybe more that will be fed
 
 Breaking bread, breaking bread
 We are gathered here together to break bread
 Breaking bread, breaking bread
 We are gathered here together to break bread
 
 Breaking bread, breaking bread
 We are gathered here together to break bread
 
 When you're weary, feeling small
 When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all
 I'm on your side when times get rough
 And friends just can't be found
 Like a bridge over troubled water
 I will lay me down
 Like a bridge over troubled water
 I will lay me down
 
 When you're down and out
 When you're on the street
 When evening falls so hard
 I will comfort you
 I'll take your part
 When darkness comes
 And pain is all around
 Like a bridge over troubled water
 I will lay me down
 Like a bridge over troubled water
 I will lay me down
 
 Sail on silver girl
 Sail on by
 Your time has come to shine
 All your dreams are on their way
 See how they shine
 Oh, if you need a friend
 I'm sailing right behind
 Like a bridge over troubled water
 I will ease your mind
 Like a bridge over troubled water
 I will ease your mind
 
 Got a song about the sister waitin' somewhere by the phone
 For some man who never missed her ever since he come and gone
 Ain't it's harder for a woman with a baby on her way
 That's the price of being human when you're poor enough to pay
 
 And she listen to the freedom in the silence at her door
 No one missin' when you need 'em there ain't no fun to sing that song no more
 
 Got a song about a saviour looking lonesome and afraid
 At a city full of strangers and a cross he never made
 And he's sadder than he's wiser and a longer way from home
 And he wonders why his father left him bleeding and alone
 
 Just a broken song of freedom and the closing of a door
 No one's missin' 'til you need 'em there ain't no fun to sing that song no more
 
 Just a broken song
 
 Oh, arrested on charges over unemployment
 He was sitting in the witness stand.
 The judges wife called a district attorney
 She said free that browned eye man
 If you want your job you better free that brown eyed handsome man.
 
 Well, flying across the desert in a TWA,
 I saw a woman walkin' in the sand.
 She'd be walking thirty miles en route to bombay
 To meet a brown eyed handsome man,
 Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man.
 
 Way back in history three thousand years,
 In fact ever since the world began,
 There's been a whole lotta good women shedding tears
 Over a brown eyed handsome man,
 A lot of trouble was a brown eyed handsome man.
 
 Well, a beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
 Between a doctor and a lawyer man.
 Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
 A brown eyed handsome man,
 Just like your daddy was, a brown eyed handsome man.
 
 Well, the milo de venus was a beautiful lass,
 She had the world in the palm of her hand
 She lost both her arms in a wrestling match
 To win a brown eyed handsome man,
 She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man.
 
 Well, a two, three the count with nobody home
 He hit a hi'flyer into the stand.
 A rounded third he was a-headin' for home
 It was a brown eyed handsome man that won the game.
 It was a brown eyed handsome man.
 
 Well first you gotta want to get off,
 Bad enough to want to get on in the first place
 And you better trust in your lady luck
 Pray to God that she don't give up on you right now
 
 Live fast, die young, bull rider
 
 One hand hold is all you got
 To pit you and the bull against the clock and a course crowd
 And once apon a spinning ton
 Nothing else you've ever done can pull this way
 You're just outside the bucking chute
 You lose a spur and you lose your seat and you lose yourself
 By now he's bucking mean and dirty
 Slinging mud and cowboy boots and kicking clowns
 
 No fools, no fun, bull rider
 
 You gotta feel the way he's moving, you gotta watch his head
 And brace yourself for anything that render you might dead
 You know the art of hanging loose is hanging just as tight
 Well it's something like a hurricane that's dancing with a kite
 
 Well the rodeo is more than rough
 It's a fact of life and it's tough to cut and it's beaver hats
 It's drinking beer and pulling trailers
 Tight lemae on barrel racers and a horse bucking
 
 No rides, no pay, bull rider
 
 Live fast, die young, bull rider
 
 Lord, I've never lived where churches grow 
 I loved creation better as it stood 
 That day you finished it so long ago 
 And looked upon your work and called it good 
 I know that others find you in the light 
 That sifted down through tinted window panes 
 And yet I seem to feel you near tonight 
 In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains 
 
 I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well 
 That you've made my freedom so complete 
 That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell 
 Nor weak eyed prisoner of Waller Street 
 Just let me live my life as I've begun 
 And give me work that's open to the sky 
 Make me a partner of the wind and sun 
 And I won't ask a life that's soft or high 
 
 Let me be easy on the man that's down 
 Let me be square and generous with all 
 I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town 
 But never let them say I'm mean or small 
 Make me as big and open as the plains 
 And honest as the horse between my knees 
 Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains 
 Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze 
 
 Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget 
 You know about the reasons that are hid 
 You understand the things that gall or fret 
 Well, you knew me better than my mother did 
 Just keep an eye on all that's done or said 
 And right me sometimes when I turn aside 
 And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead 
 That stretches upward toward the great divide
 
 Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie 
 These words came low and mournfully 
 From the pallid lips of a youth who lay 
 On his dying bed at the close of day
 
 Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there 
 But we took no heed to his dying prayer 
 In a shallow grave just six by three 
 We buried him there on the lone prairie
 
 My bills are all due and the babies need shoes but I'm busted
 Cotton is down to a quarter a pound and I'm busted
 I've got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay
 A big stack of bills that get bigger each day
 The County will haul my belongings away I'm busted!
 
 I went to my brother to ask for a loan I was busted
 I hate to beg like a dog for a bone but I'm busted
 My brother said there ain't a thing I can do
 My wife and my kids are all down with the flu
 And I was just thinking of calling on you I'm busted!
 
 Well I'm finally goin' back to Louisiana 
 Runnin' and thumbin' all the way
 That started out the way out in California
 I been makin' bout five hundred miles a day
 I covered all the beaches on the west coast 
 From Mexico to Crason City Bay
 But Calilou was not in California 
 That's where her daddy came from by the way
 And by the way her mother was a cajun
 She came from New Orleans I've heard her say
 And it's just like a girl to wanna see her mama
 So I might find her there along the way
 
 Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless
 Well they should have call you drifter
 Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou
 
 I recall the first time that I saw her 
 I picked her up near Phoenix in my car
 Just another beauty seekin' fame and fortune
 And I told her if she should be a movie star
 The next time I saw her was Tucumcari 
 She served my bowl of chilly with a smile
 I said it's been a year since I last saw you
 Wonder how'd you like to share a few good miles
 Well the justice of the peace was very sleepy 
 I held her in my arms a whole night long
 I whispered words like settle down and family
 And when I woke up my Calilou was gone
 
 Calilou Calilou well they should have call you restless
 Well they should have call you drifter
 Yeah they should have call you trouble instead of Calilou
 
 A little girl woke up deep in the dark and started cryin'
 The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight
 She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine
 Cry, "Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine"
 
 Her mother wiped the tears and said, "See honey, you're only dreaming
 Your dad must work today, he has to draw his pay"
 She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time
 "Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine"
 
 Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble
 And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground
 The little girl was fast asleep, yet cried out one more time
 "Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine"
 
 Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground
 A dying man was found had survived all those around
 He'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time
 When he heard his own child whine, "Call daddy from the mine
 Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine"
 
 Bayou bayou bayou bayou
 Now here's a little tale about a flock of geese
 Lookin' for a home and lookin' for a peace
 But before they're safely in the southern sand
 They gotta watch out for the critter called man
 There's a goose and a gander and a goslin' child
 Headin' on south at the call of the wild
 Honk and holler as we go gonna see the Gulf of Mexico
 Way up high don't fly low the long toms will get you from the old bayou
 
 Well the wind from the north it chills you to the bone
 And the call of the wild is callin' me come home
 I'll lead my band of geese a marry trip we'll navigate that mighty Mississipp'
 Honk and holler as we go
 Bayou bayou bayou bayou
 
 Honk and holler as we go
 
 When you get a chance
 Would you please call your mother
 And thank her for the good years that we had?
 Gently break the news that you don't love me
 And give my best regards to your good old dad
 
 I always liked your family
 We got along just splendidly
 Though your brother
 Kind of rubbed me the wrong way
 I remember that your eyes turned green
 When they crowned your sister County Queen
 Though she couldn't hold a candle
 To your beauty any day
 
 When you get a chance
 Would you please call your mother
 And thank her for the good years that we had?
 Gently break the news that you don't love me
 And give my best regards to your good old dad
 
 Back when we could laugh and play
 On family reunion day
 Didn't we all look funny
 In our 1950s clothes?
 Your daddy wore that greasy stuff
 Your brother drank more than enough
 Your mom wore penny loafers
 With runners in her hose
 
 When you get a chance
 Would you please call your mother
 And thank her for the good years that we had?
 O gently break the news that you don't love me
 And give my best regards to your good old dad
 
 When you get a chance
 Would you please call your mother
 And give my best regards to your good old dad
 
 I don't know where I'm bound
 I don't know where I'm bound
 Whistles calling me away
 Leaving at the break of day and
 I don't know where I'm bound
 
 Can't stand locks, bars or doors
 Mean cops insanity and wars
 Gotta find a place of peace
 Till then much travellin' on seas
 But I don't know where I'm bound
 
 There's gotta be a place for me
 Under some green growing tree
 Clear cool water running by
 An unfettered view of the sky
 But I don't know where I'm bound
 
 When I die don't bury me
 Cause then I must be free
 Cremate my body with a grin
 Throw my ashes to the wind
 Cause I don't know where I'm bound
 
 I don't know where I'm bound
 I don't know where I'm bound
 Whistles calling me away
 Leaving at the break of day and
 I don't know where I'm bound
 
 Got myself a little gall
 She has been a damn right pall
 That ol' highway's calling me
 And free I gotta be but
 I don't know where I'm bound
 
 Love, oh, love, oh careless love
 Love, oh, love, oh careless love
 Love, oh, love, oh careless love
 You see what love has done to me
 
 I'd love my mama and papa too
 I'd love my mama and papa too
 I'd love my mama and papa too
 I'd leave them both to go with you
 
 What, oh what, will mama say
 What, oh what, will mama say
 What, oh what, will mama say
 When she learns I've gone astray
 
 Once I wore my apron low
 Once I wore my apron low
 Once I wore my apron low
 I couldn't scarcely keep you from my door
 
 Now my apron strings don't pin
 Now my apron strings don't pin
 Now my apron strings don't pin
 You pass my door and you don't come in
 
 Come all you rounders if you want to hear the story about a brave engineer
 Casey Jones was the roller's name on a 68 wheeler course he won his fame
 Caller called Casey bout half past four he kissed his wife at the station door
 He climbed in the cabin with his orders in his hand
 Said this is the trip to the Promised Land
 Casey Jones climbed in the cabin Casey Jones orders in his hand
 Casey Jones leanin' out the window taking a trip to the Promised Land
 
 Through South Memphis Yards on a fly rain been a fallin' and the water was high
 Everybody knew by the engine's moan that the man at the throttle was Casey Jones
 Well Jones said fireman now don't you fret Sam Webb said we ain't a givin' up yet
 We're eight hours late with the southbound mail
 We'll be on time or we're leavin' the rails
 Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
 
 Dead on the rail was a passenger train blood was a boilin' in Casey's brain
 Casey said hey now look out ahead jump Sam jump or we'll all be dead
 With a hand on a whistle and a hand on a brake north Mississippi was wide awake
 I see railroad official said he's a good engineer to be a laying dead
 Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
 
 Headaches and heartaches and all kinds of pain all the part of a railroad train
 Sweat and toil the good and the grand part of the life of a railroad man
 Casey Jones climbed in the cabin
 
 Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
 The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
 Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
 Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
 The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
 'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
 But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
 Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains
 
 "Oh!" she said, "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you!"
 "Here" she said, "just a kiss to make a body smile!"
 "See" she said, "I've put on new stockings just to please you!"
 "Lord!" she said, "Casey can you only stay a while?"
 
 Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the Golden Crown
 For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone
 Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
 Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
 Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
 Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
 Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
 Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye
 
 "Oh!" she said, "I suppose you seldom think about me
 "Now" she said, "now that you've a fam'ly of your own"
 "Still" she said, "it's so blessed good to feel your body!"
 "Lord!" she said" "Casey it's a shame to be alone!"
 
 A child arrived just the other day
 He came to the world in the usual way
 But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
 He learned to walk while I was away
 
 And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it and as he grew
 He said, I'm gonna be like you, Dad
 You know I'm gonna be like you
 
 And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon
 When you comin' home Dad?
 I don't know when but we'll get together then
 You know we'll have a good time then
 
 My son turned ten just the other day,
 He said "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play
 Can you teach me to throw?", I said
 "Not today, I got a lot to do", he said, "That's okay"
 
 And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
 He said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah
 You know I'm gonna be like him"
 
 And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon
 When you comin' home, Dad?
 I don't know when but we'll get together then
 You know we'll have a good time then
 
 He came from college just the other day
 So much like a man, I just had to say
 "Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"
 He shook his head, and said with a smile
 
 "What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
 See ya later, can I have them please?"
 
 And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon
 When you comin' home Son?
 I don't know when but we'll get together then, Dad
 You know we'll have a good time then
 
 Now I've retired, my son's moved away
 I called him up just the other day
 I said, "I'd like to see you, if you don't mind"
 He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time
 My new job's a hassle and the kids got the flu
 But it's nice talkin' to you Dad, it's sure nice talkin' to you"
 
 As I hung up the phone it occurred to me
 He'd grown up just like me
 My boy was just like me
 
 And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon
 Little boy blue and the man on the moon
 When you comin' home, Son?
 I don't know when but we'll get together then Dad
 You gonna have a good time then
 
 I was just a kid roamin' around travelin' through a little ol' town 
 A man walked up and said come with me you're broke and son that's vagrancy 
 I carefree lad that love to roam but Lord I wish I'd stayed at home 
 The way it looks I'll probably hang cause there ain't no hope on a chain gang 
 I dig that ditch I chop that corn I curse the day that I was born 
 I believe it's better for a man to hang than to work like a dog on a chain gang 
 
 The guard stands there with a great big gun I bet he'd love to see me run 
 And I guess I probably will some day I'd rather be dead than to live this way 
 He's well fed and he's six foot tall and he's a meanest of them all 
 He cracks that whip and he swings that cane the sun must've touched his brain 
 I dig that ditch... 
 
 I got a gal back home that's sweet and kind and she's been waitin' a long long time 
 I just told her to forget my name I won't ever live down to shame 
 Lord deliver me from this hole before I lose my mind and soul 
 The place gets weak and the back gets broke ain't no cause to laugh and joke 
 I dig that ditch... 
 Work like a dog on a chain gang work like a dog on a chain gang

 One day near Christmas when I was just a child 
 Mama called us together and mama tried to smile 
 She said you know the cotton crop hasn't been too good this year 
 There's just no spending money and well at least we're all here 
 I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents 
 Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat 
 That's quite a blessing that'll make things a little more pleasant 
 And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were 
 At least we were all healthy and best of all we had her 
 Roy cut down a pigapple tree and we drug it home Jack and me 
 Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread 
 Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed 
 Mama and daddy sacrificed cause this Christmas was lean 
 But after all there was the babies Tom and Joanne babies need a few things 
 I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack and though we fought now and then 
 When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him 
 Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks 
 And when she ironed them down you couldn't tell that they hadn't come from town 
 A sharecropped family across the road didn't have it as good as us 
 They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk 
 And mama said well I bet they don't even have coaloil or beans to boil 
 A log apples cranges and such 
 Me and Jack took a jar of coaloil nd some hickernuts we'd found 
 We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down 
 A poor old ragged lady eased open the door 
 She picked up the coaloil and hickernuts and said 
 I sure do thank ye and quickly closed the door 
 We started back home me and Jack and about halfway we stopped looked back 
 And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light 
 So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night 
 Christmas came and Christmas went Christmas that year was heaven sent 
 Then daddy put on his gumboots waited for the thaw back home in Dyess Arkansas
 
 I'm just an old chunk of coal
 But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
 
 I'm gonna grow and glow 'til I'm so blue, pure perfect
 I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
 
 But I'm gonna kneel and pray everyday
 Lest I should become vain along the way
 
 I'm just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
 But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
 
 I'm gonna learn the right way to talk
 I'm gonna search and find a better way to walk
 
 I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
 Until I get rid of every single flaw
 
 I'm gonna be the world's best friend
 I'm gonna go around shakin' everybody's hand
 
 I'm gonna be the cotton-pickin' rage of the age
 Yes, I'm gonna be a diamond some day
 
 I said, "I'm just an old chunk of coal, my Lord
 But I'm gonna be a diamond some day"

 "The Bad Seeds performed Cindy regularly in their live sets in 1990,and indeed on a TV appearance as well. I have a version of Elvis Presly doing this song, but I think it's a traditional, also known as 'I Wish I Was An Apple', or as 'Sydney'. I think The Bad Seeds often sang 'Come on home, Sydney Cindy' -Maurice
 
 Wish I was an apple dangling from a tree
 Every time you'd pass me by you'd take a bite of me
 I wish I was a bluebird I'd never fly away
 I'd sit up on your shoulder baby and sing to you all day
 
 Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
 Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me
 
 I wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree
 Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee
 Told them that I love you, they all know its true
 Say it till the cows come home until it gets to you
 
 Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
 Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me
 
 Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot
 Need you in the afternoon to fan me when I'm hot
 Need you in the evening when supper time is through
 What I'm really tryin' to say is I can't get enough of you
 
 Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
 Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me
 
 If I were a musician I'd harp on just one thing
 You should never play my harp the way you pluck a string
 If only you would love me say it and tell me so
 I need two charms about me baby to have the whole world
 Know
 
 Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
 Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me
 
 Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home Cindy Cindy
 Come on home Cindy Cindy, Come on home to me
 
 Cisco Clifton had a fillin' station
 About a mile and a half from town
 Most cars passed unless they were out of gas
 So Cisco was always around
 
 Regular gas was all that it sold
 Except tobacco matches and oil
 Other than that he fixed lots of flats
 Keepin' Cisco rough hands soiled
 
 He'd wipe the gas and check the air
 In a hundred times a day
 He patiently gave directions
 On how to get to the state highway
 
 Usually he'd give 'em water
 Or a tyre or two some air
 And once a big black Cadillac
 Spent seven dollars there
 
 He'd give anybody anything they'd ask
 And lend anything he had
 His tools are tyres bumper jacks or wire
 To the good ones or the bad
 
 In wintertime there was a depot stove
 And a table for a checker game
 And every mornin' at sunup
 The same checker players came
 
 So Cisco Clifton's fillin' station
 Was always in the red
 Personal loans were personally gone
 But never a word was said
 
 One mornin' at eight, them checker players
 Heard a big bulldozer roar like a freight
 And Cisco said I hope my kids stay fed
 When they build that Interstate
 
 He'd managed to pay for property
 Where his little fillin' station sat
 And friends still came for checker game
 So Cisco settled for that
 
 He wouldn't say so but Cisco knew
 That the Interstate was too much to fight
 But to keep his will and to pay his bills
 He did odd jobs at night
 
 He still opened up at sunrise
 And the checker game went on
 The cars flew past on highest gas
 And the neighbors had sold out and gone
 
 If a car ever did go by he was lost
 And if they stopped they were treated the same
 So at Cisco Clifton's fillin' station
 There's a howdy and a checker game
 
 City jail city jail like an old scared dog I tuck my tail
 Bow my head and not a careless word is said
 Gotta sleep on the floor once more at city jail
 
 Well I was hangin' round the bus station
 Mindin' my own business like I always do
 When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe
 And I thought I check out the action like I always do
 I'd give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments
 About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team
 When she called the badge on me
 The badge grabbed me by the arm and he said
 What are you doin' hangin' around here for
 And I said for whatever's goin' around
 City jail city jail...
 
 He said no what I mean is what are you doin'
 Sayin' things like that to that lady
 And I said what's that lady's doin' with purple hair
 Well the badge said you're smart alec and I said no I ain't I'm just hungry
 And he said you're actin' like a smart alec
 And I said no that's how I act when I get hungry
 City jail city jail...
 
 Well he put me outside in a dark corner
 And before you could say hypocrite he hit me on the head
 And I said oh don't hit me on the head
 I can't protect myself with the handcuffs on
 Please don't hit me on the head then he hit me again he hit me again he hit me again
 And I said oh oh oh oh oh please don't stand on my feet when you hit me
 I break my ankles when I fall
 
 City jail city jail...
 
 Well about that time they threw me in the wagon
 And that waitress walked out with a sailor
 I said hey you not you I'm talkin' to the purple people eater
 Yes you lady quote you're the cause of it all unquote
 Then she said to that sailor said get me away from that horrible man Harry
 
 City jail city jail...
 Well as they hauled me away I said everybody have a nice evening
 
 Ridin' on the City of New Orleans
 Illinois Central, Monday mornin' rail
 15 cars and 15 restless riders
 Three conductors, 25 sacks of mail
 
 All along the southbound odyssey the train pulls out of Kankakee
 Rolls along past houses, farms & fields
 Passin' graves that have no name, freight yards full of old black men
 And the graveyards of rusted automobiles
 
 Good mornin' America, how are you?
 Don't you know me? I'm your native son!
 I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
 I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done
 
 Dealin' cards with the old men in the club car
 Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
 Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
 And feel the wheels grumblin' neath the floor
 
 And the sons of Pullman porters & the sons of engineers
 Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
 Mothers with their babes asleep, rockin' to the gentle beat
 And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
 
 Night time on the City of New Orleans
 Changin' cars in Memphis, Tennessee
 Halfway home, we'll be there by mornin'
 Through the Mississippi darkness rollin' down to the sea
 
 But all the towns & people seem to fade into a bad dream
 And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
 The conductor sings his song again
 "The passengers will please refrain,
 This train has got the disappearin' railroad blues
 
  
 She knew that Cody was the man she wanted but she had waited nearly all her life 
 Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye 
 Then he'd be back to take her for his wife  Clementine 
 Cody saddled up and left his darling then rode to town to celebrate his plan 
 He told 'em this would be his last carousing 
 
 I'm gonna settle down boys if I can  Clementine 
 Someone said it must have been past midnight when Cody had to face a jealous man 
 Another story goes that no one really knows 
 But it seems there was a dancehall girl called Nan  Clementine 
 We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room 
 Then there was a silence in the place 
 
 Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down 
 They found Cody lying on his face  Clementine 
 So buddies make a monument to lay down at his head 
 Sure you hate to leave your pal behind 
 
 Mother help your daughter put her wedding dress away 
 Cause Cody won't be riding back this time  Clementine
 
 Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
 I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
 I went right home and I went to bed
 I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.
 
 Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
 Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
 Made a good run but I run too slow
 They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.
 
 Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
 In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
 He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
 You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.
 
 I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
 If you've got a warrant just read it to me
 Shot her down cause she made me slow
 I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.
 
 When I was arrested I was dressed in black
 They put me on a train and they took me back
 Had no friends for to go my bail
 They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.
 
 Early next morning about a half past nine
 I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
 Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
 He said come on you dirty hack into that district court
 
 Into the court room my trial began
 Where I was handled by twelve honest men
 Just before the jury started out
 I saw that little judge commence to look about.
 
 In about five minutes in walked a man
 Holding the verdict in his right hand
 The verdict read in the first degree
 I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me
 
 The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
 Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
 Ninety nine years underneath that ground
 I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
 Come on you gotta listen unto me
 Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be
 
 Morning found me lyin' on a floor in New Orleans,
 Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans.
 
 Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues
 And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina.
 
 Met her on an oceanliner, called her Cocaine Carolina
 She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two.
 
 God knows how much I adored her I just never could afford her
 Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?
 
 So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
 I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do.
 
 She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey.
 Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?
 
 Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky.
 Lexington was famous for its bluegrass and its hills.
 Carolina we should get up, don't you know we'll have to split up,
 Maybe I should go to California
 
 So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through
 I'm going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do.
 
 She don't love me for my money, she just wants my body honey.
 Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you?
 
 Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina...
 Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina..
 
 One of these cold lonesome mornings, you're gonna kill me
 I'm gonna lay there and I'm gonna die
 You will soon give me pain enough to fill me
 'Cause I'm gone past doin' any good to cry
 
 And the warm sunshine is like a stranger
 There's a cruel violation with the dawn
 Lord, my pain can't stand illumination
 And one of these cold lonesome mornings I'll be gone
 
 One of these cold lonesome mornings, dark and early
 Before a wild bird sings I'm gonna fly
 While it's still dark and I'm still reachin' for you
 I'll wake up and I can't cry
 
 But I know my heart can't stand another tremor
 Now it's holding together I don't know
 But just before the dawning's first glimmer
 One of these cold lonesome mornings I'm gonna go
 
 Yes, one of these cold lonesome mornings you're gonna kill me 
 
 I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
 Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
 Now a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
 Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart
 
 Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
 And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
 In anger unkind words are said they make the teardrops start
 Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart
 
 Yeah, there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
 But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
 
 The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
 Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart
 Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart
 
 Come along and ride this train
 Come along and ride this rain
 Cross the mountains, prairies, reservations, rivers, levees, plains
 Come along and ride this train
 
 She said come in stranger 
 It's good to have you home 
 I hurried through 'cause I knew it was you 
 When I saw your dog, waggin' his tail 
 Honey, why didn't you let me know by mail 
 You've been gone so long 
 She said come in stranger 
 
 I know you're weary from all the miles 
 Just sit right there in your easy chair 
 And tell me all about the places you've been 
 How long it'll be before you leave again 
 I hope it's a long, long while 
 She said come in stranger 
 
 Everything 'round home is fine 
 I've watched and I've waited for you to get back 
 And I missed you all the time 
 
 She said come in, stranger 
 Oh how I miss you when you're gone 
 I walk the floor and I watch the door 
 And when I lie awake and wonder where you can be 
 I'd give anything to have you here with me 
 I get so lonesome all alone 
 She said come in, stranger 
 
 And won't you listen to my plea 
 Stay long enough, so that the one I love 
 Is not a stranger to me
 
 Come take a trip in my airship
 Come take a trip around the stars
 Come take a sail around Venus
 Come take a sail around Mars
 No one to watch while we're kissing
 No one to see while we spoon
 Come take a trip in my airship
 We'll visit the man in the moon
 
 It's a long and lonely highway.
 When you're traveling all alone.
 I was on my way to nowhere.
 But now I'm coming home.
 I'm coming home.
 
 I've been running through the fire.
 I've been running for so long.
 If I took it any higher.
 Baby I would be still be gone.
 
 And now I'm coming home,
 Coming home.
 I'm coming home.
 I'm coming home, coming home
 Coming home.
 
 Well my home was really never.
 On a far and distant shore.
 If I stayed away forever.
 I could never miss you more.
 
 And so I'm coming home,coming
 Home.
 I'm coming home.
 I'm coming home,coming home,
 Coming home.
 
 I think of all these years gone by.
 Never even wondered why.
 I never touched the ground.
 All the time that's come and gone.
 All the nights I've been alone.
 And now I'm homeward bound.
 
 I heard the thunder over canaan.
 And I heard the angels cry.
 And their voices came revealing
 As you live,so will you die.
 
 I'm coming home,coming home,
 I'm coming home.
 I'm coming home,coming home,
 Coming home.
 
 There's a man across the hall
 Who sits starin' at the floor
 And he thinks he's Hank Williams
 Hear him singin' through the door
 There's a girl in 202
 Who stops by to visit me
 And she talks about her songs
 And the star that she should be
 There's a lot of real fine talent
 Stayin' in or passin' through
 And for one thing or another
 They're committed to Parkview
 
 There's a girl in 207
 Comin' down on thorazine
 And a superstar's ex-drummer
 Tryin' to kick benzedrine
 There's a real fine country singer
 Who has tried and tried and tried
 They just brought him in this morning
 An attempted suicide
 There are those who never made it
 Those who did and now are through
 Some came of their own good choosin'
 Some committed to Parkview
 
 There's a girl who cries above me
 Loud enough to wake the dead
 They don't know what she has taken
 That has scrambled up her head
 There's a boy just down below me
 Who's the son of some well-known
 He was brought in by his mother
 'Cause his daddy's always gone
 There's a bum from down on broadway
 And a few quite well-to-do
 Who have withdrawn from the rat race
 And committed to Parkview
 
 They wake me about six-thirty
 Just before the morning meal
 While they're takin' my blood pressure
 They ask me how I feel
 And I always say "fantastic!"
 There ain't nothing wrong with me
 And then they give me my injection
 And I go right back to sleep
 And my days're kinda foggy
 And my nights're dreamy too
 For they're taking good care of me
 While committed to Parkview
 
 All day I've faced the barren waste 
 Without the taste of water, cool water 
 Old Dan and I with throats burned dry 
 And souls that cry for water, cool, clear water  
 
 Keep a-movin', 
 Dan, don't you listen to him, 
 Dan He's a devil not a man 
 And he spreads the burning sand with water 
 
 Dan can you see that big green tree 
 Where the water's runnin' free 
 And it's waiting there for you and me  
 The nights are cool and I'm a fool 
 
 Each star's a pool of water, cool water 
 But with the dawn I'll wake and yawn 
 And carry on to water, cool, clear, water  
 The shadows sway and seem to say 
 
 Tonight we pray for water, cool, water 
 And way up there He'll hear our prayer 
 And show us where there's water, cool, clear, water  
 Dan's feet are sore he's yearning for 
 Just one thing more than water, cool, water 
 Like me I guess he'd like to rest 
 Where there's no quest for water, cool, clear, water
 
 Country boy, ain't got no shoes
 Country boy, ain't got no blues
 Well, you work all day while you're waiting to play
 In the sun and the sand, with cheeks of tan
 at the end of the day, when your work is done
 You ain't got nothing but fun
 
 Country boy, ain't got no ills
 Country boy, don't owe no bills
 You got a wiggly worm and then you watch him squirm
 While you put him on a hook and you drop him in a brook
 If everything's gonna turn out right, you're gonna fry fish tonight
 
 Country boy, you got a lot to lose
 Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes
 
 Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
 Country boy, up a hollow log
 Well, he comes in a run, when you pick up your gun
 And with a shell or two, and your dog and you
 When you get your rabbit, you'll skin his hide
 He's gonna be good friend
 
 Country boy, you got a lot to lose
 Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes
 
 Country boy, you got work to do
 Country boy, in the morning dew
 You gotta plant the seed, you gotta cut the weeds
 There's many a row you know you gotta hoe
 When it's quitting time, and your work is through
 There's a lot if life in you
 
 Country boy, you lucky thing
 Country boy, I wish I was you, and you was me
 
 Country is sittin' on the back porch listen to the whippoorwills late in the day
 Country is mindin' your business helpin' a stranger if he comes your way
 Country is livin' in the city knowin' your people knowin' your kind
 Country is what you make it country is all in your mind
 
 Country is workin' for a living thinkin' your own thoughts lovin' your town
 Country is teachin' your children find out what's right and stand your ground
 Country is a havin' the good times listen to the music singing your part
 Country is walkin' in the moonlight country is all in your heart
 
 I got a crib full of corn and a turning plow
 But the ground's too wet for the hopper now
 Got a cultivator and a double tree
 A leather line for the haw and jean
 Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
 I'm doing alright for country trash
 
 I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day
 I got about a dollar laid away
 The wind's from the south and the fishing's good
 Got a potbelly stove a cord of wood
 Mama turns the left-overs into hash
 I'm doing alright for country trash
 
 I got a mackinaw wand a hunting dog
 A cap I ordered from the catalog
 A big tall tree that shades the yard
 A big fat sow for the winter's lard
 Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
 I'm doing alright for country trash
 
 Well there's not much new ground left to plow
 And crops need fertilizing now
 My hands don't earn me too much gold
 For security when I grow old
 But we'll all be equal under the grass
 And God's got a heaven for country trash
 God's got a heaven for country trash
 I'll be doing alright for country trash
 
 Cracklin' Rosie, get on board
 We're gonna ride till there ain't no more to go
 Taking it slow
 Lord, don't you know
 Have made me a time with a poor man's lady
 
 Hitchin' on a twilight train
 Ain't nothing there that I care to take along
 Maybe a song
 To sing when I want
 Don't need to say please to no man for a happy tune
 
 Oh, I love my Rosie child
 She got the way to make me happy
 You and me, we go in style
 Cracklin' Rose, you're a store bought woman
 You make me sing like a guitar hummin'
 So hang on to me, girl
 Our song keeps runnin' on
 
 Play it now
 Play it now, my baby
 
 Oh, I love my Rosie child
 You got the way to make me happy
 You and me, we go in style
 Cracklin' Rose, you're a store-baught woman
 You make me sing like a guitar hummin'
 So hang on to me, girl
 Our song keeps runnin' on
 
 Play it now
 Play it now
 Play it now, my baby
 
 I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so lonely 
 I'm crazy crazy for feeling so blue
 I knew that you'd love me as long as you wanted
 And then some day you'd leave me for somebody new
 
 Worry, why do I let myself worry 
 Wondering what in the world did I do
 I'm crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
 I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying 
 And I'm crazy for loving you
 I'm crazy for thinking
 
 Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel 
 That old storm brewing in this heart of mine 
 Someday crazy arms will hold somebody new 
 But now I'm so lonely all the time 
 
 Crazy arms that needs to hold somebody new 
 While your heart keeps sayin' your not mine not mine 
 Not mine not mine my troubled minds grows blue 
 To another you'll be wed but now I'm so lonely all the time 
 
 Now take all those precious dreams I had for you dear 
 And take all that love I thought was mine 
 Some day your crazy arms will hold somebody new 
 But now I 'm so lonely all the time 
 
 Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new 
 While my yearning heart keeps saying your not mine 
 Not mine not mine not mine my troubled mind goes blue 
 To another you'll be wed but now I'm so lonely all the time
 
 I've had fame and fortune
 Women come knock on my door
 I've lived to the limit
 Maybe a little bit more
 There are so many stories
 About how I got out of control
 Some say its a woman
 Some say its my troubled soul
 
 I'm like a crazy old soldier
 Fighting a war on my own
 Just me and the wiskey
 And the bottles are ten thousand strong
 You'd think I'd give up as many times I've been hit
 But like a crazy old soldier
 I just don't know when to quit
 
 Barrooms and bedrooms
 Are just faces and places and names
 Once for the pleasure
 And Lord knows once for the pain
 I've tried to forget her
 And all the things that we've done
 But as long as there are memories
 I'll never hang up my gun
 
 I'm like a crazy old soldier
 Fighting a war on my own
 Just me and the wiskey
 And the bottles are ten thousand strong
 You'd think I'd give up as many times as I've been hit
 But like a crazy old soilder
 I just don't know when to quit
 
 There was an error displaying these lyrics.
 
 This boxcar's been my home since St Antone
 'Cause this ankle of mine I turned while hoppin' on
 Shoots pain that feeds my dreams with luxuries
 I see crystal chandeliers and burgundy
 
 I can feel my mother's heartbeat from the track
 It's the rhythm of a son that won't be back
 Lord knows where my mind is takin' me
 I see crystal chandeliers and burgundy
 
 If that conductor only knew all the trouble I've been through
 Just to be here on this train once again
 Freedom of a hobo ain't so bad you can dream of all the wealth you might've had
 I guess livin' on this train is gettin' to me I see crystal chandeliers and burgundy
 
 If that conductor only knew all the trouble I've been through
 Just to be here on this train once again
 If there's nothing in this world I've gotta do
 But to ride these rails of steel my whole life through
 
 Then take away these visions that I see of crystal chandeliers and burgundy
 Of crystal chandeliers and burgundy
 
 
 Now I will tell you buster that I ain't a fan of Custer 
 And the General he don't ride well anymore 
 To some he was a hero but to me his score was zero 
 And the General he don't ride well anymore 
 Now Custer done his fightin' without too much excitin' 
 And the General he don't ride well anymore 
 General Custer come in pumpin' when the men were out a huntin' 
 But the General he don't ride well anymore 
 With victories he was swimmin' he killed children dogs and women 
 But the General he don't ride well anymore 
 Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall 
 And the General he don't ride well anymore 
 Now Custer split his men well he won't do that again 
 Cause the General he don't ride well anymore 
 Twelve thousand warriors waited they were unanticipated 
 And the General he don't ride well anymore 
 It's not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre 
 And the General he don't ride well anymore 
 There might have been more enthusin' if us Indians had been losin' 
 But the General he don't ride well anymore 
 General George A.Custer oh his yellow hair had lustre 
 But the General he don't ride well anymore 
 For now the General's silent he got barbered violent 
 And the General he don't ride well anymore 
 Oh the General he don't ride well anymore
 
 I remember when I was a lad
 Times were hard and things were bad
 But there's a silver linin' behind ev'ry cloud
 Just four people that 's all we were
 Tryin' to make a livin' out of black-land dirt
 But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud
 
 Daddy sang bass 
 Me and little brother would join right in there
 Singin' seems to help a troubled soul
 One of these days and it won't be long
 I'll rejoin them in a song
 I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne
 
 Though the circle won't be broken
 By and by, Lord, by and by
 Daddy sang bass 
 Me and little brother would join right in there
 In the sky, Lord, in the sky
 
 Now I remember after work mama would call in all of us
 You could hear us singin' for a country mile
 Now little brother has done gone on
 But I'll rejoin him in a song
 We'll be together again up yonder in a little while
 
 Daddy sang bass 
 Me and little brother would join right in there
 'Cause singin' seems to help a troubled soul
 One of these days and it won't be long
 I'll rejoin them in a song
 I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne
 
 Oh no the circle won't be broken
 By and by, Lord, by and by
 Daddy sang bass 
 Me and little brother would join right in there
 In the sky, Lord, in the sky
 
 In the sky, Lord, in the sky
 
 i remember when i was a lad

 Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
 From glen to glen and down the mountain side
 The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
 It's you, It's you, must go, and I must bide
 
 But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
 Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
 I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
 Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so
 
 But if you come, and all the flowers are dying
 And I am dead, as dead I well may be
 You'll come and find the place where I am lying
 And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me
 
 And I will know, tho' soft ye tread above me
 And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
 And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me
 And I will rest in peace until you come to me
 
 Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
 Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
 It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
 Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
 Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
 Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
 It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
 
 Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
 
 Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
 A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
 And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
 That my body would blacken and turn into coal
 Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner digging my bones
 Where it's dark as a dungeon
 
 What's that?
 Hey, what are you guys drinking in those tall, purple glasses?
 What is that, rot guts?
  Tea?
 
 Hey a little bit later on in the show
 I'm going to do you a brand new song
 That I wrote yesterday called San Quentin
 
 I'd like to ask my wife, June Carter, come back
 Come here June
 
 Hey, I wonder, I wonder if we can get Carl Perkins out to help us with this tine
 
 June and I have been singing this song, out version of a John Sebastian song
 Darling companion
 
 Darlin' companion, come on and give me understandin'.
 And let me be your champion, a hand to hold your pretty hand in.
 Darlin' companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned.
 Love will always light our landin', I can depend on you.
 
 Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed.
 Oh, a little bridlin' down from you is what I need.
 
 Darlin' companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned.
 Love will always light our landin', I can depend on you.
 
 Darlin' companion, come on and give me understandin'.
 As long as we keep laughin', bear in mind just what could happen.
 Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons,
 Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you.
 
 Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed.
 Oh, a little bridlin' down from you is what I need.
 
 Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons,
 Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you.
 
 Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons,
 Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you.
 
 Thank you very much
 
 Leaving in a cloud of burning cinders cinders from a fire of love gone out
 Never looking back when she's highbolling
 She's the daughter of a railroam man no doubt
 Waking in a new bed every morning breaking in a new heart every night
 Up and running while the world is sleeping
 She's the daughter of a railroam man alright
 She is long and sleek and made for moving she's outward bound at any time she can
 She won't be staying long in any station she's the daughter of a railroam man
 
 Cries out in the night when she gets lonely you can bet she won't be lonely long
 On down the line someone waits her arrival and the daughter of a railroad man is gone
 She is long and sleek
 
 
 Delia, oh, Delia
 Delia all my life
 If I hadn't shot poor Delia
 I'd have had her for my wife
 Delia's gone, one more round 
 Delia's gone
 
 I went up to Memphis
 And I met Delia there
 Found her in her parlor
 And I tied her to her chair
 Delia's gone, one more round 
 Delia's gone
 
 She was low down and trifling
 And she was cold and mean
 Kind of evil make me want to
 Grab my sub machine
 Delia's gone, one more round 
 Delia's gone
 
 First time I shot her
 I shot her in the side
 Hard to watch her suffer
 But with the second shot she died
 Delia's gone, one more round 
 Delia's gone
 
 But jailer, oh, jailer
 Jailer, I can't sleep
 'Cause all around my bedside
 I hear the patter of Delia's feet
 Delia's gone, one more round 
 Delia's gone
 
 So if your woman's devilish
 You can let her run 
 Or you can bring her down and do her
 Like Delia got done
 Delia's gone, one more round 
 Delia's gone
 Delia's gone, one more round 
 Delia's gone
 
 Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
 You been out ridin' fences for so long now.
 Oh, you're a hard one,
 But I know that you've got your reasons.
 These things that are pleasin' you,
 Can hurt you somehow.
 
 Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy,
 She'll beat you if she's able.
 Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
 Now it seems to me, some fine things,
 Have been laid upon your table.
 But you only want the things that you can't get.
 
 Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger,
 Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home.
 And freedom, oh freedom,
 Well, that's just some people talkin'
 Your prison is walking,
 Through this world all alone.
 
 And don't your feet get cold in the winter time?
 The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
 It's hard to tell the night time from the day
 You're loosin' all your highs and lows
 Ain't it funny how the feeling goes away?
 
 Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
 Come down from your fences, and open the gate
 It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you,
 You better let somebody love you,
 You better let somebody love you,
 You better let somebody love you,
 Before it's too late.
 
 I'd play the Red River Valley
 And he'd sit out in the kitchen and cry
 And run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
 And wonder, "Lord, has ever' well I've drilled run dry?"
 
 We were friends, me and this old man
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 
 He's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
 And an old school man of the world
 He let me drive his car
 When he's too drunk to
 
 And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
 And our lives were like some old western movie
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 
 From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
 To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
 There were old men with beer guts and dominos
 Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played
 
 And I was just a kid
 They all called his "Sidekick"
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 
 One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
 And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
 To me he's one of the heroes of this country
 So why's he all dressed up like them old men
 
 Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 
 A day before he died, I went to see him
 I was grown and he was almost gone
 So we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
 And sang another verse to that old song
 "Come on, Jack, that son of a guns are comin' "
 
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 Like desperados waitin' for a train
 
 Devil Went Down to Georgia
 
 It's been ten long years since 
 The devil laid his fiddle at Johnny's feet
 And it burned inside his mind 
 The way he suffered that defeat
 In the darkest pits of hell 
 The devil hatched an evil plan
 To tempt the fiddle player for 
 He's just a mortal man
 "The sin of pride," the devil 
 Cried is what will do you in
 "I thought we had this settled, 
 I'm the best there's ever been."
 
 Johnny did you ever know 
 That time keeps marching on
 The coldest hour is the one 
 Comes just before the dawn
 The devil's back in Georgia 
 Will you stand up to the test
 Or will you let the devil be the best?
 
 "In truth I haven't played much 
 Since the baby came in June
 But give me half a minute an' 
 I'll get this fiddle back in tune"
 
 The devil grabbed the golden 
 Fiddle out of Johnny's hand and said
 "Though I'm the fiddle player 
 Underground and I walk upon the land"
 
 "Y'all just better be just turnin' 
 Back if you want this boy to win
 'Cos practice is the only cure for 
 The predicament he's in"
 
 "Now devil it would be a sin 
 For you to get my bow
 You go on back to hell and to 
 The wood shed I will go"
 
 Johnny are you practising or 
 Will your hands grow cold?
 The devil walks the land and 
 Plays a fiddle made of gold
 Can you hear the babe a crying, 
 Will he ever know
 The devil wants his daddy's very soul?
 
 "Before we play I want to 
 Thank you for letting God's 
 Own Word ring true
 He said you can't be trusted" 
 "Yes but what you gonna do?"
 "Well you get your fiddle devil if 
 You think that you can win
 'Cos I beat you once you old dog 
 And I can whip your butt again"
 
 John Brown's green, the devil is red
 Mama's little baby loves short-nymph bread
 The devil's dream is that he can win
 But Johnny is the best that's ever been
 
 
 Well, we would like to, I'd like to do a couple of
 Of love songs here for you now.
 One, you know the man's best friend is his dog, if he's got nothing else
 And uh, this song is about a dog
 
 Well he's not very handsome to look at
 Oh he's shaggy and he eats like a hog
 And he's always killin' my chickens
 That dirty old egg-suckin' dog
 
 Egg-suckin' dog
 I'm gonna stomp your head in the ground
 If you don't stay out of my hen house
 You dirty old egg-suckin' hound
 
 Now if he don't stop eatin' my eggs up
 Though I'm not a real bad guy
 I'm gonna get my riffle and send him
 To that great chicken house in the sky
 
 Do Lord, O, Do Lord, O do remember me 
 Way beyond the blue.
 
 I've got a home in glory land that out-shines the sun. 
 Way beyond the blue.
 
 I took Jesus as my Savior, you take Him too. 
 Way beyond the blue.
 
 On this rock pile, with my ball and chain
 They call me by a number not a name Lord, Lord
 
 Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
 With an aching heart, on that gal of mine
 
 You can here my hammer, you can hear my saw
 Gonna sing it like John Henry all day long Lord, Lord
 
 Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
 With an aching heart, on that gal of mine
 
 When that old judge looked down at me
 Said I put you in that penitentiary Lord, Lord
 
 Gotta do my time, I gotta do my time
 With an aching heart, on that gal of mine
 
 Well now it won't be long, just a few more days
 They'll let me out of here I'm gonna stay Lord, Lord
 
 With that gal of mine, with that gal of mine
 She's a waited for me while I've done my time
 
 You know I can be found,
 Sitting home all alone,
 If you can't come around,
 At least please telephone.
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
 
 Baby, if I made you mad
 For something I might have said,
 Please, let's forget the past,
 The future looks bright ahead,
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
 I don't want no other love,
 Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.
 
 Don't stop thinking of me,
 Don't make me feel this way,
 Come on over here and love me,
 You know what I want you to say.
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
 Why should we be apart?
 I really love you baby, cross my heart.
 
 Let's walk up to the preacher
 And let us say I do,
 Then you'll know you'll have me,
 And I'll know that I'll have you,
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
 I don't want no other love,
 Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.
 
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
 Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
 I don't want no other love,
 Baby it's just you I'm thinking of.
 
 Don't-a forbid me to hold you tight 
 Darling, don't forbid me to hold you tight
 Let-a me hold you in my lovin' arms
 'Cause it's cold and I can keep you warm
 
 Don't a forbid me to kiss your lips 
 Darling, don't forbid me to kiss your lips
 Let-a me kiss you please baby, please
 'Cause it's cold and your lips might freeze
 There's a strong westwind a-blowing 
 And there's a big, blue moon above
 And, pretty baby, I'll be knowing 
 You need some heartwarming love
 So don't-a forbid me to talk sweet talk
 Darling, don't forbid me to talk sweet talk
 Let-a me fill your little heart with fire
 
 From the fountains in the mountains
 Comes the water running cool and clear and blue
 And it comes down from the hills
 And it goes down to the towns and passes through
 
 When it gets down to the cities
 Then the water turns into a dirty gray
 It's poisoned and polluted
 By the people as it goes along its way
 
 Don't go near the water children
 See the fish all dead upon the shore
 Don't go near the water
 'Cause the water isn't water anymore
 
 I took my boy fishin' to my old favorite fishin' hole
 I had caught many a fish out of that deep clear water
 From the time I was a boy like him
 After we'd fished a few minutes
 He said, "Did you get a bite yet daddy?"
 I said, "I think I got a nibble son"
 "Me too", he said
 Then he said, "Daddy if we catch a fish can we eat him"
 I said, "Well there was a time son
 This water's bad now and I might not be safe to eat the fish
 But there was a time"
 
 There was a time the air was clean
 And you could see forever 'cross the plains
 The wind was sweet as honey
 And no one had ever heard of acid rain
 
 We're torturin' the earth
 And pourin' every kind of evil in the sea
 We violated nature
 And our children have to pay the penalty
 
 Don't go near the water children
 See the fish all dead upon the shore
 Don't go near the water
 'Cause the water isn't water anymore
 
 Don't go near the water children
 See the fish all dead upon the shore
 Don't go near the water
 'Cause the water isn't water anymore
 
 You take my hand and smile at me
 But I can tell you'd rather be
 Alone or with somebody else you know
 
 And when your eyes are looking to mine
 That old time love light doesn't shine
 But let me try again, don't make me go
 
 I want you don't make me go 
 My heart would break, I'd miss you so
 Tradin' love for sympathy is old to me
 What's this lovesick heart to do when it cries for only you
 Hold me close I love you so, don't make me go
 
 I'm sorry that I never knew the way to show my love for you
 I took too much for granted all the time
 Two hearts in love must give and take
 When one heart fails the other breaks
 Don't make me go I wanna show this love of mine
 
 I want you, don't make me go
 My heart would break, I'd miss you so
 Tradin' love for sympathy is old to me
 What's this lovesick heart to do when it cries for only you
 Hold me close I love you so, don't make me go
 
 We all were called to come back to the old home on the farm 
 Mother's passed away what a mournful day 
 And as my daddy watched his eyes were filled with pain and hurt 
 When someone stepped upon a rose and crush it in the dirt 
 Don't step on mother's roses daddy cried she planted them the day she was my bride 
 And everytime I see a rose I see her smilin' face 
 She made my darkest days look bright round the old homeplace 
 Don't step on mother's roses let them grow 
 The way they did since many years ago 
 They'll bloom for me each year and I'll have mother near 
 Don't step on mother's roses let them grow 
 Years have passed away and how the old homeplace has changed 
 Daddy had to go we all miss him so 
 Children pick the roses as they go along the way 
 But when their petals are abused I hear my daddy say 
 Don't step on mother's roses...
 
 A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm
 A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm
 He changed his clothes and shined his boots
 And combed his dark hair down
 And his mother cried as he walked out
 
 Don't take your guns to town son
 Leave your guns at home Bill
 Don't take your guns to town
 
 He laughed and kissed his mom
 And said your Billy Joe's a man
 I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can
 But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
 I'd gun nobody down
 But she cried again as he rode away
 
 Don't take your guns to town son
 Leave your guns at home Bill
 Don't take your guns to town
 
 He sang a song as on he rode
 His guns hung at his hips
 He rode into a cattle town
 A smile upon his lips
 He stopped and walked into a bar
 And laid his money down
 But his mother's words echoed again
 
 Don't take your guns to town son
 Leave your guns at home Bill
 Don't take your guns to town
 
 He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
 And tried to tell himself he had at last he had become a man
 A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
 And he heard again his mothers words
 
 Don't take your guns to town son
 Leave your guns at home Bill
 Don't take your guns to town
 
 Filled with rage then
 Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
 But the stranger drew his gun and fired
 Before he even saw
 As Billy Joe fell to the floor
 The crowd all gathered 'round
 And wondered at his final words
 
 Don't take your guns to town son
 Leave your guns at home Bill
 Don't take your guns to town
 
 Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 If you don't know by now
 An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, baby
 It'll never do anywhow
 When your rooster's a-crowin' at the break of dawn
 Look out your window and I'll be gone
 You're the reason why I'm trav'lin' on
 But don't think twice, it's all right
 And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
 The light I never knowed
 An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
 I'm on the dark side of the road
 But I wish there was somethin' I could do or say
 To try and make you change your mind and stay
 We never did too much talkin' anyway
 But don't think twice, it's all right
 Well, it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
 Like you never done before
 It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
 I can't hear you any more
 I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin', walkin' down the road
 I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
 I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
 But don't think twice, it's all right
 So long, honey baby
 Where I'm bound, I can't tell
 But goodbye's too good a word, gal
 So I'll just kind of say fare thee well
 Now, I'm not sayin' you treated me unkind
 You could have done better but I don't mind
 You just kinda wasted my precious time
 But don't think twice, it's all right
 
 I have picked wild roses
 Far into September
 But I had no one to give the flowers to
 I needed the celebration
 of September coronation
 And I admitted to myself I needed you
 
 I've watched the gentle winds change
 The colored shades of meadows
 I've seen the dillon flowers
 That had no name
 But I let my vase stay empty
 Like my old and empty heart
 Picking flowers for yourself is not the same
 
 Don't you think its come our time to be together
 Lets gather up our scattered words of love
 And make them rhyme
 
 Lets go pick some flowers and fill our empty vases
 
 Don't you think its come our time?
 
 Would you take the small bouquet that leaves a fragrance on my fingers
 And the feeling that your love is close at hand
 
 Thank you for the flowers
 Now lets walk through the meadows
 To the road where our divines caress the sand
 
 Don't you think its come our time to be together
 Lets gather up our scattered words of love
 And make them rhyme
 
 Lets go pick some flowers now and fill our empty vases
 
 Don't you think its come our time?
 Don't you think its come our time?

 I took Jesus as my Savior, You take Him too.
 I took Jesus as my Savior, You take Him too, while He's still calling you.

 I took Jesus as my Savior, You take Him too.
 I took Jesus as my Savior, You take Him too.

 As I walked by the lake one day by chance my Dorraine passed my way 
 Then she and I walked hand in hand on the banks of Ponchartrain 
 I pinned a flower on her heart I swore we'd never be apart 
 She vowed her love forever and as I kissed her did the same 
 Dorraine my Dorraine my fair haired little angel my belle of Ponchartrain 
 We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked 
 We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same 
 And joking I said honey are you marrying me for money 
 And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine 
 She jumped and stood above me and she cried why you don't love me 
 I'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again 
 I called and called some more but she rowed fast from the shore 
 And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Ponchartrain 
 Dorraine I called Dorraine come back my little angel my belle of Ponchartrain 
 The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return 
 But as the rain fell harder I lost sight of my Dorraine 
 As panic gripped my heart I drew the oars and made my start 
 To look for her on raging waters and the rain on Ponchartrain 
 At darkness I still called but no one heard my cries at all 
 And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine 
 But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat 
 For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Ponchartrain 
 Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away 
 And I gaze across the water of the rainy Ponchartrain 
 Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore 
 Twas this flower I hold it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine 
 Dorraine my Dorraine my fair haired little angel my belle of Ponchartrain
 
 Campers bikes and mobile homes cars and pickup trucks
 Slacks and '59 hairdoes sideburns spears and ducks
 There's lone star pearl and fried chicken and one big cloud of smoke
 Plug it in and turn it on and the music goes for broke
 
 Down at Drippin' Springs down at Drippin' Springs

 Duncan's on and Linda's next time many did Joel Gray down at Drippin' Springs
 
 Well the Texas sun is low and hot upon the chaparral
 It would be one ideal spot for God to put his hell
 The most beloved cowboys songs echoe cross the plains
 T Texas Tyler ain't forgotten next year y'all come again
 
 Down at Drippin' Springs Down at Drippin' Springs

 Gonna drive those cool cats wild
 
 I'm gonna move, move on down the line
 Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine
 
 Oh I'm gonna show you a-way so hot

 Gonna roll, roll on down the line
 Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine
 
 Yeah, move 
 I'm gonna move

 I guess there's not much I can do or say saw my baby with another guy today
 Though I love her and I tried to tell her so it's hello blues and down the road I go
 I've never seen that guy before today he held my baby in the closest way
 And the way she snuggled close to him I know it's hello blues and down the road I go
 
 Well it seems our thoughts were much alike our likes were much the same
 We even had our future plan 'til into town he came
 I've never seen that guy
 
 Well it seems our thoughts
 
 There's a boy across the street, lately he's looked very neat
 Seems he's always on the run, down the street to 301
 
 Saturday he mows the lawn, it's about a crack of dawn
 Nine o'clock the work's all done, down the street to 301
 
 When it's back to school this fall, winter's chill may end it all
 But for now there's lots of fun, with the girl at 301
 
 Maybe they will never wed, sure they may break up instead
 But for now she is the one, the girl who lives at 301
 
 The boy who lives across the street has a reason to be neat
 He's in love and on the run, with the girl at 301
 
 Don't you tell 'em to beware of a summer love affair
 You know she's his only one, the girl that lives at 301
 
 There's a place I know where the train goes slow 
 Where the sinner can be washed in the blood of the lamb 
 There's a river by the trestle down by sinner's grove 
 Down where the willow and the dogwood grow
 
 You can hear the whistle, you can hear the bell 
 From the halls of heaven to the gates of hell 
 And there's room for the forsaken, if you're there on time 
 You'll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes 
 If you're down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there where the train goes slow
 
 There's a golden moon that shines up through the mist 
 And I know that your name can be on that list 
 There's no eye for an eye, there's no tooth for a tooth 
 I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth 
 He was down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 He was down there where the train goes slow
 
 If you've lost all your hope, if you've lost all your faith 
 I know you can be cared for and I know you can be safe 
 And all the shamefuls and all of the whores 
 And even the soldier who pierced the side of the Lord 
 Is down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there where the train goes slow
 
 Well, I've never asked forgiveness and I've never said a prayer 
 Never given of myself, never truly cared 
 I've left the ones who loved me and I'm still raising Cain 
 I've taken the low road and if you've done the same 
 Meet me down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there where the train goes slow
 
 Meet me down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there by the train 
 Down there where the train goes slow
 
  
 A rose a carnation the lily and an orchid make such a pretty bouquet 
 But only the orchid was worthy of you so I threw all the others away 
 Then you took the orchid and you breathed on its petals and after a day or two 
 The flower still blooms but it scents not the orchids it carries the savor of you 
  
 
 So if you're gonna drink to me drink with your eyes and I'll never cry for wine 
 Or leave a kiss in an empty coffee cup then pass it from your lips to mine 
 Cause I've got a thirst burning way down in my soul and honey from a sugar tree 
 Is not half as sweet as the air that you breathe 
 Honey come here and drink to me drink to me drink to me 
 
 Drink to me only with thine eyes
 And I will pledge with mine.
 Or leave a kiss within the cup
 And I'll not ask for wine.
 The thirst that from the soul doth rise
 Doth ask a drink divine;
 But might I of Jove's nectar sip,
 I would not change for thine.
 
 I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
 Not so much hon'ring thee
 As giving it a hope that there
 It could not withered be;
 But thou thereon did'st only breathe,
 And sent'st it back to me,
 Since when it grows and smells, I swear
 Not of itself, but thee.
 
 Drink to me only with thine eyes
 And I will pledge with mine.
 Or leave a kiss within the cup
 And I'll not ask for wine.
 The thirst that from the soul doth rise
 Doth ask a drink divine;
 But might I of Jove's nectar sip,
 I would not change for thine.
 
 Well, I got a friend named Whiskey Sam
 He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam
 He said I think my country got a little off track
 Took 'em twenty five years to welcome me back
 But, it's better than not comin' back at all
 Many a good men I saw fall
 And even now, every time I dream
 I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream
 
 Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
 My children love me, but they don't understand
 And I got a woman who knows her man
 Drive on, don't mean nothin', and don't mean nothin' 
 Drive on
 
 What I remember one night, Tex and me
 Rappelled in on a hot L.Z.
 We had our sixteen's on rock and roll
 And with all that fire, I was scared and cold
 I was crazy, and I was wild
 And I have seen the tiger smile
 I spit in a bamboo viper's face
 And I'd be dead, but by God's grace
 
 Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
 My children love me, but they don't understand
 And I got a woman who knows her man
 Drive on, it don't mean nothin', and don't mean nothin' 
 Drive on
 
 It was a slow walk in a sad rain
 And nobody tried to be John Wayne
 I came home, but Tex did not
 And I can't talk about the hit he got
 But I got a little limp now when I walk
 And I got a little tremolo when I talk
 But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
 You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam
 
 Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
 My children love me, but they don't understand
 And I got a woman who knows her man
 Drive on, it don't mean nothin', it don't mean nothin' 
 Drive on
 
 From the Indian reservation to the governmental school
 Well they're goin' to educate me to the white men's Golden Rule
 And I'm learning very quickly for I've learned to be ashamed
 And I come when they call Billy though I've got an Indian name
 And there are drums beyond the mountain Indian drums that you can't hear
 There are drums beyond the mountain and they're getting mighty near
 And when they think that they'd changed me cut my hair to meet their needs
 Will they think I'm white or Indian quarter blood or just half breed
 Let me tell you Mr teacher when you say you'll make me right
 In five hundred years of fighting not one Indian turned white
 And there are drums...
 Well you thought that I knew nothing when you brought me here to school
 Just another empty Indian just America's first fool
 But now I can tell you stories that are burnt and dried and old
 But in the shadow of their telling walks the thunder proud and bold
 And there are drums...
 Long Pine and Sequoia Handsome Lake and Sitting Bull
 There's Magnus Colorado with his sleeves so red and full
 Crazy Horse the legend those who bit off Custer's soul
 They are dead yet they are living with the great Geronimo
 And there are drums...
 Well you may teach me this land's hist'ry but we taught it to you first
 We broke your hearts and bent your journeys broken treaties left us cursed
 Even now you have to cheat us even though you this us tame
 In our losing we found proudness in your winning you found shame
 And there are drums...
 
 The crowd is waiting for the bullfight
 Matador
 My final fight the place is packed once more
 But Anita won't throw me a rose this fight
 The one she wears is not for me tonight
 
 She's watching now with her new love I know
 Walk proud and slow
 Be strong and sure give the crowd a show
 They want blood you know!
 You're still their idol as you were before
 Kill just one more!
 Remind Anita, you're the greatest Matador
 
 The time is come, forget Anita in the stands
 Be a tall and strong and brave and noble man
 Be better than you've never been before
 Make this your greatest moment Matador
 
 She's watching now with her new love I know
 Walk proud and slow
 Be strong and sure give the crowd a show
 They want blood you know!
 You're still their idol as you were before
 Kill just one more!
 Remind Anita, you're the greatest Matador
 
 Well the way is dark 
 The night is long 
 I don't care if I never get home 
 I'm waiting 
 
 At the end of the road 
 Well the stars may not shine 
 Neither the moon 
 What the heck we don't want no moon 
 
 I'm waiting 
 At the end of the road 
 You can jump in my Ford and give it some gas 
 Pull out the front, don't give me no sass 
 
 Take your foot slap it on the floor 
 When you get ahead we'll rock some more 
 Oh the way is dark 
 The night is long 
 
 I don't care if I never get home 
 I'm waiting 
 At the end of the road 
 You can jump in my Ford and give it some gas 
 
 Flip out the front, don't give me no sass 
 Take your foot slap it on the floor 
 When you get ahead we'll rock some more 
 Well the way is dark 
 
 The night is long 
 I don't care if I never get home 
 I'm waiting 
 At the end of the road
 
 Along came the FFV the swiftest on the line
 Running o'er the C&O road just twenty minutes behind
 Running into Sou'ville headquarters on the line
 Receiving there strict orders from a station just behind
 
 Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm
 Saying my darling son be careful how you run
 For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time
 And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time
 
 Up the road he darted against the rocks he crashed
 Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast was smashed
 His head lay against the firebox door the flames were rolling high
 I'm glad to be born for an engineer on the C&O road to die
 
 The doctor said to Georgie my darling boy lie still
 Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will
 Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free
 I want to die with the engine I love one hundred and forty three
 
 The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved
 Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave
 His face was covered up with blood his eyes they could not see
 And the very last words poor Georgie said was nearer my God to thee
 
 Everybody loves a nut
 The whole world loves a weirdo
 Brains are in a rut
 But everybody loves a nut
 
 There was a hermit named Fred
 Who kept the dead horse in his cave
 And everyone said to Fred
 "Fred, how come you keep a dead horse
 In your cave?", and he said, "Well"
 
 Brains are in a rut but everybody loves a nut
 A Columbia man named Frank
 Had a tiger named Hank
 
 He tried to put Hank in his tank
 Guess what happened to ol' Frank
 When they picked up the teets there and eyeballs
 And erected a tombstone that read
 
 Another Columbia fella told queen Isabella
 I don't think the world is flat
 And now what do you think about that
 
 And she said
 "You don't", and he said, "No mam"
 And she said
 "He'd get out of my queendom"
 And he said, "Yes mam"
 
 Everybody loves a nut
 
 Well they took a little honey from a honey tree
 They dressed it up and they called at me
 
 Now everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
 
 Well half past nine and half past four
 Fifty women knocking on my door
 
 And everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
 
 I went out last night, I didn't stay late
 'Fore I got home I had nineteen dates
 
 And everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
 
 Me and my girl, sittin' in the shade
 Talking about the money that she has made
 
 And everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
 Get down
 
 Everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby
 Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
 
 There's a family Bible on the table
 Its pages worn and hard to read
 But the family Bible on the table
 Will ever be my key to memories
 
 At the end of day when work was over
 And when the evening meal was done
 Dad would read to us from the family Bible
 And we'd count our many blessings one by one
 
 I can see us sittin' round the table
 When from the family Bible dad would read
 And I can hear my mother softly singing
 Rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me
 
 Now this old world of ours is filled with trouble
 This old world would also better be
 If we'd found more Bibles on the tables
 And mothers singing, rock of ages cleft for me
 
 I can see us sittin' round the table
 When from the family Bible dad would read
 And I can hear my mother softly singing
 Rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me
 Rock of ages, rock of ages cleft for me
 
 Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day long 
 While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong 
 Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why 
 Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by 
 
 When we see Jesus coming in glory when he comes from his home in the sky 
 Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion we'll understand it all by and by 
 Farther along
 
 Oh, I am a cheat and I'm a liar, oh, but you're a lovin' ball of fire
 I'll leave you like a bum without a penny
 And while I'm home with the blues, I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo
 When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney
 
 I said, listen to me, baby, I gave up the lovin' trade
 I'm tired of all this runnin', jumpin', playin'
 But you're like it down under the world with the Australian girls
 And there's not a word of truth in what you're sayin'
 
 Oh, but I am a cheat and I'm a liar and you're a lovin' ball of fire
 Honey, I'll leave you like a bum without a penny
 And while I'm home with the blues, I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo
 When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney
 
 This is my greatest act, I've come boomerangin' back
 Grinnin' like a Rudolf Valentino
 But then you grab your travel load like a swingin' grimmin' dog
 And hopped on that fast boat to Sydney
 
 'Cause I'm a cheat and I'm a liar but you're a lovin' ball of fire
 Honey, I'll leave you like a bum without a penny
 And while I'm home with the blues, I'll be hopin' like a kangaroo
 When I get off of that fast boat to Sydney
 
 It's not time to make a change just relax and take it easy
 You're still young that's your fault there's so much you have to know
 Find a boy settle down and if you want you can marry
 Look at me gettin' old but I'm happy
 
 I was once like you are now and I know that it's not easy
 To be calm when you found somethin' going on
 But take your time think a lot why think of every thing you've got
 For you'll still be here tomorrow but your dreams may not
 
 How can I try to explain cause when I do he turns away again
 And it's always been the same same old story
 From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
 Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away
 
 It's not time to make a change just sit down and take it slowly
 You're still young that's your fault there's so much you have to go through
 Find a boy settle down and if you want you can marry
 Look at me gettin' old but I'm happy
 
 All the times that I have cried keeping all the things I knew inside
 It's hard but it's harder to ignore it 
 If they were right I'd agree but it's them that know not me
 Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away I know I have to go away
 
 It's not time to make a change,
 Just relax, take it easy.
 You're still young, that's your fault,
 There's so much you have to know.
 Find a girl, settle down,
 If you want you can marry.
 Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.
 
 I was once like you are now
 And I know that it's not easy,
 To be calm when you've found
 Something going on.
 But take your time, think a lot,
 Why, think of everything you've got.
 For you will still be here tomorrow
 But your dreams may not.
 
 How can I try to explain
 When I do he turns away again
 It's always been the same, same old story.
 From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen.
 Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.
 I know I have to go.
 
 It's not time to make a change,
 Just sit down, take it slowly.
 You're still young, that's your fault,
 There's so much you have to go through.
 Find a girl, settle down,
 If you want you can marry.
 Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.
 
 All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside,
 It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it.
 If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them you know not me.
 Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.
 I know I have to go.
 
 Field of diamonds in the sky
 Worlds are whirling right on by
 Are you wondering who am I
 Field of diamonds in the sky
 
 Am I just a star in some crown
 Or someone's live sun going down, down, down
 
 Field of diamonds in the sky
 Silent beauty shining high
 Are you tears the angels cry
 Field of diamonds in the sky
 
 Field of diamonds in the sky
 Like the nihgt you pass me by
 I could touch you if I try
 Field of diamonds in the sky
 
 Am I just a star in some crown
 Or someone's live sun going down, down, down
 
 Field of diamonds in the sky
 Silent beauty shining high
 Are you tears the angels cry
 Field of diamonds in the sky
 
 The first time ever I saw your face
 I thought the sun rose in your eyes
 And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
 To the dark and the endless sky my love
 
 And the first time ever I kissed your mouth
 I felt the earth move through my hands
 Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
 That was there at my command
 
 And the first time ever I lay with you
 I felt your heart so close to mine
 And I know our joy would fill the earth
 And last 'till the end of time my love
 
 The first time ever I saw your face
 
 How high's the water, mama?
 Two feet high and risin'
 How high's the water, papa?
 She said it's two feet high and risin'
 
 We can make it to the road in a homemade boat
 That's the only thing we got left that'll float
 It's already over all the wheat and oats,
 Two feet high and risin'
 
 How high's the water, mama?
 Three feet high and risin'
 How high's the water, papa?
 She said it's three feet high and risin'
 
 Well, the hives are gone,
 I lost my bees
 The chickens are sleepin'
 In the willow trees
 Cow's in water up past her knees,
 Three feet high and risin'
 
 How high's the water, mama?
 Four feet high and risin'
 How high's the water, papa?
 She said it's four feet high and risin'
 
 Hey, come look through the window pane,
 The bus is coin', gonna take us to the train
 Looks like we'll be blessed with a little more rain,
 Four feet high and risin'
 
 How high's the water, mama?
 Five feet high and risin'
 How high's the water, papa?
 She said it's five feet high and risin'
 
 Well the rails are washed out north of town
 We gotta head for higher ground
 We can't come back till the water goes down,
 Five feet high and risin'
 
 Well, it's five feet high and risin'
 
 Beside a singing mountain stream
 Where the willow grew
 
 Where the silver leaf of maple
 Sparkled in the morning dew
 I braided twigs of willows
 Made a string of buckeye beads
 But flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
 And you're the one I need
 Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
 And you're the one I need
 
 I leaned against a bark of birch
 And I breathed the honey dew
 I saw a North-bound flock of geese
 Against a sky of baby blue
 Beside the lily pads
 I carved a whistle from a reed
 Mother Nature's quite a lady
 But you're the one I need
 Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
 And you're the one I need
 
 A cardinal sang just for me
 And I thanked him for the song
 Then the sun went slowly down the west
 And I had to move along
 These were some of the things
 On which my mind and spirit feed
 But flesh and blood need flesh and blood
 And you're the one I need
 Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
 And you're the one I need
 
 So when this day was ended
 I was still not satisfied
 For I knew everything I touched
 Would wither and would die
 And love is all that will remain
 And grow from all these seeds
 Mother Nature's quite a lady
 But you're the one I need
 Flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
 And you're the one I need
 
 I keep hearin' you're concerned about my happiness
 But all that thought you're givin' me is conscience I guess
 If I was walkin' in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
 While you 'n' your friends are worried about me I'm havin' lots of fun
 
 Countin' flowers on the wall
 That don't bother me at all
 Playin' solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty-one
 Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
 Now don't tell me I've nothin' to do
 
 Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
 As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
 So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
 You can always find me here, I'm havin' quite a time
 
 Countin' flowers on the wall
 That don't bother me at all
 Playin' solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty-one
 Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
 Now don't tell me I've nothin' to do
 
 It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
 Anyway my eyes are not accustomed to this light
 And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
 So I must go back to my room and make my day complete
 
 Countin' flowers on the wall
 That don't bother me at all
 Playin' solitaire till dawn with a deck of fifty-one
 Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
 Now don't tell me I've nothin' to do
 
 Don't tell me I've nothin' to do
 
 From the backdoor of your life you swept me out dear
 In the bread line of your dreams I lost my place
 At the table of your love I got the brush off
 At the Indianapolis of your heart I lost the race
 
 I've been washed down the sink of your conscience
 In the theater of your love I lost my part
 And now you say you've got me out of your conscience
 I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart
 
 In the garbage disposal of you dreams I've been ground up dear
 On the river of your plans I'm up the creek
 Up the elevator of your future I've been shafted
 On the calendar of your events I'm last week
 
 I've been washed down the sink of your conscience
 In the theater of your love I lost my part
 And now you say you've got me out of your conscience
 I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart
 
 I hear the train a comin'
 It's rollin' 'round the bend
 And I ain't seen the sunshine
 Since, I don't know when
 I'm stuck in Folsom Prison
 And time keeps draggin' on
 But that train keeps a-rollin'
 On down to San Antone
 
 When I was just a baby
 My Mama told me, son
 Always be a good boy
 Don't ever play with guns
 But I shot a man in Reno
 Just to watch him die
 When I hear that whistle blowin'
 I hang my head and cry
 
 I bet there's rich folks eatin'
 In a fancy dining car
 They're probably drinkin' coffee
 And smokin' big cigars
 But I know I had it comin'
 I know I can't be free
 But those people keep a-movin'
 And that's what tortures me
 
 Well, if they freed me from this prison
 If that railroad train was mine
 I bet I'd move out over a little
 Farther down the line
 Far from Folsom Prison
 That's where I want to stay
 And I'd let that lonesome whistle
 Blow my blues away
 
 Well if I live to be a hundred, I won't forget the day
 I broke the heart you gave me and let you walk away
 That's when they hung my name in the fool's hall of fame
 
 Ah baby since we've been apart, I can't console my heart
 It cries and cries all night long
 Can't I ever make you see this change you've made in me
 Just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong
 
 Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery
 you know I'll keep on a beggin' till you come back to me
 don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame
 
 Ah baby since we've been apart I can't console my heart
 it cries and cries all night long
 Baby can't you ever see the change you've made in me
 just give me a chance to tell you I was wrong
 
 Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery
 You know I'll keep on beggin' till you come back to me
 don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame
 don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame
 
 Yes they say that you'll forgive me and end this misery
 You know I'll keep on beggin' till you come back to me
 don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame
 don't leave me here in chains in the fool's hall of fame
 
 That's what you get for lovin' me that's what you get for lovin' me
 Everything you have is gone that you can see that's what you get for lovin' me
 
 I ain't the kind to hang aroung with any new love that I found
 Movin' is my stock and trade I'm movin' on I won't think of you when I'm gone
 So don't you shed a tear for me I ain't the love you thought I'd be
 I've got a hundred more like you so don't be blue
 I'll have a thousand fore I'm through
 
 Now there you go you're cryin' again now there you go you're cryin' again
 But then someday your poor heart is on the mend I just might pass your way again
 
 That's what you get for lovin' me
 That's what you get for lovin' me that's what you get for lovin' me
 
 Don't look so sad, I know it's over.
 But life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning.
 Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together.
 There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning.
 
 Lay your head upon my pillow.
 Hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
 Hear the whisper of the raindrops,
 Blowin' soft against the window,
 And make believe you love me one more time,
 For the good times.
 
 I'll get along; you'll find another,
 And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me.
 Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever,
 There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me.
 
 Lay your head upon my pillow.
 Hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
 Hear the whisper of the raindrops,
 Blowin' soft against the window,
 And make believe you love me one more time,
 For the good times.
 
 This world that I live in is empty and cold
 This loneliness cuts me and tears at my soul
 I'm no child of destiny, no fortune's son
 I've just chased you so long now, I'm too weak to run
 
 So here I return to a back street of thrills
 Back to any warm shoulder till she's got her fill
 And then I treat shame like an old friend from home
 That I can lean on till the misery is gone
 
 A new day is here yet nothing is new
 You're still gone and I tremble for you
 
 I cry out at bedtime no, please not tonight
 But again there's your footsteps and I turn on the light
 Of course you're not there, no, you never are
 Then I try to forget that there's always a bar
 
 And well, I win that battle, yes, sometimes I do
 But sleep doesn't come when I tremble for you
 
 May God's bless and keep you always
 May your wishes all come true
 May you always do for others
 And let others do for you
 May you build a ladder to the stars
 And climb on every rung
 May you stay
 May you stay forever young
 
 Forever young
 Forever young
 May you stay
 Stay forever young
 
 May you grow up to be righteous
 May you grow up to be true
 May you always know the truth
 And see the lights surrounding you
 
 May you always be courageous
 Stand upright and be strong
 May you stay
 May you stay forever young
 
 Forever young
 Forever young
 May you stay
 Stay forever young
 
 May your hands always be busy
 May your feet always be swift
 May you have a strong foundation
 When the winds of changes shift
 
 May your heart always be joyful
 May your song always be sung
 And may you stay
 May you stay forever young
 
 Forever young
 Forever young
 May you stay
 May you stay forever young
 
 Green, green, forty shades of green
 
 I close my eyes and picture
 The emerald of the sea
 From the fishing boats at Dingle
 To the shores of Donaghadee
 
 I miss the river Shannon
 And the folks at Skibbereen
 The moorlands and the meddle
 With their forty shades of green
 
 But most of all I miss a girl
 In Tipperary town
 And most of all I miss her lips
 As soft as eiderdown
 
 Again I want to see and do
 The things we've done and seen
 Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
 And there's forty shades of green
 
 Green, green, forty shades of green
 
 I wish that I could spend an hour
 At Dublin's churching surf
 I'd love to watch the farmers
 Drain the bogs and spade the turf
 
 To see again the thatching
 Of the straw the women glean
 I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see
 The forty shades of green
 
 But most of all I miss a girl
 In Tipperary town
 And most of all I miss her lips
 As soft as eiderdown
 
 Again I want to see and do
 The things we've done and seen
 Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar
 And there's forty shades of green
 
 Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
 All those things that don't change, come what may
 But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
 I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
 
 Guess I'll go down to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall
 Got some friends that I can go to workin' for
 Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time
 But we've been through that a hundred times or more
 
 If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good
 You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
 But by then it would be winter, not enough for you to do
 And those winds sure do blow cold way up there
 
 Well now Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
 They were true as a blue blue sky
 He was a long-legged guitar picker with a wicked wanderin' eye
 But he was her man nearly all of the time
 Well Johnny he packed up to leave her but he promised he'd be back
 He said he had a little pickin' to do a little farther down the track
 He said I'm your man I wouldn't do you wrong
 Well Frankie curled up on the sofa thinkin' about her man
 Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band
 He was Frankie's man he wadn't doin' her wrong
 Then in the front door walked a redhead Johnny saw her right away
 She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played
 He was Frankie's man but she was far away
 He sang every song to the redhead she smiled back at him
 Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim
 What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none
 Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him she slapped him a time or two
 She said I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you
 If you're her man you better treat her right
 Well the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick
 Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick
 He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong
 
 The beautiful spacious skies, the amber waves of grain
 To the majestic purple mountains above the fruited plain
 God did shed His grace from sea to shining sea on you and on me
 From Sleepy Hollow mountain country to the swamps of Okefenokee
 
 To Guthrie Oklahoma, to Hibbing Minnesota
 To Grants Pass Oregon, to Stone Pipe Wells, California
 From Texas to Montana, from California to Maine
 
 In the sunny days the winter snow from Arizona sand
 To Cherokee North Carolina, to Tarpen Springs Florida
 America, it's time to be refreshed, recalled to memory
 God did shed His grace on Thee from sea to shining sea
 
 The land is big the best is free
 Sand and surf grass and tree from sea to shining sea
 God shed His grace on me
 And crown Thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea
 
 Hello there my it's been a long time
 How am I doin'? Well, I guess that I'm doin' fine
 It's been so long now but it seems now it was only yesterday
 It ain't it funny how time slips away
 How's your new love I hope that he's doin' fine
 I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
 What if I remember that's the same thing that you told me it was lonely yes
 It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
 
 I gotta go now 
 I guess I'll see you somewhere around
 You don't know, you'll never know, we don't know, you can't know when 
 I'll be back in town
 Maybe tomorrow, please remember
 What I told you, told you, that entire time you're gonna pay
 It ain't funny, funny, funny how time slips away
 
 Oh, what I want you to do is just remember, just remember, what I told you
 And time, time, you're gonna pay
 It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
 
 One day I want you to do
 Just remember, remember, what I told you
 And time, time
 It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slipped away
 
 It's the same thing, same thing, that you told me 
 It seems like just the other day
 It ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away
 
 It's a funny thing about the time
 It's funny baby, how time slips away
 
 Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed
 Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold
 Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold
 I'll meet you further on up the road
 
 Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring
 My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing
 I got a song to sing, keep me out of the cold
 And I'll meet you further on up the road.
 
 Further on up the road
 Further on up the road
 Where the way dark and the night is cold
 One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
 And I'll meet you further on up the road.
 
 Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time
 Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign
 If there's a light up ahead well brother I don't know
 But I got this fever burnin' in my soul
 So let's take the good times as they go
 And I'll meet you further on up the road
 
 Further on up the road 
 
 One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
 And I'll meet you further on up the road
 One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know
 And I'll meet you further on up the road.
 
 If you ever go across the sea to Ireland
 Then maybe at the closing of your day
 You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh
 Or watch the sun go down on Galway Bay
 
 For the breezes blowing o'er the sea to Ireland
 Are perfumed by the heather as they blow
 And the women in the uplands diggin' praties
 Speak a language that the strangers do not know
 
 For the strangers came and tried to teach their way
 And scorned us just for being what we are
 But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams
 Or light a penny candle from a star
 
 And if there is going to be a life hereafter
 And somehow I am sure there's going to be
 I will ask my God to let me make my heaven
 In that dear land across the Irish sea
 
 It's knowin' that your door is always open
 And your path is free to walk
 That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag rolled up
 And stashed behind your couch
 
 And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
 And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
 That keeps you in the back roads
 By the rivers of my memory and keeps you ever gentle on my mind
 
 It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
 Planted on their columns now that bind me
 Or somethin' that somebody said because
 They thought we fit together walkin'
 
 It's just knowin' that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
 When I walk along some railroad track and find
 That you're movin' on the back roads
 By the rivers of my memory and for hours you're just gentle on my mind
 
 Though the wheat fields and the coal mines and the junkyards
 And the highways come between us
 And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
 'Cause she turned and I was gone
 
 I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
 And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
 But not to where I cannot see
 You walkin' on the back roads by the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
 
 I dip my cup of soup
 Back from some gurglin', cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
 My beard a roughenin' coal pile
 And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
 
 Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
 I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
 That you're wavin' from the back roads
 By the rivers of my memory ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind
 
 Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
 C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
 Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones
 Put taps on your toes and get goin'
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues
 
 Little shoeshine boy never get slowed down
 But he's got the dirtiest job in town
 Bendin' low at the peoples' feet
 On the windy corner of a dirty street
 Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
 How'd he keep from gettin' the blues
 He grinned as he raised his little head
 Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.
 
 Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
 C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
 A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
 It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind,
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues.
 
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues
 C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
 Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones
 Put taps on your toes and get goin'
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues.
 
 Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
 And I thought I was gonna jump with joy
 Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
 He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
 He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
 I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way
 He said I like it with a big wide grin
 Kept on a poppin' and he said again
 
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues
 C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues
 It only cost a dime, just a nickel a shoe
 It does a million dollars worth of good for you
 Get rhythm, when you get the blues
 
 Jesus our King, kind and good
 Was humbly born in a stable of wood
 And the lowly beasts around Him stood
 Jesus our King, kind and good
 
 "I", said the donkey, shaggy and brown
 "I carried His mother up and down
 I carried His mother to Bethlehem town"
 "I", said the donkey, shaggy and brown
 
 "I", said the ox, "This was my hay
 I gave Him my manger, 'twas here that He lay
 I gave Him my manger, 'twas here that He lay"
 "I", said the ox, "This was my hay"
 
 "I" said the sheep with pearly horn
 "I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm
 He wore my coat on Christmas morn"
 "I", said the sheep with pearly horn
 
 "I", said the dove, from the rafters high
 "I sang Him to sleep that He would not cry
 We sang Him to sleep, my love and I"
 "I", said the dove, from the rafters high
 
 And so every heart, by some good spell
 In the stable dark, was glad to tell
 Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel
 Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel
 
 The girl from the canyon smiled a smile that brought me home 
 As sick and bleeding as I was she took me on her own 
 Brought me to the canyon where the sun poured down like rain 
 Her smiling eyes and the mountain light I thought myself insane 
 These hills have seen me runnin' till my horse could hardly stand 
 Hidin' by day in the mountains movin' with the moon on the land 
 I'm hoping to find my freedom in a world that wants me dead 
 The girl from the canyon took and healed my wounds instead 
 The girl from the canyon she don't need to know what I had done 
 She laughed with me in the moonlight till the morning brought the sun 
 The girl from the canyon the girl from the canyon she was the only one 
 An outlaw is a hunted one with aprice upon his head 
 We're all outlaws in a way that is what she said 
 And so I left the canyon when I was strong enough to ride 
 The girl from the canyon she was riding by my side 
 The girl from the canyon.. 
 She was the only one
 
 If you're travelin' in the north country fair
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
 Remember me to one who lives there
 Oh she once was a true love of mine
 
 See for me if her hair's hanging down
 It curls and falls all down her breast
 See for me that her hair's hanging down
 That's the way I remember her best
 
 If you go when the snowflakes falls
 When the rivers freeze and summer ends
 Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm
 To keep her from the howlin' winds
 
 If you're travelin' in the north country fair
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
 Please say "hello" to the one who lives there
 Oh she was once a true love of mine
 
 If you're travelin' in the north country fair
 Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
 Remember me to one who lives there
 Oh she once was a true love of mine
 
 A true love of mine
 A true love of mine
 True love of mine
 A true love of mine
 A true love of mine
 She was once a true love of mine
 
 I left a little town
 A little south of Hudson Bay 
 I couldn't find a thing, to make a rounder want to stay
 I fought the wind across the barren waste in the crystal doom
 Going for to marry the girl in Saskatoon
 
 I'm glad I realized that no one could take her place
 My heart was beating for her like the winter beat my face
 But knowing that I'd see her made my spirit bright as June
 I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon
 
 South and West and following the cold December sun
 I bedded down in the Carragana when my daily trek was done
 Then up and pressing onward by the light of the morning moon
 A prodigal returning to the girl in Saskatoon
 
 Then I found the trail that had packed beneath the snow
 I made the final miles where the prairie lilies grow
 The steeple on a church glistened by the prairie moon
 I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon
 
 My journey was forgotten
 When I held her in my arms
 My wanderlust was stifled
 By possession of her charms
 And even beneath the steeple
 Where we couldn't wait till June
 I found eternal spring with the girl in Saskatoon
 
 I found him by the railroad track this morning
 I could see that he was nearly dead
 I knelt down beside him and I listened
 Just to hear the words the dying fellow said
 
 He said they let me out of prison down in Frisco
 For ten long years I've paid for what I've done
 I was trying to get back to Louisiana
 To see my Rose and get to know my son
 
 Give my love to Rose please won't you, Mister
 Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
 Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
 And don't forget to give my love to Rose
 
 Won't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me
 Tell my boy to help his mom at home
 Tell my Rose to try to find another
 'Cause it ain't right that she should live alone
 
 Mister here's a bag with all my money
 It won't last them long the way it goes
 God bless you for finding me this morning
 And don't forget to give my love to Rose
 
 Give my love to Rose please won't you, Mister
 Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothes
 Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
 And don't forget to give my love to Rose
 
 Go on blues go on lonesome get your dark clouds off of me
 Go on blues go on troubles turn loose of me set me free
 I've been down through that valley with you
 Now I've found me somebody who loves me too
 Go on blues go away from me go on by me go on blues
 
 I've been down through
 Yeah go on blues go on by me get away from me go on blues
 
 There's so much I don't know
 There's so much I don't know
 I don't understand why the summer's so hot
 I don't understand why an apple core rots
 And I have no idea when I'll see a rainbow
 But there's one thing I do know
 
 I know that God ain't no stained glass window
 And I believe there is a Holy Ghost
 I know that God ain't no stained glass window
 'Cause He never keeps His window closed
 
 There's so much I don't see
 There's so much I don't see
 I don't see how hair can turn silver-grey
 I don't see why my prayers can't get answered right away
 I don't see why some folks keep a load in their mind
 With a sharp axe to grind
 
 And I don't understand why the truth takes a twist
 I don't understand why there is loneliness
 I don't know why they claim some men have no soul
 But there's one thing I do know
 
 No, He never keeps His window closed
 
 When Robert E Lee surrendered the Confederacy Jefferson Davis was upset about it 
 He said how dare that man resent an order 
 Form the president of the Confederate States of America 
 Then somebody told him that General Lee had made the decision himself 
 In order to save lives because he felt that the battle comin' up 
 Would cost about twenty thousand lives on both sides 
 And he said two hundred and forty thousand dead already is enough 
 So this song is not about the North or the South but about the bloody brother war 
 Brother against brother father against son the war that nobody won 
 And for all those lives that were saved I gotta say Dod bless Robert E Lee 
 Well the mansion where the General used to live is burning down 
 Cotton fields are blue with Sherman's troupes 
 I overheard a Yankee say yesterday Nashville fell 
 So I'm on my way to join the fight General Lee might need my help 
 But look away look away Dixie I don't want them to see 
 What they're doing to my Dixie God bless Robert E Lee 
 Sherman's troupes burned Atlanta and the flames lit up the sky 
 And those of us who survived it are watchin' my Dixie die 
 But today at Appamattox General Lee sat down 
 And surrender to the Yankees and Ulysees S Grant 
 So look away look away Dixie... 
 I won't ever stop loving you my Dixie till they put me in the ground 
 And the last words they probably hear from me are God bless Robert E Lee
 
  
 Oh the world is full of people with money just to burn 
 Affording all the things in life for which a man might yearn 
 Some can take life easy but I live from day by day 
 God has my fortune laid away 
 
 I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain 
 The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame 
 Pockets that stay empty dreams that go astray 
 God has my fortune laid away 
 
  
 Oh how often I have wondered why some things have to be 
 Some people live in riches while some live just like me 
 The more I try to work and save the more I have to pay 
 But God has my fortune laid away  
 I search for sunshine
 
 God will walk with me down streets where no one else will walk 
 God will talk with me of things that no one else will talk 
 When no one else will walk and no one else will talk when no one will God will 
 God will share with me the little worries no one knows are there 
 God will care for me whenever there is no one else to care 
 When no one will be there and no one else will share when no one will God will 
 God will think of me when friends forget and fail to understand 
 God will strengthen me when I am weak and need a helping hand 
 When no one understands or lends a helping hand 
 When no one will God will when no one will God will
 
 You can run on for a long time
 Run on for a long time
 Run on for a long time
 Sooner or later God'll cut you down
 Sooner or later God'll cut you down
 
 Go tell that long tongue liar
 Go and tell that midnight rider
 Tell the rambler,
 The gambler,
 The back biter
 Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
 Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
 
 Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news
 My head's been wet with the midnight dew
 I've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Galilee
 He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
 I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
 He called my name and my heart stood still
 When he said, "John go do My will!"
 
 Go tell that long tongue liar
 Go and tell that midnight rider
 Tell the rambler,
 The gambler,
 The back biter
 Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
 Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
 
 You can run on for a long time
 Run on for a long time
 Run on for a long time
 Sooner or later God'll cut you down
 Sooner or later God'll cut you down
 
 Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand
 Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
 But as sure as God made black and white
 What's down in the dark will be brought to the light
 
 You can run on for a long time
 Run on for a long time
 Run on for a long time
 Sooner or later God'll cut you down
 Sooner or later God'll cut you down
 
 Go tell that long tongue liar
 Go and tell that midnight rider
 Tell the rambler,
 The gambler,
 The back biter
 Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
 Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
 
 Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
 
 You can see it in the movies and the paper and the TV news 
 Somebody's army is always on the move 
 There's gonna be a battle the lines have been drawn 
 They've got guns and tanks and planes 
 
 The wells are gone dry and the water is bad and the air is acid rain 
 There's war after war and rumors of war from the East 
 There's a rumblin' in the ground and they're talkin' about the beast 
 
 Good mothers cry cause the rivers run high 
 With the blood of too many sons 
 Some people say peace is on the way 
 But the worst is still to come 
 
 Cause the prophets wrote about it 
 And Jesus spoke about it 
 And John got to take a look 
 And he told us what he saw when it's easy to see 
 It's goin' by the book 
 It's goin' by the book 
 
 There's armies in the cities and the missiles stand ready for flight 
 A pale horse rides like the wind across the night 
 And that rumblin' in the desert like thunder gettin' closer 
 And the trumpet's gettin' ready to blow 
 There's gonna be a shout that will wake the dead we better be ready to go 
 
 Cause the prophets wrote about it 
 And Jesus spoke about it 
 And John got to take a look 
 And he told us what he saw when it's easy to see 
 It's goin' by the book 
 It's goin' by the book 
 
 It's goin' by the book 
 Goin' by the book
 
 Bring a drink of water Leroy bring a drink of water

 But dues took all my money wouldn't let me see the cards 
 I owen the boss about a hundred years for sleepin' in his backyard 
 I'm goin' to Memphis  yeah I'm goin' to Memphis

 Let the honky tonk roll on come mornin' I'll be gone 
 I'm goin' to Memphis yeah Memphis 
 I never been to Chicago but it must be a mighty fine place  
 
 I couldn't get past Tennessee with Mississippi all over my face  
 I'm goin' to Memphis  
 Well the freezin' ground at night is my own foldin' bed 
 Polk salad is my bread and meat and it will be till I'm dead 
 
 Well I brought me a little water in a Mr Prince Albert can 
 But the bossman caught me drinkin' it and I believe he broke my hand  
 They all call me crazy for sassin' Mr Scott 
 My brother was killed for a deed I did but I disremember what  
 
 Well another boy is down the shovel burned him out 
 Let me stand on his body to see what the shoutin's about 
 I'm goin' to Memphis yeah I'm goin' to Memphis hmm 
 Like a bitter weed
 
 At the end of the day when all had been done 
 And all had been said 
 In the kitchen laughing with you 
 Before I went to bed 
 My face in the light illuminated 
 Untroubled and safe 
 As your face is shining upon me 
 A love that would never cease 
 Out where the cold wind blows 
 It rocks my childhood sleep 
 And up in the starry skies 
 And further out to sea 
 Late in time when it will come 
 I see it in my dreams 
 At night with the cold wind blowing 
 At night with the cold wind blowing outside 
 Gone the dream, it's all faded now 
 Gone the dream, it's all faded now 
 Take me home 
 Hours pass ticking slowly 
 Lying wide awake 
 All across the land the lights are out 
 Under an open sky 
 I feel for you and everybody 
 Dreaming in your beds 
 I'm feeling lost, there is nothing 
 Nothing more than this 
 Going out where the cold wind blows 
 It rocks my childhood sleep 
 And up in the starry skies 
 And further out to sea 
 Late in time when it will come 
 I see it in my dreams 
 At night with the cold wind blowing 
 At night with the cold wind blowing
 
 He's not on some golden throne way off and out of space
 He's not hidin' out in some big secret hidin' place
 I can guarantee he'll be your friend to touch and hold
 And I'm qualified to tell it cause I've got it in control
 
 Good morning friend good morning friend
 Every day's a brand new morning since the morning you will din
 Good morning friend good morning friend
 Yes I'm feeling like a million since I've got you livin' in
 
 He'll stand and knock upon your door do you let him inside
 He'll be a constant comforter and keep you satisfied
 He will make himself avaliable no matter who you are
 He'll light your darkest night and be your bright and morning star
 
 Good morning friend good morning friend
 Yes I'm feeling like a million since the morning you moved in
 Good morning friend good morning friend
 Ask me how I feel this morning and I'm proud to say again
 Good morning friend good morning friend
 Yes I'm feeling like a million since I've got you livin' in

 I used to have a sweetheart but now I've got none
 Since she's gone and left me, I care not for one
 Since she's gone and left me, contended I'll be
 For she loves another one better than me
 
 Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you
 I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you
 And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true
 And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue
 
 I passed my love's window both early and late
 The look that she gave me, made my heart ache
 The look that she gave me was harm for to see
 For she loves another one better than me
 
 Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you
 I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you
 And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true
 And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue
 
 I wrote my love a letter in rosy red lines
 She sent me an answer all twisted and twine
 Saying keep your love letters and I will keep mine
 Write to your sweetheart and I'll write to mine
 
 Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you
 I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you
 And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true
 And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue
 
 The old home town looks the same,
 As I step down from the train,
 And there to meet me is my mama and my papa.
 Down the road I look, and there comes Mary,
 Hair of gold and lips like cherries.
 It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
 
 The old house is still standing,
 Though the paint is cracked and dry,
 And there's the old oak tree that I used to play on.
 Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary,
 Hair of gold and lips like cherries.
 It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
 
 Yes, they'll all come to see me,
 Arms reaching, smiling sweetly.
 It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
 
 Then I awake and look around me,
 To the cold gray walls that surround me,
 And then I realize that I was only dreaming.
 For there's a guard, and there's a sad old padre,
 Arm in arm, I'll walk at daybreak.
 Again, I'll touch the green, green grass of home.
 
 Yes, they'll all come to see me
 In the shade of the old oak tree,
 As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.
 
 Thank you very much
 This next song was written by a man right here in Folsom prison
 And last night was the first time I've ever sung this song
 Anyways, this song was written by our friend Glen Shirley
 Um, hope we do your song justice Glen, we're going to do our best
 
 Inside the walls of prison my body may be
 But my Lord has set my soul free
 There's a greystone chapel here at Folsom
 A house of worship in this den of sin
 You wouldn't think that God had a place here at Folsom
 But he saved the souls of many lost men
 Now there's greystone chapel here at Folsom
 Stands a hundred years old made of granite rock
 It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom
 But the door to the House of God is never locked
 
 Inside the walls of prison my body may be
 But my Lord has set my soul free
 
 There are men here that don't ever worship
 There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray
 But I've got down on my knees in that greystone chapel
 And I thank the Lord for helpin' me each day
 Now there's greystone chapel here at Folsom
 It has a touch of God's hand on ever stone
 It's a flower of light in a field of darkness
 And it's givin' me the strength to carry on
 Inside the walls of prison my body may be
 But my Lord has set my soul free
 
 Have an announcement from Lt. Piper
 Ah, steady
 Uh, Duffy, number nine oh four seven, custody office
 There's a gentleman here I'd like to have stand up, who's a very very proud man
 He used to be many years ago, a bad land farmer down in Dias, Arkansas
 But he's Johnny Cash's daddy, Mr. Ray Cash
 I'd like to bring up a gentleman who's got something to say to Johnny Cash
 This gentleman you all know, the associate warden Mr. Fausman
 Good to see you sir. You want Mr. John Cash, don't ya
 Sorta like to, yes. Johnny

 Like a cuddle up
 We'll make him one of the in group when he's out
 Thank you Mr. Fousman
 One other announcement. Please hold your seats until released by the officer
 And then go out through the side door
 
 Well, you asked me if I'll forget my baby
 I guess I will, someday
 I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
 You asked me if I'll get along
 I guess I will, some way
 I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
 
 God gave me that girl to lean on
 Then He put me on my own
 Heaven, help me be a man and
 Have the strength to stand alone
 I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
 
 You asked me if I'll miss her kisses
 I guess I will, everyday
 I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
 You asked me if I'll find another
 I don't know, I can't say
 I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
 
 God gave me that girl to lean on
 Then He put me on my own
 Heaven, help me be a man and
 Have the strength to stand alone
 I don't like it, but I guess things happen that way
 
 In the desert where we searched for gold the days're hot the nights're cold 
 Hank and Joe and me walked on so bold and brave and free 
 For days and days we fought the heat I got so thirsty and I got so weak 
 And when I fell cause I couldn't go I heard Hank say to Joe 
 He's dyin'  for water hear him cryin'  for water 
 Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said Joe you know he's a dyin' man 
 Leave him there and let him die I can't stand to hear him cry for water 
 I don't remember how long I lay but when I awoke it was the break of day 
 Buzzards circled miles ahead I knew Hank and Joe were dead 
 My eyes were dimmed but I could see a bed of gold nuggets under me 
 Now I know that it won't be long till they decorate my bones 
 Cause I'm dyin'  for water can't help cryin'  for water 
 Well they laid me down in the dust and sand he said Joe you know he's a dyin' man 
 Leave him there and let him die I can't stand to hear him cry for water 
 He couldn't stand to hear me cry for water
 
 Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam
 On the beach I built sand castles too
 My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled
 All of this was meaningless 'cause happiness is you
 
 No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars
 I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are
 My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you
 Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you
 
 I tried to doubt you and live without you
 Tried to deny but I love you like a do
 But I realize now and I'll admit it
 You'll always be a part of me 'cause happiness is you
 
 No more chasing moonbeams
 
 Happy to be with you happy to be with you
 Happy to be with you bound to follow you
 Somewhere someone above sent you to me for me to love
 Hearts can tremble and shake hearts can shutter and break
 I give more than I take cause I'm happy to be with you
 Happy to be with you happy to be with you
 
 Good times outweigh the bad count the good ones we've had
 We have our ups and downs but the good times come around
 Nickels and pennies are few don't have a fortune for you
 Love you yes I do and I'm happy to be with you
 Happy to be with you happy to be with you
 
 Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
 While we all sup sorrow with the poor
 There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.
 
 'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
 Oh hard times, come again no more.
 
 While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
 There are frail forms fainting at the door
 Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.
 
 'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
 Oh hard times, come again no more.
 
 There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
 With a worn heart, whose better days are o'er
 Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.
 
 'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
 Oh hard times, come again no more.
 
 'Tis the song, the sign of the weary
 Hard times, hard times, come again no more
 Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
 Oh hard times, come again no more.
 
 I know a man whose plow handle hand is quicker than a light
 Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night
 For he might have to kill or walk around a fight
 
 And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun
 He won't say how many tried and died
 Up against the top hand up against the wrong man cause Hardin' wouldn't run
 
 He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train
 Goin' goin' with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up
 So long Janie chin up I'll be back again
 
 Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried
 Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died
 And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky
 
 Free at last the payin' past for all the wrong he did
 First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid
 So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid
 
 Near the border in El Paso Lawyer reads the sign
 You won't find him there for business every day at nine
 For business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time
 
 Then sheriff Selman's boy broke in to Wes's woman's place
 Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face
 And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace
 
 You could see every night by candlelight in Hardin's favorite bar
 She'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there
 Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasn't far
 
 Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazin' gun
 Wes Hardin chug-a-luggin' red eye got him in the back of the head
 John Wesley Hardin fell dead cos Hardin wouldn't run
 
 In the long, hot, thirsty summer of about 32 A.D.
 Along a dusty highway, there came a man of Galilee
 And as he went through Samaria, he stopped at Jacob's well
 And there he met a woman whose deep secrets he would tell
 
 "Could I have a drink of water?", Soft and quietly asked he
 And she said, "Sir, I'm Samaritan, how dare you speak to me?"
 He said, "If you would ask of me than either son of man
 Would give you living water and you'd never thirst again'
 
 Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
 Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
 Dip in' to the endless well, pour it on the fires of hell
 Have a drink and sing and shout as the flames of hell go out
 Have a drink of water, everlastin', endless water
 
 Then the woman said, "Sir, you have no way to draw out of this well
 Our father Jacob dug it and the stories it could tell
 From this well drank his children and his kettle by the score
 Where is your well, Sir, tell me, that will flow forever more"
 
 And he answered and said, "Unto her your water will go dry
 And my well is everlastin', if you drink you'll never die'
 My father God's a spirit and he set me under men
 To give you living water so you'll never thirst again
 
 Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
 Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
 Dip in' to the endless well, pour it on the fires of hell
 Have a drink and sing and shout as the flames of hell go out
 Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
 
 Well, there now are many thirstin' in this modern century
 Whose thirst could be quenched quickly by the man from Galilee
 For the water flows eternal from the well that never dries
 For it flows right out of Heaven where the soul never dies
 
 So if you're hot and tired and thirstin'
 And if you crave a cool, tall drink
 He will pour it right out for you a lot quicker than you think
 He already knows you're thirsty so just let him come on in
 And he'll give you livin' water and you'll never thirst again
 
 Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
 Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
 Dip in' to the endless well, pour it on the fires of hell
 Have a drink and sing and shout as the flames of hell go out
 Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water
 
 Have a drink of water, everlastin' livin' water, bro
 Have a drink of water, ever last
 Clap your hands and sing and shout
 
 Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
 Thou art the Potter, I am the clay.
 Mold me and make me after Thy will,
 While I am waiting, yielded and still.
 
 Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
 Search me and try me, Master, today!
 Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
 As in Thy presence humbly I bow.
 
 Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
 Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!
 Power, all power, surely is Thine!
 Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.
 
 Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
 Hold o'er my being absolute sway!
 Fill with Thy Spirit 'till all shall see
 Christ only, always, living in me.
 
 He said "I'll love you till I die",
 She told him "You'll forget in time"
 As the years went slowly by,
 She still preyed upon his mind
 
 He kept her picture on his wall,
 Went half-crazy now and then
 He still loved her through it all,
 Hoping she'd come back again
 
 Kept some letters by his bed
 Dated nineteen sixty-two
 He had underlined in red
 Every single "I love you"
 
 I went to see him just today,
 Oh but I didn't see no tears
 All dressed up to go away, first time
 I'd seen him smile in years
 
 He stopped loving her today
 They placed a wreath upon his door
 And soon they'll carry him away
 He stopped loving her today
 
 You know,
 She came to see him one last time.
 Aww, 'n' we all wondered if she would.
 And it kept runnin' through my mind
 "This time he's over her for good."
 
 He stopped loving her today
 They placed a wreath upon his door
 And soon they'll carry him away
 He stopped loving her today
 
 Thank you very much
 We'd like to hit one serious note for you
 Even if that note is out of tune
 We'd like to hit a serious note, right now
 
 June and I went to the land of Israel in the month of May last year
 With a tape recorder
 We took it with us
 And there are some things in this world
 That everyone wants to see or hear at one time or anther in their life
 And especially for you fellas, I think it's
 We feel real good that we can bring back sounds of the people and the places
 I know a lot of you are just like I was
 They were always dear to you, the stories and the songs about Israel
 We went to Nazareth, Thank you
 We went to Nazareth, and went to the Sea of Galilee to Tiberius
 We went to Jerusalem, the way of the cross, went to the wailing wall
 All these sounds are on the album for you to hear,
 And we hope that you'll enjoy some of it
 I'd like to tell you, a real happening in this album
 We went into the little town of town of Kayna
 Just over the hills from Nazareth
 And there's a church that sits over the sis-turn where the water came from
 That Christ turned to wine where the first miracle was performed
 We went into the church, saw the sis-turns,
 You could hear the sounds of the water in there
 Hear the Echo
 I was so impressed when I came out of the church, if I ever had an inspiration
 And I had one then
 From seeing what I had just seen and heard
 And I said under my breath "He turned the water, into wine of all things"
 On the way to Tiberius, in the car
 In the next few minutes, I wrote this song
 
 He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine
 In the little Canan town the word went all around that
 He turned the water into wine
 
 Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
 He walked upon the Sea of Galilee
 Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and
 Walked upon the Sea of Galilee
 
 He turned the water into wine he did my lord now,
 He turned the water into wine
 In the little Canan town, the word went all around that
 He turned the water into wine
 
 He fed the hungry multitude 
 He fed the hungry multitude.
 With a little bit of fish and bread,
 They said every one was fed, 
 He fed the hungry multitude.
 
 He turned the water into wine.
 
 He turned the water into wine,
 In the little Canan town, the word went all around that
 He turned the water into wine.
 He turned the water into wine
 
 Well, God told Noah to build an ark
 He said it's gonna rain, gonna be dark
 Call in the animals two by two
 And don't let a sinful man go through
 
 So the flood came just like He said
 And every evil thing on earth was dead
 But Noah's faith was like a rock
 God laid his ark on a mountain top
 
 He'll be a friend and guide you
 He'll walk along with you
 You'll feel it there inside you
 He'll help you make it through
 
 When things look dark Noah saw the light
 'Cause faith had told him right was might
 If you need a friend He'll guide you
 He'll be a friend to you
 
 Well, you've heard of Samson, the strong man
 The mightiest man in all the land
 There was one purpose for his might
 He had to deliver the Israelites
 
 By the Philistines he was overcome
 They tied him up to carry him home
 But Samson prayed and his bounds were gone
 He killed a thousand with an old jawbone
 
 He'll be a friend and guide you
 He'll walk along with you
 You'll feel it there inside you
 He'll help you make it through
 
 God showed Samson what to do
 And it's the same God that stands by you
 If you need a friend He'll guide you
 He'll be a friend to you
 
 Give, when you give Him the best of your service
 Tellin' the world that the savior has come
 Be not dismayed if man don't believe you
 He'll understand and say, "Well done"
 
 Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
 Weary of life and the battle is won
 Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
 He'll understand and say, "Well done"
 He'll understand and say, "Well done"
 
 Misunderstood the savior of sinners
 Died on the cross, He was God's only Son
 But He knew well that his Father in Heaven
 Would understand and say, "Well done"
 
 Oh, when I come to the end of my journey
 Weary of life and the battle is won
 Bearing the staff and the cross of redemption
 He'll understand and say, "Well done"
 
 I want to live,
 I want to give
 I've been a miner
 for a heart of gold.
 It's these expressions
 I never give
 That keeps me searching
 for a heart of gold
 And I'm getting old.
 Keeps me searching
 for a heart of gold
 And I'm getting old.
 
 I've been to Hollywood
 I've been to Redwood
 I crossed the ocean
 for a heart of gold
 I've been in my mind,
 it's such a fine line
 That keeps me searching
 for a heart of gold
 And I'm getting old.
 Keeps me searching
 for a heart of gold
 And I'm getting old.
 
 Keep me searching
 for a heart of gold
 You keep me searching
 for a heart of gold
 And I'm getting old.
 I've been a miner
 for a heart of gold. 
 
 Some days I think this old machine is out to get me
 Some days she does what I tell her
 It's like dancing with the widow-maker forty hours a week
 I'm talkin' 'bout a big old D10 Caterpillar
 
 I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do
 It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
 Could be the money babe, could be the power
 Could be I love the way it feels
 Could be I love the way it feels
 
 But you know she's mighty unforgivin' and you got to pay attention
 'Cause the d-10 can be the death of you
 But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul
 And it's hard to tell just who's drivin' who
 
 I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut
 I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru
 I can push the rocky mountains into the sea
 You know heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me
 
 I'm like a modern day mule skinner, drivin' ten thousand mules
 So say a little prayer every day
 Lord, just let me get her turned around without fallin' off this mountain
 You know the boss man don't like us treatin' his D10 that way
 
 I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do
 It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel
 Could be the money babe, could be the power
 Could be I love the way it feels
 Could be I love the way it feels
 
 Could be I love the way it feels
 Could be I love the way it feels
 
 Lord, Help me walk
 Another mile, just one more mile,
 I'm tired of walkin' all alone.
 
 Lord, Help me smile
 Another smile, just one more smile,
 I know I just can't make it on my own.
 
 I never thought I needed help before,
 I thought that I could do things by myself.
 Now I know I just can't take it any more.
 With a humble heart, on bended knee,
 I'm beggin' You, please, Help Me.
 
 Come down from Your golden
 Throne to me, to lowly me,
 I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand.
 
 Remove the chains of darkness
 And let me see, Lord let me see,
 Just where I fit into your master plan.
 
 I never thought I needed help before,
 I thought that I could do things by myself.
 Now I know I just can't take it any more.
 With a humble heart, on bended knee,
 I'm beggin' You, please, Help Me.
 
 Take the ribbon from your hair
 Shake it loose and let it fall
 Layin' soft against your skin
 Like the shadows on the wall
 
 Come and lay down by my side
 Till the early mornin' light
 All I'm askin' is your time
 Help me make it through the night
 
 I don't care who's right or wrong
 I don't try to understand
 I don't care about tomorrow
 'Cause tonight I need a friend
 
 Yesterday is dead and gone
 And tomorrow's out of sight
 Ain't it sad to be alone
 Help me make it through the night
 
 I don't care who's right or wrong
 I don't try to understand
 I don't care about tomorrow
 June tonight I need a friend
 
 Yesterday is dead and gone
 And tomorrow's out of sight
 Ain't it sad to be alone
 Help me make it through the night
 Ain't it sad to be alone
 Help me make it through the night
 
  
 Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant woman 
 He grew up in another small village 
 Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter 
 
 Then for three years he was a traveling minister 
 But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born 
 And where he did go he usually walked 
 He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home 
 
 Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big city 
 Yes here was a man 
 Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness 
 He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world 
 
 Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world 
 While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him 
 Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him 
 One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies 
 
 Then he went through the mockery of a trial 
 And was nailed to a cross between two thieves 
 And even while he was dying his executioners gambled 
 For the only piece of property that he had in this world 
 
 And that was his robe his purple robe 
 When he was dead he was taken down from the cross 
 And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends 
 More than nineteen centuries have come and gone 
 
 And today he's a centerpiece of the human race 
 Our leader in the column to human destiny 
 I think I'm well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever marched 
 All of the navies that ever sailed the seas 
 
 All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever reigned 
 All of them put together have not affected the life of man on this earth 
 So powerfully as that one solitary life 
 Here was a man 
 
 Heroes, larger than life
 Up on the screen, every night
 On the late show, oh what a great show
 
 Heroes, under the gun
 Fighting for justice, for everyone
 And we follow, where ever they go
 
 Heroes, standing up tall
 Taking their chances, risking it all
 So you know there'll always be heroes
 
 Heroes, so good to know
 So hard to find, sad when they go
 Like the shadows, on the high road
 
 Heroes, ever on track
 Never give up, never look back
 Never lay low, oh never grow old
 
 Heroes, right from the start
 They fall in love, straight from the heart
 So you know they'll always be heroes
 
 Ride on safe from all danger
 Where have you been for so long
 I've been waiting for another star
 To rise in my night again
 Give me a reason we all must carry on
 Like all the heroes have done
 
 Heroes, facing the fight
 Calling for courage, trying to do right
 When the dust blows, and the light goes
 
 Heroes, tried and true
 One for the other, ready to do
 It tomorrow, like it was the last show
 
 Heroes, put to the test
 Keeping a promise, doing their best
 So you know, there'll always be heroes
 
 Ride on, ride on . . .
 
 Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'
 How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
 Hey, hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe
 We could find us a brand new recipe?
 
 I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill
 And I know a spot right over the hill

 If you wanna have fun come along with me
 
 Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'
 How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?

 Hey, Porter
 Hey Porter
 Would you tell me the time?
 How much longer will it be 
 'Til we cross that Mason Dixon Line?
 At daylight would you tell that engineer to slow it down
 Or better still, just stop the train 
 'Cause I want to look around
 
 Hey, Porter
 Hey, Porter 
 What time did you say?
 How much longer will it be 
 'Til I can see the light of day?
 When we hit Dixie will you tell that engineer to ring his bell
 And ask everybody that ain't asleep to stand right up and yell
 
 Hey, Porter
 Hey, Porter
 It's getting light outside
 This old train is puffin' smoke and I have to strain my eyes
 But ask that engineer if he will blow his whistle please
 'Cause I smell frost on cotton leaves
 And I feel that Southern breeze
 
 Hey, Porter
 Hey, Porter
 Please get my bags for me
 I need nobody to tell me now that we're in Tennessee
 Go tell that engineer to make that lonesome whistle scream
 We're not so far from home so take it easy on the steam
 
 Hey, Porter 
 Hey, Porter
 Please open up the door
 When they stop this train I'm gonna get off first 
 'Cause I can't wait no more
 Tell that engineer I say, 
 Thanks a lot and I didn't mind the fare
 I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil 
 And breathe that Southern air
 
 On the shores of gitchgoomy by the shining big sea water
 Hiawatha old and grayin' listened to the older prophet listened to Lagu
 And the young men and the women from the land of Ojibways
 From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies
 
 Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha
 "I have seen" he said, "A water bigger than the big sea water
 Broader than the gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it
 Salty so that none would use it"
 
 Hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting
 And he spoke to all the people
 It's true what Lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision
 I have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning
 
 And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions
 Bigger than a grove of pine trees, taller than the tallest tree tops
 And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly
 And it carried many people, strange and foreign were these people
 
 And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered
 Then said Hiawatha, "I beheld a darker vision"
 Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies
 In our woodlands rang their axes, in our valleys smoked their cities
 
 Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils
 Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful
 
 And the man with bearded faces, the men with skin so fair
 With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people
 Farther westward, westward, westward then wild wild and wilder
 Grew the west that once was ours
 
 Put on your high heel sneakers 
 Put your wig hat on your head 
 Put on your high heel sneakers
 Put your wig hat on your head 
 Because we're going out tonight, baby 
 Oh, oh, I'm pretty sure you're going to knock them dead 
 
 Put on your red dress, baby
 Because we're going out tonight, come on now! 
 Put on your red dress, baby
 We're going to go out tonight 
 And I'm going to sharpen up my razor 
 Because some cats might want to fight 
 
 Put on your high heel sneakers
 Put your wig hat on your head 
 Put on your high heel sneakers
 Put your wig hat on your head 
 Because we're going out tonight, baby
 Oh, oh, I'm pretty sure you're going to knock them dead 
 
 Put on your red dress, baby
 Because we're going out tonight, yeah, come on now! 
 Put on your red dress, baby
 We're going to go out tonight 
 And I'm going to sharpen up my razor 
 Because some cats might want to fight
 
 My name is Joe Roberts I work for the State 
 I'm a sergeant out on Perenville, barracks No. 8 
 I've always done an honest job, honest as I could 
 Got a brother named Frankie, Frankie ain't no good 
 
 Well, ever since we were young kids it's been the same come down 
 I'd get a call on a short way Frankie's in trouble downtown 
 But if it was any other man I'd put him straight away 
 But sometimes when it's your brother you look the other way 
 
 Yeah me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin' nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
 Takin' turns dancin' with Maria 
 While the band played 'The Night Of The Johnstown Flood'
 
 I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother should 
 Man turns his back on his family he ain't no good 
 
 Well Frankie went into the army back in 1965 
 I got a farm deferment settled down took Maria for my wife 
 But them wheat prices kept on droppin' till it was like we's gettin' robbed 
 Frankie came home in '68 and me I took this job 
 
 Yeah me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin' nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
 Takin' turns dancin' with Maria 
 While the band played 'The Night Of The Johnstown Flood'
 
 I catch him when he's strayin' teach him how to walk that line 
 Man turns his back on his family ain't no friend of mine 
 
 The night was like any other I got a call 'bout the quarter of nine 
 There was trouble at a roadhouse out on the Michigan line 
 There was a kid on the floor lookin' bad bleedin' hard from his head 
 There was a girl cryin' at a table it was Frankie she said 
 
 I ran out and I jumped in my car then I hit the lights 
 I must have done about a hundred and ten to Michigan County that night 
 It was down by the crossroads out by willow bank 
 Seen the Buick with Ohio plates behind the wheel was Frank 
 
 Well I chased him through them county roads 
 Till the sign said Canadian border five miles from here 
 Pulled over to the south out the highway watched his taillights disappeared 
 
 Yeah me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin' nothin' feels better than blood on blood 
 Takin' turns dancin' with Maria 
 While the band played 'The Night Of The Johnstown Flood' 
 
 I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother should 
 Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no good
 
 I woke up this afternoon and looked into your eyes
 And somethin' was as wrong as if the sun forgot to rise
 I picked up a road map and I checked a few good places that I know
 And if you're no longer givin', I believe I'll hit the road and go
 
 I just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out
 'Cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about
 And a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low
 So since I've gotta button up, I believe I'll hit the road and go
 
 County road 6-40, State Highway 45
 Life out of the interstate is very much alive
 There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below
 And my song ain't through playin' yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go
 
 Good morning to you sunshine, good morning to you rain
 The windshield wiper's rhythm keeps me singin' down the pain
 Today I'm gonna miss you less if I miss you at all
 You'll never know, you'll never know
 This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go
 This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go
 
 Just around the corner there's heartache
 Down the street that losers use
 If you can wade in through the teardrops
 You'll find me at the Home of the Blues
 
 I walk and cry while my heartbeat
 Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
 The sun never shines through this window of mine
 It's dark at the Home of the Blues
 
 Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest mem'ries
 Memories so sweet that I cry
 Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
 I just want to give up and lay down and die
 
 So if you've just lost your sweetheart
 And it seems there's no good way to choose
 Come along with me, misery loves company
 You're welcome at the Home of the Blues
 
 Just around the corner there's heartache
 Down the street that losers use
 If you can wade in through the teardrops
 You'll find me at the Home of the Blues
 Yeah, you're gonna find me at the Home of the Blues
 
 Don't be fool by big blue eyes by a smile or a golden curl 
 Cause she'll love you now and then break every vow cause she's just a honky tonk girl 
 Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun 
 She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one 
 She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl 
 Cause she's just a honky tonk girl 
 
 She can never change your ways though you'll give her all the world 
 She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new 
 Cause she's just a honky tonk girl 
 Breaking hearts to her
 
 I hurt myself today
 To see if I still feel
 I focus on the pain
 The only thing that's real
 
 The needle tears a hole
 The old familiar sting
 Try to kill it all away
 But I remember everything
 
 What have I become
 My sweetest friend
 Everyone I know
 Goes away in the end
 
 And you could have it all
 My empire of dirt
 I will let you down
 I will make you hurt
 
 I wear this crown of thorns
 Upon my liars chair
 Full of broken thoughts
 I cannot repair
 
 Beneath the stains of time
 The feelings disappear
 You are someone else
 I am still right here
 
 What have I become
 My sweetest friend
 Everyone I know
 Goes away in the end
 
 And you could have it all
 My empire of dirt
 I will let you down
 I will make you hurt
 
 If I could start again
 A million miles away
 I will keep myself
 I would find a way
 
 I am a pilgrim and a stranger
 Traveling through this wearisome land
 I've got a home in that yonder city, good lord
 And it's not, not made by hand
 
 I've got a mother, sister and a brother
 Who have gone this way before
 I am determined to go and see them, good lord
 For they're on that other shore
 
 I'm goin' down to the river of Jordan
 Just to bathe my wearisome soul
 If I can just touch the hem of his garment, good lord
 Then I know he'd take me home
 
 I am a pilgrim and a stranger
 Traveling through this wearisome land
 I've got a home in that yonder city, good lord
 And it's not, not made by hand
 
 Well the blue's still in the water and the blue's still in the sky 
 And way beyond the blue there's someone watchin' from on high 
 My clothes may be ragged and my shoes may be worn 
 But I've been a wealthy boy since I've been born 
 Cause I call him when I'm troubled and I call him when I'm weak 
 And he always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe 
 He'll be there  he'll be there  
 Like he always is to answer when I call him 
 
 My mother used to tell me I should take it slow 
 The pace is not what matters it's the direction that you go 
 Keep your feet upon the path and your eyes upon the goal 
 You'll have all the joy a heart could ever hold 
 Cause I call him when I'm troubled... 
 Like he always is to answer when I call him
 
 I couldn't manage the problem I laid on myself
 And it just made it worse when I laid them on somebody else
 So I finally surrendered it all, brought down in despair
 I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there
 
 And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
 I came to believe that I needed help to get by
 In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try
 And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
 
 Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own
 And each time I failed it made me feel twice as alone
 Then I cried "Lord there must be a surer and easier way
 For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope everyday"
 
 And I came to believe in a power much higher than I
 I came to believe that I needed help to get by
 In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try
 Then I came to believe in a power much higher than I
 
 
 Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet
 I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
 Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
 I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
 
 A picture from the past came slowly stealing
 As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
 Then suddenly, I got that old time feeling
 I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
 
 It's hard to know, another's lips will kiss you
 And hold you just the way I used to do
 Oh, Heaven only knows how much I miss you
 
 Oh death, where is thy sting?
 Oh grave, where is thy victory?
 Oh life, you are a shining path
 And hope springs eternal just over the rise
 When I see my Redeemer beckoning me
 
 Oh roll my ship over the waves of Your sea
 Let me find a safe port now and then
 Don't let the Dark One in Your sanctuary
 Until it's time to pack it in
 
 Oh roll my ship with the fire of Your breath
 And don't lay a broadside on Your ship as yet
 Blow Ye warm winds when it's chilly and wet
 And don't come too soon for collecting my debt
 
 Oh death, where is thy sting?
 Oh grave, where is thy victory?
 Oh life, you are a shining path
 And hope springs eternal just over the rise
 When I see my Redeemer beckoning me
 
 Oh let me sail on with my ships to the East
 And keep my eye on the North Star
 When the journey is no good for men or for beast
 I'll be safe wherever You are
 
 Just let me sail into Your harbor of lights
 And there and forever to cast out my line
 Give me my task and let me do it right
 And do it with all of my might
 
 Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
 Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you
 
 Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
 In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you
 
 All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
 And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you
 
 Maybe you've been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
 Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you
 
 I saw you walking by his side heard you whisper all those lies 
 And I couldn't keep from crying 
 You sang him love songs tenderly that should have been for you and me 
 And I couldn't keep from crying 
 I saw his eyes drinking your charms while he held you in his arms 
 Him with all his wedding ways rules your heart now in my place 
 I stood and watched him steal a kiss from two lips I know I'll miss 
 And I couldn't keep from crying 
 
 I saw his eyes drinking your charms...
 
 I do believe that I won't make it through the night
 If you don't come on back to me and love me now
 There ain't no way that I can say that it's all right
 I do believe that you're not thinking anyhow
 
 But I believe if you'll remember how it was a little while
 If you'll recall that what we had was hard to beat
 And I believe that if you'll meet me half way down that second mile
 We will trade in all the bitter for the sweet
 
 I do believe that you're not happy without me
 I think you feel the way I'm feeling without you
 Come on and give in to that feeling one more time
 I do believe you won't regret it if you do
 
 But I believe if you'll remember
 
 "Some of the songs I heard by other people, great artists and smaller artists, known writers and unknown writers, back in my formative years, musical and career wise, like back in 1955 and 56. Though I never recorded those songs, and never sang them in public, I've been singing those songs for many many years.  Like a friend of mine named Glen Tubb wrote a song at my house in 1956 that I always remembered."
 
 I don't believe you wanted to leave me
 You cried too much when you went away
 I know deep down inside that you still loved me
 But you listened to those lying tongues and things they had to say
 
 Of course they said I was to blame
 True or not, you felt ashamed
 And they called you a fool each time you listened to my alibis
 
 But I don't believe you wanted to leave me
 You cried too much when we said goodbye
 
 There's gotta be a way to win
 Your love back once again
 Cause it just ain't right
 To let a love like we had fade and die
 
 And I don't believe you wanted to leave me
 You cried too much when we said goodbye
 
 I don't hurt anymore
 
 All my teardrops're dried
 No more walking the floor
 With that burning inside.
 
 Just to think it could be
 Time has opened the door
 And at last I am free
 I don't hurt anymore.
 
 No use to deny I wanted to die
 The day you said we were through
 But now that I find you're out of my mind
 I can't believe that it's true.
 
 I've forgotten somehow
 That I cared so before
 And it's wonderful now
 I don't hurt anymore.
 
 No use to deny I wanted to die
 The day you said we were through
 But now that I find you're out of my mind
 I can't believe that it's true.
 
 I've forgotten somehow
 That I cared so before
 And it's wonderful now 
 I don't hurt anymore.
 
 I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound,
 whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day,
 and I don't know where I'm bound.
 
 Can't stand locks, bars, doors,
 mean cops, insanity, and wars;
 gotta find a place of peace,
 until then, my traveling won't cease,
 but I don't know where I'm bound.
 
 There's gotta be a place for me,
 under some green growing tree;
 with clear cool water running by,
 an unfettered view of the sky,
 but I don't know where I'm bound.
 
 When I die, don't bury me,
 cause then I must be free;
 cremate my body with a grin,
 throw my ashes to the wind,
 cause I don't know where I'm bound.
 
 I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound,
 whistles calling me away, leaving at the break of day,
 and I don't know where I'm bound.
 
 Got myself a little gal,
 she has been a downright pal;
 that old highway's calling me,
 and free I gotta be,
 but I don't know where I'm bound, I don't know where I'm bound.
 
 I don't know where I'm bound.
 
 She gave me my walking papers
 And ran off with someone new
 'Cause he bought her things
 My wages couldn't buy
 So I turned to ups and downers
 And everything between
 Still I can't get her good lovin'
 Off my mind
 
 Well today I bought a Cadillac
 The kind she's always wanted
 I called and asked her
 If she'd like to ride
 She said this is our last date
 I said that's alright with me
 'Cause tonight I'm driving her
 Out of my mind
 
 Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise
 Right off of Lookout Mountain
 Cause she said I never took her out
 When she was mine
 She'll see all seven states
 As we drive to the pearly gates
 Tonight when I drive her
 Out of my mind
 
 All the papers will read "Lovers leap
 Again off Lookout Mountain"
 'Cause I wrote a note
 That called it suicide
 But my epitaph will say
 "He killed his pain yesterday
 When he finally drove that woman
 Off his mind"
 
 Well now here she comes to greet me
 Dressed to kill and so am I
 Hope she asks me if this
 Cadillac will fly
 And I know that I'll die laughin'
 When I show her that it will
 When I drive that woman
 Right out of my mind
 
 Hell I'll take her on a scenic cruise
 Right off of Lookout Mountain
 'Cause she said I never took her out
 When she was mine
 She'll see all seven states
 As we drive to the pearly gates
 Tonight when I drive her
 Out of my mind
 
 They'll say Johnny Cash was quite a smash
 Down here in Chattanooga
 Last night when he drove her
 Out of his mind
 
 Yeah that Cadillac dealer's in for a big surprise too
 99 dollars down, 99 dollars a month
 Yeah it's gonna be just gorgeous
 
 Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else baby when I'm out with you 
 Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else when you kiss me like you do 
 Well am as wild as a buck every time you cause me up 
 You sure make me feel like a wheel 
 Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else that's exactly how I feel 
 
 Oh I feel better all over more than anywhere else 
 When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear 
 Oh I feel better all over more than anywhere else honey anytime that you're near 
 Well my heart beats double time when you hold your hand in mine 
 You sure is a wonderful deal 
 Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else that's exactly how I feel 
 Oh that's exactly how I feel
 
 You think you know the smile on her lips the thrill at the touch of her fingertips 
 But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her 
 
 You think you'll find a heaven of bliss in each caress and each tender kiss 
 But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her 
 
 You stole her love from me one day you didn't care how you've hurt me 
 But you can never steal away mem'ries of what used to be 
 
 You think she's yours to have and to hold 
 But someday you'll learn when her love grows cold 
 
 That I forgot more than you'll ever know about her 
 You stole her love from me
 
 I forgot to remember to forget her
 I can't seem to get her off my mind
 I thought I'd never miss her but I found out somehow
 I think about her almost all the time
 
 The day she went away I made myself a promise
 That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
 But something sure is wrong cause I'm so blue and lonely
 I forgot to remember to forget her
 
 The day she went away

 On a Monday, I was arrested 
 On a Tuesday, they locked me in the jail 
 On a Wednesday, my trial was attested
 On a Thursday, they said guilty and the Judge's gavel fell
 
 I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
 I got chains, chains around my feet
 I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
 And them chains, them chains,
 They're about to drag me down
 
 On a Monday, my momma come to see me
 On a Tuesday, they caught me with a file
 On a Wednesday, I'm down in solitary
 On a Thursday, I start on bread and water for a while
 
 I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
 I got chains, chains around my feet
 I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
 And them chains, them chains,
 They're about to drag me down
 
 I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
 I got chains, chains around my feet
 I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
 And them chains, them chains,
 They're about to drag me down
 
 Hey, this microphone's got a screw loose here
 Somebody come screw this microphone?
 What I say?
 Just a minute, lemme fix this son of alright
 
 I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
 And when they play them cheatin' tunes, I never sing along
 I never ever sing the blues I've forgotten, born to lose
 And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
 
 I hardly ever walk the floor and cry
 And I don't think I've ever said I feel like I could die
 I don't ever lay awake, I never think my heart will break
 I hardly ever walk the floor and cry
 
 I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
 I can't put much feeling in saying love is all gone wrong
 I don't lose no sleep at night 'cause things with you are going right
 And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs
 
 I never call your name out in my sleep
 You never make me worry and you never make me weep
 I never wonder if you're true, I spend a night curled up with you
 And I never call your name out in my sleep
 
 I hardly ever sing beer
 
 Our little girl had taken sick one evening
 As she walked home from school
 And then her deathbed soon claimed her
 It made us so sad and so blue
 Then she called me close to her bedside
 And whispered these words soft and low
 Tell mommy to come to me quickly
 I want to kiss you both and go
 I hear a sweet voice calling
 Way up in Heaven on high
 God has made room for your daughter
 Oh mommy and daddy don't cry
 Take care of little brother
 Tell him I'm gone to rest
 I know his little heart is broken
 He's all that you have left 
 Then she closed eyes forever
 Never to see us no more
 Until we meet our darlin'
 On that bright and peaceful shore
 I hear a sweet voice calling
 Way up in Heaven on high
 I hear a sweet voice calling
 Way up in Heaven on high
 
 I heard the bells on Christmas Day
 Their old familiar carols play 
 And wild and sweet the words repeat
 Of peace on earth goodwill to men.
 
 I thought how as the day had come
 The belfries of all Christendom 
 Had rolled along unbroken song
 Of peace on earth goodwill to men.
 
 And in despair I bowed my head
 There is no peace on earth I said 
 For hate is strong that mocks the song
 Of peace on earth goodwill to men. 
 
 Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
 God is not dead, nor doubt he sleeps 
 The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
 With peace on earth goodwill to men.
 
 'Til ringin' singin' on its way
 The world revolve from night to day 
 A voice, a chime, a chance so blind,
 On earth goodwill to men.
 
 Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
 God is not dead nor doubt he sleeps 
 The wrong shall fail, the right prevail
 With peace on earth goodwill to men.
 
 Early one morning
 With time to kill
 I borrowed Jebb's rifle
 And sat on a hill
 I saw a lone rider
 Crossing the plain
 I drew a bead on him
 To practice my aim
 
 My brother's rifle
 Went off in my hand
 A shot rang out
 Across the land
 The horse, he kept running
 The rider was dead
 I hung my head
 I hung my head
 
 I set off running
 To wake from the dream
 My brother's rifle
 Went into the sheen
 I kept on running
 Into the south lands
 That's where they found me
 My head in my hands
 
 The sheriff he asked me
 Why had I run
 And then it come to me
 Just what I had done
 And all for no reason
 Just one piece of lead
 I hung my head
 I hung my head
 
 Here in the court house
 The whole town was there
 I see the judge
 High up in the chair
 Explain to the court room
 What went through your mind
 And we'll ask the jury
 What verdict they find
 
 I felt the power
 Of death over life
 I orphaned his children
 I widowed his wife
 I begged their forgiveness
 I wish I was dead
 I hung my head
 I hung my head
 I hung my head
 I hung my head
 
 Early one morning
 With time to kill
 I see the gallows
 Up on a hill
 And out in the distance
 A trick of the brain
 I see a lone rider
 Crossing the plain
 
 And he'd come to fetch me
 To see what they'd done
 And we'll ride together
 To kingdom come
 I prayed for God's mercy
 'Cause soon I'd be dead
 I hung my head
 I hung my head
 
 I hung my head
 I hung my head
 
 I need Jesus to guide me every day
 As I'm travellin' along this rough and narrow way
 Though afflictions fill my soul
 I'm determined to make the goal
 I've gotta have Jesus 'cause I just can't make it by myself
 
 Every day I pray  pray 
 Pray  pray 
 I pray  pray (pray
 Pray pray pray
 Pray and ask the Lord Jesus
 Don't leave me by myself
 
 Every mornin' through the years I pray
 You know I've got to have Jesus
 I just can't it by myself
 By myself
 
 I just don't like this kind of livin' I'm tired of doin' all the givin'
 I give my all and sit and yearn and get no lovin' in return
 And I just don't like this kind of livin'
 
 Why do we stay together if we always fuss and fight
 You ain't never done to be wrong and I ain't never been right
 Tell me where you think we're goin' cause I ain't got no way of knowin'
 When things go wrong you go your way you leave me here to pay and pay
 And I just don't like this kind of livin'
 
 I just don't like the things you're doin' your evil heart will be your ruin
 When things start runnin' smooth and free you haul right off and you pick on me
 And I just don't like this way of livin'
 
 They say the road of love is long it's rocky and it's rough
 But if this road don't start to get smooth I've traveled it long enough
 Why don't you act a little older and get that chip off of your shoulder
 I told you once now I'll tell you twice you better start to treat me nice
 Cause I just don't like this kind of livin'
 
 I just thought you'd like to know
 Since you'd made your plans to go
 It's gonna hurt me so to see you go
 
 But I hope you find another love
 And he'll be good to you
 But still and yet I can't forget
 The things we used to do
 
 I just thought I'd tell you this
 I love you since that first sweet kiss
 It's gonna hurt to miss
 Your tender kiss
 
 But I hope you get to do the
 Things you say you wanna do
 But still and yet I can't forget
 The happiness we knew
 
 I just thought you'd like to know
 How much you've hurt my pride
 I just thought you'd like to know
 How much my heart has cried over you
 
 But, darling, you could never see
 The misery you caused for me
 So I will tell you so cause I just
 Thought that you'd like to know
 
 I love little baby ducks, old pickup trucks
 Slow-movin' trains and rain
 I love little country streams, sleep without dreams
 Sunday school in May and hay
 And I love you, too
 
 I love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends
 Birds of the world and squirrels
 I love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups
 Bourbon in a glass and grass
 And I love you, too
 
 I love honest, open smiles, kisses from a child
 Tomatoes on the vine and onions
 I love winners when they cry, losers when they cry
 Music when it's good and life
 And I love you, too.
 
 I love you because you understand dear
 Every single thing I try to do.
 You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear.
 I love you most of all because you're you.
 
 No matter what the world may say about me,
 I know your love will always see me through.
 I love you for the way you never doubt me.
 But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.
 
 No matter what may be the style or season,
 I know your heart will always be true.
 I love you for a hundred thousand reasons,
 But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.
 
 I love you because you understand dear

 i love you love you

 just in case you care you know i do
 
 i've done everything i know to do
 to catch your eye and get a rise from you
 i've said everything i know to say
 till i'm afraid that i'll scare you away
 i've tried everything i know to try
 and if you won't love me i'm gonna die
 i'll be anything i need to be
 to make you want to bring your love to me

 just in case you care you know i do
 
 You shine your light so I could see that life was more than a chore
 When I came up against the wall you said I am the door
 You gave me reason to believe in you now I believe it even more
 I've never met a man like you before
 You gave me back my pride so I could wear it for all the world to see
 You told me if yesterdays were paid for tomorrow is free
 From now until I die I know I won't be lonely anymore
 I've never met a man like you before
 And if all of my dreams turn to dust before my eyes
 And all of my songs remain unsung
 If all the world can offer me just emptiness and lies
 I know I'll still have your perfect love
 
 Stormy weather comes and goes some of my old friends got washed away
 But you're an Island of refuge on our solid rock I found my place
 If wordly riches failed me but I have you how can I be poor
 I've never met a man like you before
 
 I never picked cotton
 But my mother did
 And my brother did
 And my sister did
 And my daddy died young
 Workin' in a coal mine
 
 When I was just a baby
 Too little for the cotton sack
 I played in the dirt
 While the others worked
 'Til they couldn't straighten up their backs
 And I made myself a promise
 When I was old enough to run
 That I'd never stay a single day
 In that Oklahoma sun
 
 And I never picked cotton
 Like my mother did
 And my brother did
 And my sister did
 And my daddy died young
 Workin' in a coal mine
 
 Folks said that I grew up early
 And the farm couldn't hold me then 
 So I stole ten bucks and a pickup truck
 And I never went back again
 And it was fast cars and whiskey
 Long legged girls and fun
 I had everything that money could bring
 And I took it all with a gun
 
 And I never picked cotton
 Like my mother did
 And my brother did
 And my sister did
 And my daddy died young
 Workin' in a coal mine
 
 It was Saturday night in Memphis
 When a redneck grabbed my shirt
 And he said go back to your cotton sack
 I left him lying in the dirt
 And they'll take me in the morning
 To the gallows just outside
 And in the time I got
 There ain't a hell of a lot
 I can look back on with pride
 
 But I never picked cotton
 Like my mother did
 And my brother did
 And my sister did
 And my daddy died young
 Workin' in a coal mine
 
 I never picked cotton
 Like my mother did
 And my brother did
 And my sister did
 And my daddy died young
 Workin' in a coal mine
 
 I promised you the day you marry me
 I'll be everything to you that I should be
 And while you're in the springtime of your years
 You'll not know what it's like to shed a tear
 I'll be the same through all that we go through
 I promise you I promise you
 
 I promise you for richer or for poorer
 I'll more than share each pain that you endure
 And when you're in the autumn of your years
 You'll call me in the night and I'll be near
 I love you and I'll let you know I do
 I promise you I promise you
 
 I promise you for better or for worse
 I'll stand by you as I did at the first
 And when you're in the winter of your years
 I'll be right by your side to dry your tears
 Yes I'll be the same through all that we go through
 I promise you I promise you
 I promise you I promise you
 
 I ride an old paint, I lead an old Dan
 I'm off to Montan' for to throw the hooley ann
 They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw
 Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw
 
 Ride around little dogies, ride around slow
 The fiery and snuffy are raring to go
 
 Well John's had two daughters and the song
 One went to Denver the other went wrong
 His young wife died in a poolroom fight
 But he tries to keep singing from morning till night
 
 Ride around little dogies, ride around slow
 The fiery and snuffy are raring to go
 
 When I die take my saddle from the wall
 Strap it my pony, lead him out of the stall
 Throw my bones on his back, turn our faces to the west
 And we'll ride the prairie that we love the best
 
 Ride around little dogies, ride around slow
 The fiery and snuffy are raring to go
 
 Last night I dreamed
 An angel came
 He took my hand
 He called my name
 He bid me look
 The other way
 I saw a man
 I heard him say
 
 He said if I be lifted up
 I'll draw all men to me
 He turned and then
 I saw the nail-scarred hand
 That bled for me
 I touched the hem of his garment
 That fell round him there
 My life, my heart, I gave
 My soul was in his care
 
 When I awoke
 My heart beat so
 And in the dark
 I saw a glow
 This was no dream
 He turned my way
 Again I heard
 My saviour say
 
 He said if I be lifted up
 I'll draw all men to me
 He turned and then
 I saw the nail-scarred hand
 That bled for me
 I touched the hem of his garment
 That fell 'round him there
 My life, my heart, I gave
 My soul was in his care
 
 I saw the light, I saw the light
 No more darkness, no more night
 Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light
 
 I walked in darkness, and clouds covered me
 I had no idea where the way out could be
 Then came the sunrise, and drove back the night
 Praise the Lord, I saw the light
 
 I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
 I wouldn't let my Dear Savior in
 Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
 Praise the Lord I saw the light
 
 Just like a blind man I wandered astray
 Straight is the gate and narrow the way
 Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
 Praise the Lord - I saw the light
 
 Well, you're my friend
 And can you see
 Many times we've been out drinking
 Many times we've shared our thoughts
 But did you ever, ever notice
 The kind of thoughts I got?
 Well, you know I have a love
 A love for everyone I know
 And you know I have a drive
 To live, I won't let go
 But can you see this opposition
 Comes rising up sometimes?
 That it's dreadful imposition
 Comes blacking in my mind
 
 And then I see a darkness
 And then I see a darkness
 And then I see a darkness
 And then I see a darkness
 Did you know how much I love you?
 Is a hope that somehow you
 Can save me from this darkness
 
 Well, I hope that someday, buddy
 We have peace in our lives
 Together or apart
 Alone or with our wives
 And we can stop our whoring
 And pull the smiles inside
 And light it up forever
 And never go to sleep
 My best unbeaten brother
 This isn't all I see
 
 Oh no, I see a darkness
 Oh no, I see a darkness
 Oh no, I see a darkness
 Oh no, I see a darkness
 Did you know how much I love you?
 Is a hope that somehow you
 Can save me from this darkness
 
 Glory hallelujah, I shall not be moved
 Anchored in Jehovah, I shall not be moved 
 Just like the tree that's planted by the waters
 I shall not be moved
 
 In His love abiding, I shall not be moved
 And in Him confiding, I shall not be moved
 Just like the tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 Just like the tree that's planted by the waters
 I shall not be moved
 
 Though all Hell assail me, I shall not be moved
 Jesus will not fail me, I shall not be moved
 Just like the tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 Though the tempest rages, I shall not be moved
 On the rock of ages, I shall not be moved
 Just like the tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 Just like the tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 Just like the tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 I still miss someone
 At my door the leaves are falling 
 The cold wild wind will come
 Sweethearts walk by together
 And I still miss someone
 
 I go out on a party
 And look for a little fun
 But I find a darkened corner
 'Cause I still miss someone
 
 Oh, I never got over those blues eyes
 I see them everywhere
 I miss those arms that held me
 When all the love was there
 
 I wonder if she's sorry
 For leavin' what we'd begun
 There's someone for me somewhere
 And I still miss someone
 
 I still miss someone
 Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
 I see them everywhere
 I miss those arms that held me
 When all the love was there
 
 I wonder if she's sorry
 For leavin' what we'd begun
 There's someone for me somewhere
 And I still miss someone
 
 I still miss someone
 
 
 I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
 I keep my eyes wide open all the time
 I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
 Because you're mine, I walk the line
 
 I find it very, very easy to be true
 I find myself alone when each day's through
 Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
 Because you're mine, I walk the line
 
 As sure as night is dark and day is light
 I keep you on my mind both day and night
 And happiness I've known proves that it's right
 Because you're mine, I walk the line
 
 You've got a way to keep me on your side
 You give me cause for love that I can't hide
 For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
 Because you're mine, I walk the line
 
 I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
 I keep my eyes wide open all the time
 I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
 Because you're mine, I walk the line
 
 We sailed on the ship John B my grandfather and me around Nassau town we did roam
 Drinking all night got into a fight well I feel so homesick I wanna go home
 
 So hoist up the John B sail see how the mainsail sets
 Call for the captain ashore let me go home
 
 Let me go home why don't you let me go home
 Well I feel so homesick I wanna go home
 
 The first mate he got drunk broke up the people's trunk
 Constable had to come and take him away
 
 Sheriff John Stone why don't you leave me alone
 Well I feel so homesick I wanna go home
 
 Then the cook he caught the fits threw out all of my grits
 Then he took and ate up all of my corn
 
 Let me go home why don't you let me go home
 Well this is the worst trip since I have been born
 
 So hoist up the John B sail.
 
 I Wanted So to tell that old man, Oh so many things
 Like the corn was 10 feet tall, that he had planted in the sping
 And the books he'd ordered came in in the mail just yesterday
 But he never said a word and life slowly slipped away
 
 I Wanted So to tell him just how much he meant to me
 I Wanted So to thank him for what he taught me that I could be
 I wanted him to know, that his grandchildren all were there
 And that his four year old grandson said "Papa, I said a prayer"
 
 I wanted to apologize for always being on the go
 For never having enough time to talk about the things that he needed so
 I Wanted So to tell him "Pop, your loved ones all are here"
 But he just lay there with his eyes closed, and I think he she'd a knowing tear
 
 Yes, I Wanted So to tell that old man, Oh so many things
 Like the corn was 10 feet tall, that he had planted in the sping
 And the books he'd ordered came in, in the mail just yesterday
 But he never said a word and life just slowly slipped away
 
 There are some people who say we cannot tell
 Whether we are saved or whether all is well
 They say we only can hope and trust that it is so
 Well, I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know
 
 Yes, I know when Jesus saved me 
 The very moment He forgave me 
 He took away my heavy burdens
 Lord, He gave me peace within 
 
 Satan can't make me doubt it 
 It's real and I'm gonna shout it 
 I was there when it happened
 And so I guess I ought to know
 
 I don't care who tells me salvation is not real
 Though the world may argue, that we cannot feel
 The heavy burden's lifted and the vile sins go
 I was there when it happened and so I guess I ought to know
 
 Yes, I know when Jesus saved me 
 The very moment He forgave me 
 He took away my heavy burdens
 Lord, He gave me peace within 
 
 Satan can't make me doubt it 
 It's real and I'm gonna shout it 
 I was there when it happened
 And so I guess I ought to know
 
 I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know 
 But I'll have a memory to keep you near 
 
 In my heart you will remain but it just won't be the same 
 I will miss a million things that make you dear
 
 Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep 
 You're happiness so you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be 
 
 I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you 
 My but I will surely miss you when you go 
 
 Your lovely ways make you
 
 They used to call me Rockabilly
 All of us ran through
 When Elvis opened up the door
 With a pup-and-pup-and-boo
 
 I didn't ever play much rock and roll
 'Cause I got so much country in my soul
 But I'm a different man for lovin' you
 And I take a shot at what you ask me to
 
 And baby I will rock and roll with you
 If I have to
 
 Memphis 1955 on Newton Avenue
 Carl and Jerry and Charlie and Roy
 And Billy Riley too
 
 A new sun risin' on the way we sing
 And a world of weirdo's waitin' in the wings
 But I love you and though I'm past 42
 There are still a few things yet I didn't do
 
 And baby I will rock and roll with you
 If I have to
 
 I met an old friend this morning
 And I stopped him and called him by name
 I said, "The years haven't changed you
 But he said, "Good Lord, how you've changed!"
 
 So we stood there and talked on the corner
 And remembered the good times we had
 Then he asked if we're happy together
 And I only smiled and I said
 
 "Yes, she keeps me off the streets
 And she keeps me out of trouble
 Sometimes at night, Lord, when I hear the wind
 I wish I was crazy again, yes, I wish I was crazy again"
 
 Then we stopped in at a tavern
 We had us a round or two
 We called ourselves old desperado's, old desperado's
 As old friends are likely to do
 
 We sat for a while and remembered
 Then he said, "Let's have just one more"
 I said, "I'd sure like to join you
 But best be goin' on home"
 
 "Yes, she keeps me off the streets
 She keeps me off the streets"
 
 Well, I won't back down, no I won't back down
 You can stand me up at the gates of Hell
 But I won't back down
 
 Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around
 And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down
 Gonna stand my ground and I won't back down
 
 Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
 Hey, I will stand my ground and I won't back down
 
 Well, I know what's right, I got just one life
 In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
 But I stand my ground and I won't back down
 
 Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
 Hey, I will stand my ground and I won't back down
 No, I won't back down
 
 When I come to the river at the ending of day
 When the last winds of sorrow have blown
 There'll be somebody waiting to show me the way I won't have to cross Jordan alone
 I won't have to cross Jordan alone Jesus died all my sins to atone
 In the darkness I see he'll be waiting for me I won't have to cross Jordan alone
 
 Often times I'm weary and troubled and sad
 When it seems that my friends have all flown
 There is one thought that cheers me and makes my heart glad
 I won't have to cross Jordan alone
 I won't have to cross Jordan...
 
 Though the billows of trouble and sorrow may sweep
 Christ the Saviour will care for his own
 Till the end of my journey my soul he will keep and I won't have to cross Jordan alone
 I won't have to cross Jordan...
 
 Oh please don't be so careless with your glances 
 Don't look at me that way and breathe a sigh 
 Please don't get too close and let me love you 
 'Cause I just might be fool enough to try 
 
 It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you 
 But memories from the past I still recall 
 Please don't get too close and let me love you 
 'Cause I just might be fool enough to fall 
 
 It's not that I don't think...
 
 I'd rather die young than grow old without you 
 So don't ever leave me whatever you do 
 To see someone's picture where my picture hung 
 Believe me my darling I'd rather die young 
 I'd rather die young than grow old without you 
 So don't ever leave me whatever you do 
 Though others may tempt you and tell you they care 
 You'll find only sorrow in a secret affair 
 Don't leave me never leave me please don't leave me never leave me 
 I'd rather die young.. 
 
 I'd rather die young...
 
 I overlooked a lot of things I knew I should have done 
 I did things that I'm sorry for I lived to have my fun 
 But now the world that once was bright is empty and bare 
 And if you wouldn't be ashamed of me I'd still be there 
 I'd be with you where I belong 
 And nothing they could do or say could make me think it's wrong 
 If all the love that made you mine could make you still care 
 I'd be by your side I'd still be there 
  
 I'd give the world if I could only have you close to me 
 I'd pray the Lord to keep you safe wherever you may be 
 Don't let anybody share the things we used to share 
 If I only knew you loved me too I'd still be there 
 I'd be with you where I belong... 
 I'd be by your side I'd still be there
 
 The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
 I dreamed I held you in my arms
 But when I awoke dear, I was mistaken
 So I hung my head and I cried
 
 You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
 You make me happy when skies are gray
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you
 Please don't take my sunshine away
 
 I'll always love you and make you happy
 If you will only say the same
 But if you leave me and love another
 You'll regret it all some day
 
 You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
 You make me happy when skies are gray
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you
 Please don't take my sunshine away
 
 You told me once dear, you really loved me
 And no one else could come between
 But now you've left me and love another
 You have shattered all of my dreams
 
 You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
 You make me happy when skies are gray
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you
 Please don't take my sunshine away
 
 In all my dreams dear, you seem to leave me
 When I awake my poor heart pains
 So when you come back and make me happy
 I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame
 
 You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
 You make me happy when skies are gray
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you
 Please don't take my sunshine away
 
 Some glad morning when this life is o'er,
 I'll fly away.
 To that home on God's celestial shore,
 I'll fly away.
 
 I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.
 When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,
 I'll fly away.
 Just a few more weary days and then,
 I'll fly away.
 
 To that land where joy will never end,
 I'll fly away.
 I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away.
 When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,
 I'll fly away.
 
 Oh I'll fly away, oh glory, I'll fly away in the morning
 When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,
 I'll fly away.
 
 Way out on the mountain near the sky hiding from the cold realities of life
 Shaking that old road dust off my heels I give my heart and mind the chance to heal
 Then I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again
 More than likely ride back to the places I have been
 In fairness to my music and my friends so I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again
 A raccoon stole my minnows in the night I appreciate his need and his appetite
 But like me he doesn't have to roam Lord it's true that man can't live on bread alone
 So I'll go somewhere
 
 Oh it feels so good to have a simple wish where life and death is me and some old fish
 Poor king sits with a cold beer in his hand
 And he surveys a clear blue kingdom on the sand
 So I'll go somewhere
 
 I'll take you home again Kathleen
 Across the ocean wild and wide
 To where your heart has ever been
 Since first you were my pleasant bride
 The roses all have left your cheek
 I watch them fade away and die
 
 Your voice is sadden when you speak
 And tears bedim your loving eyes
 Oh, would I will take you back Kathleen
 To where your heart will feel no pain
 And when the fields are fresh and green
 I will take you to your home again
 
 I'm a drifter, a lonesome drifter
 Got no place to call my home no more
 I'm a wanderer, a lonesome wanderer
 Got no one to call my own no more
 
 Got no strings to tie me down
 Got no cause to hang around
 What difference does it make which way I go
 Got an empty feelin' deep inside
 Still I need to stay alive
 And who can tell what waits beyond this road
 
 I'm a drifter, a lonesome drifter
 Got no one to call my own no more
 
 Got no strings to tie me down
 Got no cause to hang around
 What difference does it make which way I go
 Got an empty feelin' deep inside
 Still I need to stay alive
 Who can tell what waits beyond this road
 I'm a drifter, a lonesome drifter
 Got no one to call my own no more
 
 Got no one to call my own no more
 
 I'm a drifter, lonesome drifter
 Got no place to call my home no more
 I'm a wanderer, lonesome wanderer
 Got no one to call my own no more
 
 Got no strings to tie me down

 What difference does it make which way I go
 Got an empty feelin' down inside

 Got no one to call my own no more
 
 I'M A WORRIED MAN
 WRITERS JOHNNY CASH, June CARTER CASH
 
     The place I go to draw my pay, Closed the door on me today. Told me just to stay away, And don't come back again. Ahh: I told my Mama: "Baby, don't you cry. "I'll get a job before the day go by." I don't know where, and that is why, I'm a worried man.  Worried man, a worried man.   I'm a very worried man. Hungry babies don't understand, And their Papa is a worried man. Papa is a worried man.   There is no way that I can see, That I can feed my family,  I don't own a money tree: An' I don't own no land. Now listen: I've got muscle and I've got brains. I don't mind the sun an' the rain. I gotta make a little change, As I'm a worried, worried, worried man, ooh.  Worried man, a worried man.   I'm a very worried man.  Hungry babies don't understand, And their Papa is a worried man. Their Papa is a worried man.      
 
 I've been a rambler, I've been a gambler
 I've been in trouble a time or two
 I known a lot good looking women
 But Lord, bless the day that I found You
 
 I'm alright now, I'm alright now
 I was ridin' on the devil's train but I got off somehow
 I'm alright now, I'm alright
 Gabriel, let your trumpet blow, I'm alright now
 
 I've been demented, been discontented
 I've been in jail pretty close to hell
 I've been frisky on sipping whiskey, yeah
 And I done a few other things that I'll never tell
 
 But I'm alright now
 I'm alright now
 I'm alright now
 
 I'm an easy rider, the wind is at my back
 I'm an easy rider, the white line is my track
 Every lane is a passin' lane and the ride away is mine
 Let me on that straight-away and I'll be fairly flyin'
 
 I'm an easy rider, my wheels love to roll
 I'm an easy rider, I ride a new road every day
 I'm an easy rider, I will see you on my way
 
 I got a number down in every town in my little black book
 And they understand that I'm a travelin' man
 So they don't think they got hooked
 I'm an easy rider, I love that gray highway
 
 I'm an easy rider, oh Lord, I love to roll
 I'm an easy rider, movin's in my soul
 I know a lady down in Little Rock and I stopped for a little while
 But I had to go 'cause another I know is waitin' for my smile
 
 I'm an easy rider, I can't stay in one place
 
 On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
 And cast a wishful eye
 To Canaan's fair and happy land,
 Where my possessions lie. 
 
 I am bound for the promised land,
 I am bound for the promised land;
 Oh who will come and go with me?
 I am bound for the promised land. 
 
 O'er all those wide extended plains
 Shines one eternal day;
 There God the Son forever reigns,
 And scatters night away. 
 
 I am bound for the promised land,
 I am bound for the promised land;
 Oh who will come and go with me?
 I am bound for the promised land. 
 
 No chilling winds or poisonous breath
 Can reach that healthful shore;
 Sickness and sorrow, pain and death,
 Are felt and feared no more. 
 
 I am bound for the promised land,
 I am bound for the promised land;
 Oh who will come and go with me?
 I am bound for the promised land. 
 
 When I shall reach that happy place,
 I'll be forever blessed,
 For I shall see my Father's face,
 And in His bosom rest.
 
 I got rid of the shackles that bound me and the guards that were always around me 
 There were tears on the mail mother sent me in jail 
 But I'm free from the chain gang now 
 Back home I was known and respected then one day I was wrongly suspected 
 So they put me in chains in a cold freezin' rain but I'm free from the chain gang now 
 
 All the years I was known by a number how I kept my mind is a wonder 
 And the bare prison cell that was one step from hell 
 But I'm free from the chain gang now 
 I prayed that the gossip will spare me when I return to the one I will marry 
 Like a bird in a tree I got my liberty and I'm free from the chain gang now
 
 Bring a drink of water Leroy
 Bring a drink of water, no
 If I could get to the mercy man
 He'd give me some I know
 
 I got a gal in Vicksburg
 Bertha is her name
 Wish I's tied to Bertha
 Instead of this ball and chain
 
 I'm goin' to Memphis, that's right Lord, yeah
 
 A dude took all my money
 Wouldn't let me see the cards
 I owe the boss about a hundred years
 For sleepin' in his backyard
 
 I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis
 Yeah I'm goin' to Memphis
 
 Like a bitter weed, I'm a bad seed
 But when that levee's through and I am too
 Let the honky tonk roll on
 Come mornin' I'll be gone
 
 I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis
 
 I never been to Chicago
 But it must be a mighty fine place, that's right
 I couldn't get past Tennessee
 With Mississippi all over my face
 
 I'm goin' to Memphis, that's right Lord, Memphis
 
 Well, the freezin' ground at night
 Is my own foldin' bed
 Pork salad is my bread and meat
 And it will be till I'm dead
 
 Well, I brought me a little water
 In a Mr. Prince Albert can
 But the boss man caught me drinkin' it
 And I believe, he broke my hand
 
 They all call me crazy for sassin' Mr. Scott
 My brother was killed for a deed I did
 But I dis remember what, yeah
 
 Well another boy is down
 The shovel burned him out
 Let me stand on his body
 To see what the shoutin's about
 
 I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah I'm goin' to Memphis
 
 Like a bitter weed, I'm a bad seed
 But when that levee's through and I am too
 Let the honky tonk roll on
 Come mornin' I'll be gone
 
 I'm goin' to Memphis, yeah Memphis
 
 I'm gonna sit on the porch and pick on my old guitar
 I'm gonna lay on my back and laugh at my lucky star
 And then I'm gonna fly away and never come back someday
 'Less I thought I was gonna land right close to where you are
 
 Well, if I thought anybody cared I'd send back word
 Strapped to the leg of a trans celestial bird
 I wonder if I really ever did leave how many would there be to grieve?
 How would they react to the word?
 
 Well, I wouldn't ever want to hurt a solitary soul
 I have still got all 6 foot 2 in control
 But when my obligation's low is a greasy uphill road
 And pleasin' everybody but me is my first goal
 
 I want to sit on my porch and pick on my old guitar
 And just hope you're hangin' loose where ever you are
 And for the joy you brought to me this song I sung for thee
 While I sit on my porch and pick on my old guitar
 
 I'm gonna try to be that way
 Once upon a time there lived a man
 Many years ago in a foreign land
 Knew how to live right, tried to be a light
 Gave everybody a helping hand
 
 I'm gonna try to be that way
 I'm gonna try to be that way
 Do the kind of things a man oughta do
 Say the kind of things a man oughta say
 I'm gonna try to be that way
 
 He never done anybody wrong
 He tried to help everybody 'long
 He brought a better land to make a better man
 Out of the rich or the poor
 Or the weak or the strong
 
 And he preached love and brotherhood
 He went around doin' good, doin' good
 Everywhere he went
 They knew that he was sent
 And the people started actin' like they should
 
 I'm just an old chunk of coal
 But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
 I'm gonna grow and glow
 'Til I'm so blue pure perfect
 I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
 But I'm gonna kneel and pray everyday
 Lest I should become vain along the way
 I'm just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
 But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
 
 I'm gonna learn the right way to talk
 I'm gonna search and find a better way to walk
 I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
 'Til I get rid of every single flaw
 I'm gonna be the world's best friend
 I'm gonna go around shaking everybody's hand
 I'm gonna be the cotton-pickin' Rage of the Age
 Yes I'm gonna be a diamond some day 
 
 I said I'm just an old chunk of coal now Lord
 But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
 
 Down at the railroad station there's people gettin' on
 Some are a goin' north some are a goin' south I'm just goin' to be gone
 Some people are born to be takers others just want to give
 Some people live just to love but I just love to live
 For I was just born to be exactly what you see
 Nothing more or less I'm not the worst or the best
 I just try to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me
 
 When people say their life is rough I wonder compared to what
 Some are wantin' more and more's gettin' less I just want what I've got
 Some want to live on a hill others down by the sea
 Some want to live inside high walls I just want to live free
 For I was just born...
 Oh I was just born to be exactly what you see today and every day I'm just me
 
 Hold on honey I'd like to say
 I'm busting out and breaking away
 I'm letting you go like a hot horse shoe
 I can't take another heart ache from you
 
 Think about how it's gonna be
 When you start back to needing me
 When your dancing shoes have lost their shine
 I'm gonna be gone in mine
 
 I'm leaving now
 I'm leaving now
 Get out of my face
 Get out of my place
 I'm leaving now, adios
 I'm leaving now
 
 And the time it comes when you trim the fat
 Feed the kitchen scraps to the front seat cat
 Bye bye baby when the bills come due
 You might have to give up a jewel or two
 
 Eat your heart out anyway
 It's hard as your head and it's cold as clay
 It's all over now you won't have me
 Your sugar daddy or your money tree
 
 I'm leaving now yeah
 I'm leaving now
 Get out of my space
 Get out of my face
 I'm leaving now, hey hey
 I'm leaving now
 
 Pull up the collar on my traveling coat
 Sell that miserable pleasure boat
 I wouldn't give a nickel for another buck
 I'm living on muscle, guts, and luck
 
 If anybody asks where did I go
 Tell 'em I went where the wild goose goes
 I wouldn't have me an area code
 Don't have a number, don't need a row
 
 I'm leaving now 
 I'm leaving now
 Get out of my face
 Get out of my space
 I'm leaving now, adios
 I'm leaving now
 
 I'm leaving now
 I'm leaving now
 Get out of my space
 Get out of my face
 I'm leaving now, adios
 I'm leaving now
 
 That big eight-wheeler rollin' down the track
 Means your true-lovin' daddy ain't comin' back
 'Cause I'm movin' on, I'll soon be gone
 You were flyin' too high, for my little old sky
 So I'm movin' on
 That big loud whistle as it blew and blew
 Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
 When we're movin' on, oh hear my song
 You had the laugh on me, so I've set you free
 And I'm movin' on
 Mister fireman won't you please listen to me
 'Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
 Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
 So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll
 And keep movin' me on
 Mister Engineer, take that throttle in hand
 This rattler's the fastest in the southern land
 To keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
 You gonna ease my mind, put me there on time
 And keep rollin' on
 I've told you baby, from time to time
 But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
 Now I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on
 You've broken your vow, and it's all over now
 So I'm movin' on
 You've switched your engine now I ain't got time
 For a triflin' woman on my main line
 Cause I'm movin on, you done your daddy wrong
 I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
 'Cause I'm movin on
 But someday baby when you've had your play
 You're gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
 Keep movin' on, you stayed away too long
 I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
 Keep movin' on
 
 Hey little girl is your daddy home?
 Did he go away and leave you all alone?
 I got a bad desire
 I'm on fire
 
 Tell me now baby is he good to you?
 Can he do to you the things that I do?
 I can take you higher
 I'm on fire
 
 It's like someone took a knife
 Edgy and dull, dug a six-inch valley
 In the middle of my skull
 
 At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
 And a freight train running through the middle of my head
 Only you can cool my desire
 Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
 Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
 
 Hey little girl is your daddy home?
 Did he go away and leave you all alone?
 I got a bad desire
 Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
 
 And tell me now baby is he good to you?
 Can he do to you the things that I do?
 I can take you higher
 Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
 I'm on fire
 
 I'm on fire
 
 Well I've come here to tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right 
 I'm a tramp and a gambler I stay out late at night 
 But a porterhouse steak steak three times a day for my board 
 That's more than any loafer in this old town can afford 
 Well I got big electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep 
 A little baby boy playin' rounds at my feet 
 I'm a rambler and a gambler and I've lead a dirty life 
 Well I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right 
 Well then I got married I knew I'd settle down 
 And I built a little love nest right here in my hometown 
 Now I've got a family one that I'm proud of 
 I know that I'll be happy cause they're the ones I love 
 Well I got big electric fan
 
 I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right 
 I'm a rambler and a gambler I've lead a dirty life 
 Well I tell you folks I'm ragged but I'm right
 
 Hear that lonesome whippoorwill?
 He sounds too blue to fly.
 The midnight train is whining low:
 I'm so lonesome I could cry.
 
 I've never seen a night so long,
 When time goes crawling by.
 The moon just went behind a cloud,
 To hide its face and cry.
 
 Did you ever see a Robin weep,
 When leaves begin to die?
 That means he's lost his will to live.
 I'm so lonesome I could cry.
 
 The silence of a falling star,
 Lights up a purple sky.
 And as I wonder where you are,
 I'm so lonesome I could cry.
 I'm so lonesome I could cry.
 
 I'm with a crowd but oh so alone
 I still have the picture you sent me
 And you signed it with love you recall
 And the one of me that you wanted
 Is now hanging face to the wall
 At night I'm never alone
 I'm afraid that I'll weaken and phone
 And I'm afraid that you will be gone
 I'm with a crowd but oh so alone
 
 I was toting my pack along the long dusty Winnemucca road
 When along came a semi with a high canvas covered load
 If your goin' to Winnemucca, Mack with me you can ride
 And so I climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside
 He asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand
 And I said, "Listen! I've traveled every road in this here land!"

 Train train train I've got a thing about trains
 I get a sad kind of feeling when I see a passenger train
 
 In this fast movin' world that we live in nobody rides 'em much these days
 Maybe I'm a little sentimental cause I know that things have to change
 But I'd still like to go for a train ride cause I've got a thing about trains
 
 Train train train you're fading from the scene
 But you've had your days of glory train train train
 
 Train they say you're too slow for travelin' but I'm gonna miss you some day
 When my little boy says daddy what was it like to ride a train
 I'll just say it was a good way to travel when things didn't move quite so fast
 And I'm sorry son that you can't ride one the trains are the thing of the past
 
 Train train train you're fading from the scene
 And I'm gonna mourn your passing train train train
 I've got a thing about trains
 
 You'd have thought a king had died 
 The way those people cried
 Instead of one more broken entertainer
 It struck those in his trade 
 He could have had it made
 If he'd only been a little saner
 They traveled far to see him
 Oh, the humble and the high
 They said goodbye as if he were a friend
 
 Now somewhere he is smiling
 On those who idolized him
 But would they even recognize him
 If he came back again?
 
 He was born of modest means 
 But had outrageous dreams
 They never let him rest 
 Till he fulfilled them
 While he rode that train of song 
 His devils tagged along
 The whiskey and the pills 
 Just couldn't kill him
 He didn't mean to be a rebel
 Ah, the real ones never do
 They're born apart from ordinary men
 
 Now somewhere he is smiling 
 On those who sanctified him
 But would they even recognize him
 If he came back again?
 
 It's an old familiar story
 But it's a damn shame none-the-less
 They don't forgive his kind
 Till they lay them down to rest
 
 Now somewhere he is smiling 
 On those who idolized him
 But would they even recognize him
 If he came back again?
 Oh, if he came back again
 
 Down a dangerous road, I have come to where I'm standing
 With a heavy heart, and my hat clutched in my hand
 Such a foolish fool, God ain't known no greater sinner
 I have come in search of Jesus, hoping he will understand
 
 I had a woman once; she was kind, and she was gentle
 Had a child by me, who grew up to be a man
 I had a steady job till I started into drinking
 And I started making music that went with the devil's band
 
 Oh, the years flew by like a mighty rush of eagles
 My dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
 It's a lonesome life when you lose the ones you live for
 If I make my peace with Jesus, will they take me back again?
 
 If I give my soul, will he cleanse these clothes I'm wearin'?
 If I give my soul, will he put new boots on my feet?
 If I bow my head and beg God for his forgiveness
 Will he breathe new breath inside me, and give back my dignity?
 
 If I give my soul, will he stop my hands from shaking?
 If I give my soul, will my son love me again?
 If I give my soul, and she knows I really mean it
 If I give my soul to Jesus, will she take me back again?
 
 If I give my soul to Jesus, will she take me back again?
 
 If I had a hammer
 I'd hammer in the morning
 I'd hammer in the evening
 All over this land
 I'd hammer out danger
 I'd hammer out a warning
 I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sisters
 All over this land
 
 If I had a bell
 I'd ring it in the morning
 I'd ring it in the evening
 All over this land
 I'd ring out danger
 I'd ring out a warning
 I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters
 All over this land
 
 If I had a song
 I'd sing it in the morning
 I'd sing it in the evening
 All over this land
 I'd sing out danger
 I'd sing out a warning
 I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters
 All over this land
 
 Well I've got a hammer
 And I've got a bell
 And I've got a song to sing
 All over this land
 It's the hammer of justice
 It's the bell of freedom
 It's the song about love between my brothers and my sisters
 All over this land
 
 I was down in music city 'bout a week ago
 I wanted to see the brand old Loper show
 So I held a cap and I headed down to Opryland
 They said they sold their last ticked the day before
 So I kinda just hung around the backstage door
 And down the steps she came, men oh men
 My favourite female country star
 She waved her fans and headed for her car
 Her tire, unlike her body, was very flat
 She said, could you change my tire
 I said your wish is my desire
 As she raised the lid, I grabbed her bomber jack
 She said I sure do appreciate you're changing my tire
 
 If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
 You'd say I was making it up
 You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
 You'd think I was making it up
 She said it was our little secret and by golly
 Oh I'm gonna keep it
 Anyway you wouldn't believe it
 If I told you who it was
 
 She said you need a lift and I said well
 You can drop me of at the York motel
 So we headed down Briley parkway in the town
 I told her I got all your records ma'am
 She smiled and said well I be damned
 She said, you're kind of cute fellar, wanna mess around?
 When we got to my room just the people lied
 I said sure wish I could've heard you sing tonight
 She smiled at me and said what do you wanna hear?
 Well if I was one of them country music folks
 I'll tell you, she'd sure get my vote for the best performance of the year
 
 If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
 You'd say I was making it up
 You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
 You'd think I was making it up
 She said it was our little secret and by golly
 Oh I'm gonna keep it
 Anyway you wouldn't believe it
 If I told you who it was
 
 Well I tell you this much
 When I put my arms around her and squeezed her real tight
 She looked up at me with those big beautiful eyes
 Took a deep breath in the side and said:
 "Howdy I'm just so proud to be here!"
 
 If I told you who it was, if I told you who it was
 You'd say I was making it up
 You've seen her on the screen and in country magazines
 You'd think I was making it up
 She said it was our little secret and by golly
 Oh I'm gonna keep it
 Anyway you wouldn't believe it
 If I told you who it was
 
 If I were a carpenter
 And you were a lady
 Would you marry me anyway
 Would you have my baby?
 
 If you were a carpenter
 And I were a lady
 I'd marry you anyway
 I'd have your baby
 
 If a tinker was my trade
 Would I still find you
 I'd be carrying the pots you made
 Following behind you
 Save your love through loneliness
 Save your love through sorrow
 I gave you my onlyness
 Give me your tomorrow
 
 If I were a miller
 And a mill wheel grinding
 Would you miss your colored blouse
 And your soft shoes shining?
 
 If you were a miller
 And a mill wheel grinding
 I'd not miss my colored blouse
 And my soft shoes shining
 
 Save your love through loneliness
 Save your love through sorrow
 I gave you my onlyness
 Give me your tomorrow
 
 If I worked my hands on wood
 Would you still love me?
 I'd answer you yes I would
 And would you not be above me?
 
 If I were a carpenter
 And you were a lady
 I'd marry you anyway
 I'd have your baby
 
 Save your love through loneliness
 Save your love through sorrow
 I gave you my onlyness
 Give me your tomorrow
 
 
 If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
 Was the woman that He loved
 If Jesus ever loved a woman
 It was Mary Magdalene
 
 His life was pure perfection
 And He never did no sin, nor lust nor greed
 And He fell to no temptation
 And only did His Father know about His human need
 
 And many were the women and the men
 Who followed each place He was seen
 From seven dirty devils
 Did He free the soul of Mary Magdalene
 
 If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
 Was the woman, Jesus loved
 If Jesus ever loved a woman
 It was Mary Magdalene
 
 He never did condemn a man, a woman
 Just for being man, or woman
 And He always will forgive
 If someone tells Him, that they're really truly sorry
 
 But He couldn't stand a hypocrite
 A person who'd pretend that they were holy
 And we're not
 I'd think He'd loved someone like Mary Magdalene, quiet a lot
 
 If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
 Was the woman that He loved
 If Jesus ever loved a woman, it was Mary Magdalene
 If Jesus ever loved a woman, I think Mary Magdalene
 Was the woman that He loved
 If Jesus ever loved a woman, it was Mary Magdalene
 
 If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays down
 I'll be in your arms time the moon come around
 For a taste of love that's shining in your eyes
 If the rooster crows at the crackin' of the dawn
 I'll be there just as sure as you're born
 If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
 
 I'll comb my hair down, brush my teeth
 Shine up, slick up, dress up neat
 Get everything looking just right
 'Cause I want to look pretty when I see you tonight
 Just as sure as the rabbits are a jumping in the hollow
 I'll be there, you can bet your bottom dollar
 If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
 
 If the good Lord's willing and the creek stays low
 I'll be there a knockin' at your door
 With a hug and a kiss for the one I idolize
 
 I'll wear my suit, my Sunday best
 I'll be there lookin' my best
 If the good Lord's willing and the creeks don't rise
 
 I'll feed the mules and stop the hogs 
 Feed the cows and chop all the logs
 Get all of my working done 'cause tonight we're gonna have lots of fun
 Just as sure as there ever was a preacher man
 I'll be there with a ring for your hand
 If the good Lord's willing and the creek don't rise
 
 I will meet you on that beautiful shore
 
 Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
 And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
 Till we gather in Heaven's bright city
 Far away on that beautiful shore
 
 If we never meet again this side of Heaven
 As we struggle through this world and its strife
 There's another meeting place somewhere in Heaven
 By the side of the river of life
 
 Where the charming roses bloom forever
 And where separation comes no more
 If we never meet again this side of Heaven
 I will meet you on that beautiful shore
 
 Oh they say we shall meet by the river
 Where no storm clouds ever darken the sky
 And they say we'll be happy in Heaven
 In the wonderful sweet by and by
 
 If we never meet again this side of heaven
 As we struggle through this world and its strife
 There's another meeting place somewhere in Heaven
 By the side of the river of life
 
 Where the charming roses bloom forever
 And where separation comes no more
 If we never meet again this side of Heaven
 I will meet you on that beautiful shore
 
 If we never meet again this side of Heaven
 I will meet you on that beautiful shore
 Beautiful, beautiful shore
 
 If you could read my mind, love,
 What a tale my thoughts could tell.
 Just like an old time movie,
 'Bout a ghost from a wishing well.
 In a castle dark or a fortress strong,
 With chains upon my feet.
 You know that ghost is me.
 And I will never be set free
 As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.
 
 If I could read your mind, love,
 What a tale your thoughts could tell.
 Just like a paperback novel,
 The kind the drugstores sell.
 When you reached the part where the heartaches come,
 The hero would be me.
 But heroes often fail,
 And you won't read that book again
 Because the ending's just too hard to take!
 
 I'd walk away like a movie star
 Who gets burned in a three way script.
 Enter number two,
 A movie queen to play the scene
 Of bringing all the good things out in me.
 But for now, love, let's be real,
 I never thought I could act this way
 And I've got to say that I just don't get it.
 I don't know where we went wrong,
 But the feeling's gone
 And I just can't get it back.

 And if you read between the lines,
 You'll know that I'm just tryin' to understand
 The feelings that you lack.
 I never thought I could feel this way
 And I've got to say that I just don't get it.
 I don't know where we went wrong,

 Hand me my guitar there's a song that I was singing
 Back when I was young and I had a good time
 Looking for love in the misty waters of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind
 
 Only in shadows and lonely at night she turns to you softly you turn on the light
 You use her abuse her and you know it ain't right to treat one who loves you so badly
 When she's doing the best that she can you know she's doing the best that she can
 
 Do you believe in dreams do you believe in dreamers
 Hoping that you'll find what you're looking for
 You don't have to worry cause there's a bright tomorrow
 In the dreams that roll in a young girl's mind
 Only in shadows
 So hand me my guitar
 Of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind
 
 There are places I'll remember
 All my life
 Though some have changed
 Some forever
 Not for better
 Some have gone and some remain
 All these places have their moments
 With lovers and friends
 I still can recall
 Some are dead and some are living
 In my life
 I've loved them all
 
 But if all these friends and lovers
 There is no one
 Compares with you
 And these memories
 Lose their meaning
 When I think of love
 As something new
 
 Though I know I'll never lose affection
 For people and things that went before
 I know I'll often stop and think about them
 In my life
 I love you more
 
 Though I know I'll never lose affection
 For people and things that went before
 I know I'll often stop and think about them
 In my life
 I love you more
 In my life
 I love you more
 
 I come to the garden alone
 While the dew is still on the roses
 And the voice I hear, falling on my ear
 The Son of God discloses
 And he walks with me
 And he talks with me
 
 And he tells me I am His own
 And the joy we share as we tarry there
 None other has ever known
 
 He speaks and the sound of His voice
 Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
 And the melody that He gave to me
 Within my heart is ringing
 And he walks with me
 And he talks with me
 
 I'd stay in the garden with Him
 'Tho the night around me be falling
 But He bids me go, through the voice of woe
 His voice to me is calling
 And He walks with me
 And He talks with me
 
 I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
 Who used to steal, gamble and rob
 He thought he was the smartest guy in town
 But I found out last Monday
 That Bob got locked up Sunday
 They've got him in the jailhouse way down town.
 
 He's in the jailhouse now
 He's in the jailhouse now
 I told him once or twice
 To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
 He's in the jailhouse now. 
 
 He played a game called poker
 He knuckled with Dan Yoakum
 But shootin' dice was his greatest game
 Now he's downtown in jail
 Nobody to go his bail
 The judge done said that he will pay the fine.
 
 I went out last Tuesday
 Met a girl named Susie
 I told her I was the swellest man around
 We started to spend my money
 Then she started to call me honey
 We took in every cabaret in town.
 
 We're in the jailhouse now
 We're in the jailhouse now
 I told the judge right to his face
 We didn't like to see this place
 We're in the jailhouse now.
 
 There's a land that is fairer than day, 
 And by faith we can see it afar; 
 For the Father waits over the way 
 To prepare us a dwelling place there. 
 In the sweet by and by, 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore; 
 In the sweet by and by, 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore. 
 We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
 The melodious songs of the blessed; 
 And our spirits shall sorrow no more, 
 Not a sigh for the blessing of rest. 
 In the sweet by and by, 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore; 
 In the sweet by and by, 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore. 
 To our bountiful Father above, 
 We will offer our tribute of praise 
 For the glorious gift of His love 
 And the blessings that hallow our days. 
 In the sweet by and by, 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore; 
 In the sweet by and by, 
 We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
 
 When I was a little bitty baby my mama would rock me in my cradle 
 In them old cottonfields back home 
 When I was a little bitty baby... 
 Now when them cotton bolls get rotten you can't pick very much cotton 
 In them old cottonfields back home 
 It was down in Louisiana just about a mile from Texarkana 
 In them old cottonfields back home 
 
 When I was a little bitty baby... 
 When I was a little bitty baby... 
 In them old cottonfields back home in them old cottonfields back home
 
 In your mind, in your mind
 One foot on Jacob's ladder
 And one foot in the fire
 And it all goes down in your mind
 
 Living at the bottom of the stairs in your life
 Never a smile knocking on your door
 The air is blue and so are you
 Prehistoric monsters on the floor
 
 Last verse of your last song
 And God don't hear dead men
 The end of the line is in your mind
 And you'll be staying in
 
 In your mind, in your mind
 Bone for bone and skin for skin
 Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
 Heart for heart and soul for soul
 Somebody said what is true
 
 Lock it up and close it down
 The sound of morning like a dove
 High beyond the rattle and roar
 Look into the face of love
 
 In your mind, in your mind
 One foot on Jacob's ladder
 And one foot in the fire
 And it all goes down in your mind
 
 In your mind, in your mind
 Sunday words are back again
 And you'll eat your fun of the middleman's pie
 But just a piece you understand
 You'll get the rest up in the sky
 
 Praise and glory, wounded angel
 Shuffling round the room
 Eternity is down the hall
 And you sit there bending spoons
 
 In your mind, in your mind
 Father, son and holy ghost
 Sacrificial drops the pain
 On a silver planet cross
 Sanctification on a chain
 
 They say redemption draws knives
 Storms of silence from above
 Stop your ears close your eyes
 Try to find the face of love
 
 In your mind, in your mind
 One foot on Jacob's ladder
 And one foot in the fire
 And it all goes down in your mind
 
 Oh, if you tell a lie
 You know that I'll forgive you
 Though you say our love is just a game
 And when you hear my name
 You'll say I'm from a strange world
 But is it so strange to be in love with you
 
 Is it so strange
 That I love you more than all the world
 Is it so strange
 I have no eyes for any other girl
 
 Oh won't you take me back
 And say that you still love me
 To waste a love like ours would be a sin
 Let us kiss again
 Let me hold you near
 And take me from this strange world
 That I'm living in
 
 Cursed with sorrow pain and woe full of feeling I can't show
 Hopeless love what else for me is this my destiny
 
 At night I toss and wonder why I must live while others die
 The grave would be escape for me from this my destiny
 
 I know God surely made for every man somewhere a maid
 Someone stole my love from me is this my destiny
 
 At night I toss and wonder why
 
 Go away from my window
 Leave at your own chosen speed
 I'm not the one you want, babe
 I'm not the one you need
 You say you're lookin' for someone
 Who's never weak but always strong
 To protect you and defend you
 Whether you are right or wrong
 Someone to open each and every door
 
 But it ain't me babe
 No, no, no, it ain't me babe
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
 
 Go lightly from the ledge, babe
 Go lightly on the ground
 I'm not the one you want, babe
 I'll only let you down
 You say you're lookin' for someone
 Who'll promise never to part
 Someone to close his eyes for you
 Someone to close his heart
 Someone to die for you and more
 
 But it ain't me babe
 No, no, no, it ain't me babe
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
 
 You say you're lookin' for someone
 To pick you up each time you fall
 To gather flowers constantly
 And to come each time you call
 And will love you for your life
 And nothin' more
 
 But it ain't me babe
 No, no, no, it ain't me babe
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe
 
 Go 'way from my window,
 Leave at your own chosen speed.
 I'm not the one you want, babe,
 I'm not the one you need.
 You say you're lookin' for someone
 Never weak but always strong,
 To protect you an' defend you
 Whether you are right or wrong,
 Someone to open each and every door,
 But it ain't me, babe,
 No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
 
 Go lightly from the ledge, babe,
 Go lightly on the ground.
 I'm not the one you want, babe,
 I will only let you down.
 You say you're lookin' for someone
 Who will promise never to part,
 Someone to close his eyes for you,
 Someone to close his heart,
 Someone who will die for you an' more,
 But it ain't me, babe,
 No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
 
 Go melt back into the night, babe,
 Everything inside is made of stone.
 There's nothing in here moving
 An' anyway I'm not alone.
 You say you're looking for someone
 Who'll pick you up each time you fall,
 To gather flowers constantly
 An' to come each time you call,
 A lover for your life an' nothing more,
 But it ain't me, babe,
 No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
 It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
 
 It came upon the midnight clear
 That glorious song of old
 From Angels playing near the earth
 To touch their harps of gold
 
 Peace on the earth could will two men
 From Heaven's all-gracious King
 The world in solemn stillness lay
 To hear the Angels sing
 
 And I hear them singing
 Sing, I do hear them singing
 
 The first Noel the Angel did say
 Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
 In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
 On a cold winter's night that was so deep
 
 If you should meet some lonely soul who on this earth can't reach his gold 
 And he's traveling down the road so dark and dim 
 Lend the hand say a prayer give a smile that he might share 
 But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him 
  
 Be friend each stranger in the night help to make his burdens light 
 Lift up the falling ones and be a friend 
 
 Shed a tear share a sight Share his fears don't pass him by 
 But for the grace of God it could be you instead of him 
  
 Shed a tear share a sight
 
 I don't hurt anymore
 
 All my teardrops're dried
 No more walking the floor
 With that burning inside.
 
 Just to think it could be
 Time has opened the door
 And at last I am free
 I don't hurt anymore.
 
 No use to deny I wanted to die
 The day you said we were through
 But now that I find you're out of my mind
 I can't believe that it's true.
 
 I've forgotten somehow
 That I cared so before
 And it's wonderful now
 I don't hurt anymore.
 
 No use to deny I wanted to die
 The day you said we were through
 But now that I find you're out of my mind
 I can't believe that it's true.
 
 I've forgotten somehow
 That I cared so before
 And it's wonderful now 
 I don't hurt anymore.
 
 The chimes of time ring out the news, another day is through
 Someone slipped and fell, was that someone you?
 You may have longed for added strength, your courage to renew
 Do not be discouraged, for I have news for you
 
 It is no secret what God can do
 What He's done for others, He'll do for you
 With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
 It is no secret what God can do
 
 There is no night for in His light we'll never walk alone
 Always feel at home, wherever you may roam
 There is no power can conquer you while God is on your side
 Just take Him at His promise, don't run away and hide
 
 It is no secret what God can do
 What He's done for others, He'll do for you
 With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
 It is no secret what God can do
 It is no secret what God can do
 
 It's true that I used to be crazy
 And harder to love than most men
 But the blood that ran in these tired old hands
 Was hotter and wilder back then
 
 And I don't feel as tall as I used to
 Maybe it's just that I've grown
 You're the one that held my hand when I fell
 When I just couldn't make it alone
 
 We've lived down all the stories
 I sang all the old songs
 It takes one to know me
 I guess, you're the one
 
 Your daughters a ladies, she's a fortune
 My your son is an heir to the throne
 And this crown that I hold is tarnished and cold
 But it's a symbol of all that we own
 
 Sometimes I wish I was younger
 And could pick up the pieces and run
 But then I look back on the matter of fact
 And it's a race that we've already won
 
 We've lived out all the stories
 Sang all the old songs
 It takes one to know me
 I guess, you're the one
 
 We've lived out all the stories
 Sang all the old songs
 It takes one to know me
 And you knew the one
 
 Well a man walked down by Galilee so the Holy Book does say 
 And a great multitude was gathered there without a thing to eat for days 
 Up stepped a little boy with the basket please take it Lord he said 
 And with just a five loaves and two little fishes five thousand had fish and bread 
 Who was it everybody  who was it everybody  
 Who was it everybody  it was Jesus Christ our Lord 
 Now pay close attention little children it's somebody you ought to know 
 It's all about a man that walked on earth nearly two thousand years ago 
 Well he healed the sick and afflicted it and he raised 'em from the dead 
 Then they nailed him on an old rugged cross and put thorns on his head 
 Who was it everybody
 Well they took him down and they buried him and after the third day 
 When they came to his tomb where they knew he was gone 
 Cause the stone was rolled away 
 He's not here for he is risen the angel of the Lord then said 
 And when they saw him walking with these nail-scared hands 
 They knew he came back from the dead 
 Who was it everybody
 
 I was on my way to you and I was worried
 I was all torn up and nervous 'cause I knew that you'd be gone
 I knocked and crossed my fingers while I waited
 And I couldn't hold the teardrops when I walked away alone
 
 It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed 
 Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
 It's all over, it's all over, so forget her 
 Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go
 
 I was runnin' 'round in circles like a baby
 I was in a daze because I loved you so, I couldn't see
 I was broken in a million little pieces
 When I saw enough to realize, you didn't care for me
 
 It's all over, it's all over, my heart echoed, it's all over
 Every minute that you cry for her is wasted don't you know
 It's all over, it's all over, so forget her 
 Stop your cryin' turn around and let her go
 
 Having a hard time feeling blue, trying to get over you 
 
 Maybe it's just about time I told you I'm all through with you
 But just about the time I start to tell you I start feeling blue
 And just about then I lose my nerve and wait another day or two
 Cause just about the time I think it's over I start missing you
 
 It's just about time I had my sayin' I told you a thing or two
 It's just about time I paid you back you treat me like you do
 But just about the time I get the nerve I can't seem to carry through
 Cause just about then an empty feelin' reminds me I miss you
 
 It's just about time I let you know I've had my fill of you
 But just about the time I think about goin' I start missin' you
 I'd like to go find another love that'll never be untrue
 But just about the time I think about leavin' I start missin' you
 
 We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout,

 Jacob Green got busted for possession
 Next morning early he appeared in court
 But he was sent to jail to wait to be trialed at some later date
 Next morning early, there came a sad report
 
 At the jail they took away his clothes to shame him
 And to make sure Jacob Green had no pride left
 They cut of all his hair today they found him hanging there
 Afraid to face the day he killed himself
 
 It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
 Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
 Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen
 
 It could be someone that you love gets done
 Like Jacob Green got done
 It could be someone that you love gets done
 Like Jacob Green got done
 
 Jacob's father hired a team of lawyers
 Inspections and long inquiries were held
 The sheriff then retired and the papers said two guards were fired
 They put a brand new coat of paint on Jacob's cell
 
 But like a tomb that looks so white and shiny
 Inside you'll find corruption never seen
 And somewhere out there tonight in a dirty cell without a light
 There will be locked up another Jacob Green
 
 It happened yesterday and if you turn your head away
 Somewhere in some dirty hole the scene will be rerun
 Not only Jacob Green, but many more you've never seen
 
 It could be someone that you love gets done
 Like Jacob Green got done
 It could be someone that you love gets done
 Like Jacob Green got done
 
 Don't ever kiss no one but me
 If you do, dear, you'll break my heart
 It's not because I doubt you
 But I'm such a fool about you
 I've got a jealous lovin' heart
 
 Now where there's love, there's jealousy
 Good and bad just won't tear apart
 They always go together
 Like fair and stormy weather
 I've got a jealous lovin' heart
 
 You're all I want 
 You're all I need 
 Please don't tear my soul apart
 Just say you love me, too, dear
 Then be careful what you do, dear
 I've got a jealous lovin' heart

 Jesus was a carpenter and He worked with a saw and a hammer
 And His hands could join a table true enough to stand forever
 And He might have spun His life out in the coolness of the morning
 But He put aside His tools and He walked the burning highways
 And He built His house from people just like these
 
 And He found them as they wandered through the wild Judean mountains
 And He found them as they pulled their nets upon the Sea of Galilee
 And for a thousand evenings while the day behind Him emptied
 He put aside His tools and stopped to touch the dying
 And He built His house from people just like these
 
 It was on a storming Sunday when He rode to old Jerusalem
 And the palms they cast before Him
 Were like the crimes they laid against Him
 It was on a storming Friday when He climbed the streets to Calvary
 And where He died today why they're selling beads and postcards
 And they tell us too that that was long ago
 
 But would He stand today upon the sands of California
 And walk the sweating blacktop of New York and Mississippi?
 Would He be a guest on Sunday, a vagrant on a Monday?
 With the doors locked tight against His kind you know
 
 Oh, come again now Jesus be a carpenter among us
 There are chapels in our discontent, cathedrals to our sorrows
 And we dwell in golden mansions with the sand for our foundations
 And the raging water's rising and the thunder's all around us
 Won't You come and build a house on rock again
 
 Jesus was a carpenter and He worked with a saw and a hammer
 And His hands could form a table true enough to stand forever
 
 
 Last time, last time we were here at Folsom Prison,
 They were hanging Joe Bean.
 Is Joe still here, Joe Bean?
 Hang the son of a bitch anyways, right?
 
 Well, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning, for killing a man in Arkansas.
 Funny thing about it, Joe Bean has never been to Arkansas.
 On top of that, Joe Bean never heard of the man.
 In fact, today is Joe Bean's twentieth birthday.
 
 See through the prison bars, Joe Bean, see where the gallows stand.
 Just twenty short years from the day you were born, you died by the hangman's hand.
 
 Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning, for a shooting that he never did.
 He killed 20 men, by the time he was 10, he was an unruly kid.
 
 Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting that Joe Bean never did.
 
 Well, Joe, your mother is at the Capitol, asking the governor for a stay.
 And it's hard on her, 'cause she knows where you were, on that particular day.
 You were working Joe Bean, hard working, robbing the Santa Fe.
 
 Well, the telegraph wires are humming.
 Here, the governor's words come through.
 He said, "I can't set you free, it's not up to me, but there's much, Joe Bean,
 I'll do, I'll join your mother in extending Birthday greetings to you.
 Happy Birthday, Joe Bean."
 
 Alright. June! June Carter. Let's get June out here
 Let's get June Carter and the Tennessee Three back out right now
 
 Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month
 Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none
 He came home too drunk from mixin'Tanqueray and wine
 He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99
 
 Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop
 Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top
 When an off duty cop snuck up on him from behind
 Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99
 
 Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown
 He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down
 Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime
 Prison for ninety eight and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99
 
 A fistfight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away
 His mama stood up and shouted "Judge don't take my boy this way"
 Well son you got a statement you'd like to make
 Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away
 
 Now judge judge I had debts no honest man could pay
 The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they was takin' my house away
 Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man
 But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand
 
 Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead
 And if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head
 Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time
 And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that execution line
 
 You fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
 You fought all the way Johnny Reb
 
 Saw you a marchin' with Robert E Lee

 You fought for your folks but you didn't die in vain
 Even though you lost they speak highly of your name
 Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
 You fought all the way Johnny Reb
 
 I heard your teeth chatter from the cold outside
 Saw the bullets open up the wounds in your side
 I saw the young boys as they began to fall
 You had tears in your eyes cause you couldn't help at all
 But you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
 You fought all the way Johnny Reb
 
 I saw General Lee raise a sabre in his hand
 Heard the cannons roar as you made your last stand
 You marched into battle with the Grey and the Red
 When the cannon smoke cleared it took days to count the dead
 Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
 You fought all the way Johnny Reb
 
 When Honest Abe heard the news about your fall
 The folks thought he'd call a great victory ball
 But he asked the band to play the song Dixie
 For you Johnny Reb and all that you believed
 Cause you fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
 You fought all the way Johnny Reb
  You fought all the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb
 You fought all the way Johnny Reb
 You foughtall the way Johnny Reb Johnny Reb

 Maybe it's just about time I told you I'm all through with you
 But just about the time I start to tell you I start feeling blue
 And just about then I lose my nerve and wait another day or two
 'Cause just about the time I think it's over I start missing you
 
 It's just about time I had my sayin' I told you a thing or two
 It's just about time I paid you back you treat me like you do
 But just about the time I get the nerve I can't seem to carry through

 To Thee who's blood can cleanse each spot

 Oh lamb of God I come I come
 
 Put the bottle on the table let it stay there till I'm unable
 To see your face in every place that I go
 I've been sitting here too long just remembering that you are gone
 One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
 One drink just one more and then another
 I'll keep drinking it won't matter I'll just remember that I once had
 I don't know why I sat and cry every day
 I've been trying to forget but I haven't stopped it yet
 One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
 One drink just one more and then another
 
 Put the bottle on the table...
 
 I come from just the other side of nowhere
 To this big time lonesome town
 They got a lot of ice and snow here
 Half as cold as all the people I've found
 Every way I try to go here seems to bring me down
 I've seen about enough to know where I belong
 
 I've got a mind to see the headlights shining
 On that old white line between my heart and home
 Sick of spendin' Sundays wishing they were Mondays
 Sittin' in a park alone
 So give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me
 Any lovin' way but wrong
 Tell 'em that the pride of just the other side of nowhere's
 Goin' home
 
 Takin' nothin' back to show there
 For these dues I've paid
 But the soul I almost sold here
 And the body I've been givin' away
 Fadin' from the neon nighttime glow here
 Headin' for the light of day
 Just the other side of nowhere, goin' home
 
 I've got a mind to see the headlights shinin'
 On that old white line between my heart and home
 Sick of spendin' Sundays wishin' they were Mondays
 Sittin' in a park alone
 So give my best to anyone who's left who ever done me
 Any lovin' way but wrong
 Tell them that the pride of just the other side of nowhere's
 Goin' home
 Just the other side on nowhere, goin' home
 
 Well I saw you with another
 It made me lose my mind
 Shot you with my '38
 And now I'm doin' time
 And you put me here
 You put me here
 Well there's no way to doubt
 There ain't no two ways about it
 As sure as your name's Kate
 You put me here
 
 I've been tryin' to tell 'em
 That I didn't do no wrong
 Only gave you what you been
 Deservin' all along
 And you put me here
 You put me here
 There ain't no use denyin'
 You done it with your lyin'
 As sure as your name's Kate
 You put me here
 
 Well the jury found me guilty
 They wouldn't hear my plea
 I listened as that judge said
 Murder in the first degree
 And you put me here
 You put me here
 Well there ain't no need to doubt
 There ain't no two ways about it
 As sure as your name's Kate
 You put me here
 
 Now the warden and the preacher
 They're lettin' me go slow
 It won't be long until I'm gone
 Just thirteen steps to go
 And you put me here
 You put me here
 There's just one way to figure
 Your cheatin' pulled the trigger
 As sure as your name's Kate
 You put me here
 Well there ain't no need to doubt
 There ain't no two ways about it
 As sure as your name's Kate
 You put me here
 
 Kate, you just plain bad, you know that...
 
 I'm not the going steady kind
 I miss 'em all, all the time
 I told Annie I'd be true
 But I still think about Katy too
 
 Katy too, Katy too
 I still think about Katy too
 
 If you should see miss Mary-Ann
 Just tell her I'm her loving man
 Give my love to Jane and Sue
 But don't forget ol' Katy too
 
 I like Sadie's chicken stew
 And Suzie's good at stitchin' wool
 I like Mary's barbecue
 But I still like ol' Katy too
 
 Now, girls I'm not the flirty kind
 But I just can't make up my mind
 I'd like to marry all of you
 But I still miss ol' Katy too
 
 To all the girls I make this toast
 I love you everyone the most
 But don't ask me to say "I do"
 Cause I still miss ol' Katy too
 
 Cupid you bet you been good to me
 I got more girls than I can see
 But if you give me all but two
 Then let's squeeze in ol' Katy too
 
 Kaw-Liga
 Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standin' by the door
 He fell in love with an Indian maiden over in the antique store
 
 Kaw-Liga well he just stood there and never let it show
 So she could never answer yes or no
 
 Poor ol' Kaw-Liga well he never got a kiss
 Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed
 
 Is it any wonder that his face is red Kaw-Liga that poor ol' wooden head
 He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk
 The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
 
 Kaw-Liga well he stood there as lonely as can be
 'Cause his heart was an ol' pine knotty tree
 
 Poor ol' Kaw-Liga well he never got a kiss
 Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed
 
 And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid
 He took her oh so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed
 Well he stood there and never let it show so she could never answer yes or no
 
 Poor ol' Kaw-Liga well he never got a kiss
 Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed
 
 Well there's a dark and a troubled side of life.
 There's a bright and a sunny side too.
 But if you meet with the darkness and strife,
 The sunny side we also may view.
 
 Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side,
 Keep on the sunny side of life.
 It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way,
 If we keep on the sunny side of life.
 
 Oh, the storm and its fury broke today,
 Crushing hopes that we cherish so dear.
 Clouds and storms will in time pass away.
 The sun again will shine bright and clear.
 
 Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side,
 Keep on the sunny side of life.
 It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way,
 If we'll keep on the sunny side of life.
 
 Let us greet with a song of hope each day.
 Though the moments be cloudy or fair.
 Let us trust in our Saviour always,
 To keep us, every one, in His care.
 
 Keep on the sunny side, always on the sunny side,
 Keep on the sunny side of life.
 It will help us every day, it will brighten all the way,
 If we'll keep on the sunny side of life.
 
 If we'll keep on the sunny side of life
 
 You have gone and yet I'm still your prisoner
 Although you're with your new love I'm not free
 For you have placed a lock around my heart dear
 
 And you are the keeper of the key
 Love locked inside like mine burns constantly
 So darling please come back to me
 
 We'll lock our hearts together for a lifetime
 And God will be the keeper of the key
 Only you can break the chains that bind me
 Only you can end my misery
 
 No one else can dry the tears that blind me
 For you are the keeper of the key
 Love locked inside like mine
 
 Up in Kentucky they make a whiskey
 They call a Kentucky Straight Whiskey
 And up in Kentucky I married a woman
 That I bet she is a better woman
 Than that whiskey is whiskey
 I call her my Kentucky Straight
 
 I've rambled round the country side
 I've drifted near and far
 I've been off to seek my fortune
 I've been followin' every star
 I've rode the devil's highway
 The hell bound interstate
 But now I'm back at happy shack
 With my Kentucky Straight
 
 And we rise up every morning with the chicken
 And every minute we're alive we're livin'
 She's a little bit old fashioned but her lovin's up to date
 And I'm happy here with my Kentucky Straight
 
 I had looked for satisfaction in the arms of quite a few
 And I've done everything that I was big enough to do
 But everywhere I see her face from Maine to Golden Gate
 And I knew that this is where it's at with my Kentucky Straight
 
 And we rise up every morning with the chicken
 And every minute we're alive we're livin'
 I love her so she knows that it was worth a while to wait
 Cause I'm happy here with my kentucky straight
 
 Jesus said it has to be
 The Father planned My destiny
 This is My Blood which I must give
 I will die, so you may live
 
 He was a child, He was a son
 He was a man among men
 He was a friend, He was a Saint
 He was The King of Love
 
 Jesus died the world was dark
 Not a sound was there to hark
 The breath was gone, He hung His head 
 But wait, let us rejoice
 
 For He has risen from the dead
 He was a child, He was a son
 He was a man among men
 He was a friend, He was a Saint
 He was The King of Love
 
 If you gonna be king of the hill
 You can't make it at the cotton mill
 
 If you gonna be king of the hill
 You can't make it at the cotton mill
 Get put on at the Harlan mine
 Be the last one out at quittin' time
 
 You already workin' when the whistle blew
 Never complain about a job to do
 When they say who can, you say I will
 If you ever gonna be king of the hill
 
 If you gonna be king of the hill
 You can't make it at the cotton mill
 
 You need a good woman to share your bed
 To keep you loved and to keep you fed
 To help you to face another day
 To get you up and on your way
 
 Where the golden rule don't rule out true
 You do to them before they do to you
 Watch out for yourself or nobody will
 If you ever gonna be king of the hill
 
 If you gonna be king of the hill
 You can't make it at the cotton mill
 
 Saturday night you go to Harlan town
 You shoot some pool and you fool around
 You watch the girls and you drink bootleg
 Get starved to death before you beg
 
 You trust in luck till your luck is gone
 Then jump right in and you hang right on
 There may be times you would have to kill
 If you ever gonna be king of the hill
 
 If you gonna be king of the hill
 You can't make it at the cotton mill
 
 When the last of the coals out of every vein
 Had long been gone on the northbound train
 Walk up to the top and if you're standing still
 You can call yourself king of the hill
 
 But if you fall like a lot have done
 By accident or knife or gun
 When they lay you high on the mountain still
 You can call yourself king of the hill
 
 If you gonna be king of the hill
 You can't make it at the cotton mill
 
 
 Lady your arms're always warm and your bed was always ready when I came
 Lady in the middle of the night
 You would open up when you'd hear me call your name
 And you were always there to see the turning of my key
 And your laughing voice to me was like a song
 Lady your spirit's sweet and free it's hanging on with me now that I'm gone
 
 Lady you spoke softly and kind and you never had a word to criticize
 Lady you know I love you so even more than I ever let you be alive
 And day or night I knew that I could bring it all to you
 And if I was wrong you'd never put me down
 Lady so much I could say but I can't find the way to write it down
 Can't find the way to write it down
 
 The days and the miles roll by
 In Denver the Rambler and the Fisherman are tired of the road
 And ready for whatever the city and the night have to offer
 They check into a cheap hotel and go right to the bar downstairs
 It's Saturday night and the city's alive
 They've been in the bar four hours now and it's nearly closin' time
 
 Hey give me another Coors how about you Angie
 
 I don't like beer
 
 Wow man I believe the little lady here wants champagne
 
 Hey yeah could I have champagne
 
 Do you think we're a couple of bankers here or somethin'
 
 I like that
 
 Abracadabra abracadabra Coors you're no longer Coors you're champagne
 
 Man I've had enough of this
 
 Hey where are you goin'
 
 Good night
 
 Hey you're not goin' are you you were buyin' me a drink
 
 Hey give me another Coors
 
 But I don't like beer
 
 That ain't beer honey that's Coors
 
 Well the barman's right
 Beer the bar girls too much beer I must be seein' things
 I saw you sittin' on a barstool lady and I looked up and you were gone
 You didn't like beer either did you lady liked champagne neither did you lady
 In Denver Colorado fancy town for a fancy lady like you
 Hey maybe she's out there somewhere hey lady hahaha
 Hey I ran maybe she ran maybe I did see her downstairs
 Maybe she's drownin' her blues like I did
 Hey maybe I did see her down there havin' a ball somewhere comin' up to me
 Yeah maybe she'll be comin' yeah maybe she'll be comin'
 
 Last night I had the strangest dream I've ever known before
 I dreamed that all the world agreed to put an end to war
 I dreamed
 I saw a mighty room
 The room was filled with men
 And the papers
 They were signing said they'd never fight again.
 
 And when the papers
 Were all signed, and a million copies made, 
 They all shook hands and
 Bowed their heads and grateful prayers were prayed
 And the people
 In the streets below were dancing round and round
 While swords and
 Guns and uniforms lay scattered on the ground
 
 Last night I had the
 Strangest dream I've ever known before
 I dreamed that all the world
 Agreed to put an end to war
 
 Well my saddle's on my horse but I ain't goin' nowhere
 'Cause my ridin' days are over and there's vultures in the air
 Well the trails have been a brother and a devil all in one
 I'm gonna lay back with my woman throw away my fightin' guns
 Well I spent many lonely evenings listenin' to the howl of the wolfe
 Talk about her like a loved one did you ever kiss a horses' hoof
 They keep puttin' up all them fences to section up the country mile
 I'm gonna lay back with my woman and take it easy for a while
 
 Yes there's danger on the prairie there's rattlesnakes that bite
 In every little town you come to there's always a good old fight
 Well there's nothin' like his and her place I wouldn't say it if I didn't know
 I'm gonna lay back with my woman and love her sweet country soul
 Well you see her arms are ready and the kitchen's full of food
 She's got a smile that's pretty but then it all looks kinda good
 Can you blame a guy for thinkin' he'd be crazy to hit the trail
 I'm gonna lay back with my woman and put my horses up for sale
 I'm gonna lay back with my woman put my horses up for sale
 
 When my hands are tired and my step is slow 
 Walk beside me and give me the strength to go 
 Fill my face with your courage so defeat won't show 
 Pick me up when I stumble so the world won't know 
 Lead me Father with the staff of life give me the strength for a song 
 That the words I sing might more strength bring 
 To help some poor troubled weary worker along 
 When my way is light but I still can see 
 With a strong hand strike out the blindness in me 
 Show me work that I should carry on for Thee 
 Make my way straight and narrow like you wanted to be 
 Lead me Father
 
 Oh lead me gently home father lead me gently home
 When life's toils are ended and parting days have come
 Sin no more will tempt me there from Thee I'll roam
 If you'll only lead me father lead me gently home
 Oh lead me gently home father lead me gently home
 If I fall upon the wayside lead me gently home
 Lead me gently home father lead me gently home
 If life's darkest hours father when my troubles come
 Keep my feet from wandering there from Thee I'll roam
 Lest I fall upon the wayside lead me gently home
 Oh lead me gently home
 
 Well, you come home feeling for the knob on the door
 You better pick up your feet, you're gonna fall on the floor
 I keep on telling you, I'll tell you some more
 You better leave that junk alone and drink water
 
 Lord, that liquor is hot, drink water
 You don't wanna be a sot
 You better lay down the bottle
 And put on the top and drink cool H2O
 
 Well, your eyes are baggy and a bloodshot red
 It's been a week or two since you've been in bed
 You better pay attention now to what I said
 You better leave that junk alone and drink water
 
 Lord, that liquor is hot, drink water
 You don't wanna be a sot
 You better lay down the bottle
 And put on the top and drink cool H2O
 
 Well, now I'll forgive you for your running around
 If you just promise that you come unwound
 I'll buy you anything you want in town
 If you'll leave that junk alone and drink water
 
 Lord, that liquor is hot, drink water
 You don't wanna be a sot
 You better lay down the bottle
 And put on the top and drink cool H2O
 
 Let me down easy if you must go why not deceive me it won't hurt me so 
 Truth is so painful tell me a lie let me down easy and I'll get by 
 Let me down easy for old time's sake 
 Is it too much to ask when my heart's gonna break 
 I'm bound to lose you I'm bound to cry oh let me down easy and I'll get by 
 
 Let me down easy
 
 Brightly beams our Father's mercy from his lighthouse evermore
 But to us he gives the keeping of the lights along the shore
 
 Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
 Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save
 
 Dark the night of sin has settled loud the angry billows roar
 Eager eyes are watching longing for the lights along the shore
 
 Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
 Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save
 
 Trim your feeble lamp my brother, some poor sailor tempest tossed
 Trying now to make the harbor in the darkness may be lost
 
 Let the lower lights be burning, send a gleam across the wave
 Some poor fainting struggling seaman, you may rescue you may save
 
 I don't want no aggravation
 When my train has left the station
 If you're there or not, I may not even know
 Have a round and remember
 Things we did that weren't so tender
 Let the train blow the whistle when I go
 
 On my old guitar sell tickets
 So someone can finally pick it
 And tell the girls down at the Ritz I said hello
 Tell the gossipers and liars
 I will see them in the fire
 Let the train blow the whistle when I go
 
 Let her blow, let her blow
 Long and loud and hard and happy
 Let her blow
 No regrets, all my debts will be paid
 When I get laid
 Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
 
 You'll be left without excuses
 For the evils and abuses
 Down today from years and years ago
 And have yourself another toke
 From my basket full of smoke
 And let the train blow the whistle when I go
 
 Let her blow, let her blow
 Long and loud and hard and happy
 Let her blow
 No regrets, all my debts will be paid
 When I get laid
 Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
 Let her blow, let her blow, let her blow
 
 Tom T Hall is forty now and so is Bobby Bare
 Willie Nelson's gettin' grey and Faron Young don't care
 But the young ones keep on coming on the old are slow to go
 Let there be country and let the country grow
 Let there be country let the music roll along
 Let there be country and let me share the song
 
 No one picks like Bill Monroe and don't George Jones sing great
 I can tell that the people care by the people at my gate
 Webb Pierce invites the tourists in and Ray keeps them away
 Let there be country and let the country play
 Let there be country
 
 Ernest Tubb's got all of the soul he's had for all these years
 Porter Wagoner's recitation still bring me to tears
 And when they do play Kitty Wells you know she's still the Queen
 Let there be country and keep the country green
 Let there be country
 
 Little Jimmy Dickens still sends shivers through the crowd
 Mother Maybelle whispers now but the heart comes through real loud
 Gene Autry don't sing no more good old Tex Ritter's gone
 And somewhere downtown Nashville a young man just got off the bus
 With a guitar in his hands a pocket full of songs
 A lot of talent and a heart full of hope
 And he's gonna be the next big country star and the country wheels roll on
 Let there be country
 Let there be country
 
 A cowpoke rode in, one hot dusty day
 To a store down in old San Antone
 He stood at the window and I heard him say
 Do I have a letter from home
 
 The postmaster looked through the mail that had come
 Then smilingly shook his gray head
 The cowpoke looked sadly a moment at him
 And these are the words that he said
 
 No letter from home, no letter from home
 There's never a letter from home
 No message from mother or none of the others
 There's never a letter from home
 
 That night he was shot on the wrong side of town
 No more of those plains will he roam
 I reached for my Bible and gave it to him
 And said, "Son here's your letter from home"
 
 "If only I had just a little more time
 To read it", the young cowpoke said
 "I can't take it with me and I must go on"
 Then he died with his letter unread
 
 The letter from home, the letter from home
 No time for the letter from home
 The cowboy laid dead with his letter unread
 Too late for the letter from home
 
 My baby left me just the other day
 I guess the things will never be the same
 But I must forget that she is gone
 Cause time goes by and life goes on
 
 Making plans, shaking hands
 Try to prove that I'm a man
 It's hard to do but I must try
 Cause life goes on and so will I
 
 It's been kinda tough these last few days
 Trying to act normal and be gay
 It's not easy to be all alone
 But time goes by and life goes on
 
 If I see her anywhere
 I hope she thinks that I don't care
 For after night there comes the dawn
 Yes time goes by and life goes on
 
 He drinks a cup of coffee and way before the sun he's up and goin'
 Out on a work detail cause he knows soon the morning whistle will begin to blowin'
 All day out in that hot sun with no reward for any work he'll do
 And then he'll come back in the evening
 And dreams a lot of dreams that can't come true
 
 This is the life of a prisoner forgotten man that's there to stay
 He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday
 
 Well no one cares about him or it seems at way to him as time goes by
 One day is like the other and every time he prays he prays to die
 He's been there for so long now he wouldn't know how to talk to men outside
 And though it's the life he lives for he fears the day the gates swing open wide
 
 This is the life of a prisoner...
 He lives on faith and hope and courage and a few old dreams of yesterday
 
 Life is like a mountain railway
 With an engineer that's brave
 We must make the run successful
 From the cradle to the grave
 
 Heed the curves and watch the tunnels
 Never falter, never fail
 Keep your hand upon the throttle
 And your eye upon the rail
 
 Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
 Till we reach that blissful shore
 Where the angels wait to join us
 In that train forevermore
 
 Oh, Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
 Till we reach that blissful shore
 Where the angels wait to join us
 In God's grace forevermore
 
 Oh, the lights of Magdala flicker dimly on the shore
 Holy sailor sailing on the sea
 Patiently waiting she walks quietly to the door
 Another lonely night in Galilee
 
 Magdalene, don't wrap your dreams in sorrow
 Save them for tomorrow if it comes
 When we'll meet within a circle round the sun
 If heaven were a lady don't you know you'd have been the one
 
 To the streets of Jerusalem you followed him once more
 Your holy sailor's come home from the sea
 The somewhere someone's calling him to a distant golden shore
 Far from the lonely nights in Galilee
 
 Magdalene, don't wrap your dreams in sorrow
 Save them for tomorrow if it comes
 When we'll meet within a circle round the sun
 If heaven were a lady I know you'd been the one
 
 With the twilight colors falling
 And the evening laying shadows
 Hidden memories come stealing from my mind
 And I feel my own heart beating out
 The simple joy of living
 And I wonder how I ever was that kind
 
 But the wild road I was rambling
 Was always out there calling
 And you said a hundred times I should have died
 Then you reached down and touched me 
 And I lifted me up with you 
 So, I believe it was a road that I was meant to ride
 
 I'm like a soldier getting over the war
 I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
 Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
 I don't have to do that anymore
 I'm like a soldier getting over the war
 
 There are nights I don't remember
 And pain that it's been forgotten
 And a lot of things I choose not to recall
 There are faces that come to me
 In my darkest secret memories
 Faces that I wish would not come back at all
 
 But in my dreams parade of lovers 
 From the other times and places
 There's not one that matters now, no matter who
 I'm just thankful for the journey
 And that I've survived the battles
 And that's my spoils of victory is you
 
 I'm like a soldier getting over the war
 I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
 Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
 Everyday gets betther than the day before
 I'm like a soldier getting over the war
 
 It should be a while before I see doctor Death
 So, it would sure would be nice if I could get my breath
 Well, I'm not the cryin', nor the whinin' kind
 Til I hear the whistle of the 309, of the 309, of the 309
 Put me in my box on the 309
 
 Take me to the depot, put me to bed
 Blow an electric fan on my gnarly ol' head
 Everybody take a look, see, I'm doin' fine
 Then load my box on the 309
 On the 309, on the 309
 Put me in my box on the 309
 
 Hey, sweet baby, kiss me hard
 Draw my bath water, sweep my yard
 Give a drink of my wine to my jersey cow
 I wouldn't give a hoot-and-nail for my journey now
 On the 309, on the 309
 
 I hear the sound of a railroad train
 The whistle blows and I'm gone again
 Hitman, take me higher than a Georgia pine
 Stand back children, it's the 309
 It's the 309, it's the 309
 Put me in my box on the 309
 
 A chicken in the pot and turkey in the corn
 Ain't felt this good since Jubilee morn'
 Talk about luck, well, I got mine
 Asthma comin' down like the 309
 
 Write me a letter, sing me a song
 Tell me all about it, what I did wrong
 Meanwhile, I will be doin' fine
 Then load my box on the 309
 On the 309, on the 309
 Gonna get outta here on the 309
 
 There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
 Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
 There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
 Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
 
 Oh, the water is cool and the water is blue
 A drink for me and a drink for you
 Yes, the water is cool and the water is blue
 A drink for me and a drink for you
 
 There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
 Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
 There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
 Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
 
 Oh, the water is cool and the water is deep
 Take off our shoes and cool our feet
 Yes, the water is cool and the water is deep
 Take off our shoes and cool our feet
 
 There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
 Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
 There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
 Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
 
 Come along with me to the pasture now
 We'll watch the wind blow on the cows
 Come along with me to the pasture now
 We'll watch the wind blow on the cows
 
 There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
 Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
 There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
 Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
 
 There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
 Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
 There's a little green fountain on a little green mountain
 Don't you think we ought to stop and get a drink of water
 
 I wish I had a pair of little magic glasses
 That I could see the future just by lookin' through
 Then I could know what road tomorrow's gonna take me down
 And I could see if I'll be walkin' down that road with you
 
 I would keep my little magic glasses hidden
 I would let nobody else see what I see
 And everyone would want to know how I can know what lies ahead
 And they'll wonder when I say tomorrow I see you with me
 
 But if I see into the future that I'm on the road alone
 And where the way was sunny, now there's only rain
 
 I'll put them in a box and seal it with a lock
 And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
 I will put them in a box and seal it with a lock
 And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
 And I'll never take my little magic glasses out again
 
 Was it bitter then with our backs against the wall?
 Were we better men than we'd ever been before?
 Say, if she came again today, would you still answer to the call?
 Tell the truth, my friend, don't it matter anymore?
 We were simple men by her side when she was born
 It was simple then like the freedom when you fall
 And we were smaller then, you see, but soon we gathered like a storm.
 They don't understand what that thunder meant at all.
 Was he crucified? Was he done in by the lawman?
 Are you satisfied that he'll never ride again?
 Some people say he got away; they say he never died at all.
 If that story's true, does it bother you, my friend?
 Was it bitter then, with our backs against the wall?
 Were we better men than we'd ever been before?
 Say, if she came again today, would you still answer to the call?
 Tell the truth, my friend, don't it matter anymore?
 
 Since you've been gone,
 I've been walking around
 With my head bowed down to my shoes.
 I've been living the blues
 Ev'ry night without you.
 
 I don't have to go far
 To know where you are,
 Strangers all give me the news.
 I've been living the blues
 Ev'ry night without you.
 
 I think that it's best,
 I soon get some rest
 And forget my pride.
 But I can't deny
 This feeling that I
 Carry for you deep down inside.
 
 If you see me this way,
 You'd come back and you'd stay,
 Oh, how could you refuse.
 I've been living the blues
 Ev'ry night without you.
 
 My pappy said when I was seventeen you're six feet tall and your face is clean
 And it don't look right for a boy that old to not make a livin' loadin' coal
 Loadin' coal loadin' coal I'm a double first cousin to a dad blamed mole
 Never get rich for to save my soul and forty 'leven years a loadin' coal loadin' coal
 Ain't never got acquainted with a dollar bill and I don't ever reckon that I ever will
 A dollar ain't made for a fellar I'm told that scoops up a livin' loadin' coal
 Loadin' coal loadin' coal...
 
 I cussed everything in the mining camp from a shovel and my pick to my carbide lamp
 But I know mighty well till I grow old I'll still be a cussin' but loadin' coal
 Loadin' coal loadin' coal...
 
 I know just as well as coal is black one of these days the mines were strike
 And I'll sit around starvin' till I'm finally told
 There's a nickel more a ton for loadin' coal
 Loadin' coal loadin' coal...
 
 On the park bench I slept on raindrops are fallin' on the newspapers coverin' me
 I hear early morning motors and I know the world is waking for the dawn
 But my mind's down in dark alley somewhere where last night you loved me
 And in the early morning chill my arms remember still
 But I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone
 
 The sun is roughly rising on the roofs of stagger town
 The time for sweatin' poison out is just now comin' round
 The high time of last midnight is over with and gone
 Leaving me lonesome to the bone
 
 I walked away the wind blows and any way the wind goes will be good enough for me
 The streets are loud and crowded but I walk my weary way lost and alone
 Your hot breath and your laughter keep flashing through my mind to warm me
 But the naked light of day soon makes it fade away
 And I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone
 
 The sun is roughly rising
 
 Well I'm gonna start out walkin'
 Just you wait and see
 Uh Uh guitar picker
 You ain't leavin' without me
 
 Oh you big mouthed woman
 You long-legged guitar pickin' man
 Well, we can work this out
 Uh huh, yes mam, I think we can
 
 Well I stole the Hope diamond
 hopin' I could shut your mouth 
 But how am I gonna wear it
 if I got to hide it out 
 
 Oh you big mouthed woman
 You long-legged guitar pickin' man
 But we can work this out
 Uh huh, yes mam, I think we can
 
 Well I bought you a first class ticket
 For a luxury liner cruise
 I got out in that ocean
 Looked around and there was you
 
 Oh you big mouthed woman
 You long-legged guitar pickin' man
 But we can work this out
 Uh huh, yes mam, I think we can
 
 I bought you a big long limosine
 But I don't want no car
 I need my lovin' everything
 But you're still what you are
 
 You're just a big mouthed woman
 You're a long-legged guitar pickin' man
 But we can work this out
 Uh huh, yes mam, I think we can
 
 This time last year there sure was
 A lot of sad faces around this old house
 Our papa died without fulfillin' his life's dream
 Of producing one of the best crops in Grimes County
 
 Though papa died with that dream still in his head
 A desire in his heart, a promise on his lips, calluses on both hands
 And two dollars in his pocket
 Papa didn't live long enough to see his dreams come true
 
 So he died from too much work, broken spirit, I guess
 But I promised our mama that if it was a last thing he'd ever do
 He'd live long enough to see just one good crop come through
 But you see we can't plan on things without first talking to God
 
 Because we don't know his plans
 And if we don't include him my friends the way can get mighty hard
 They say that every time a good and righteous person
 Is buried in God's good earth it's just fertilizer for the soil
 
 And I guess there must be some truth to that
 Whether we believe it or not
 I just wish that papa was here right now
 So that he could see this good crop that we finally got
 
 Hey look at that beans and look at that corn
 And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
 Man look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
 Well I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased
 
 And papa would sure be proud of his children too
 My brother's famous now got his own show on the road
 Traveling in customized bus imported from Europe
 That boy always did love music and he loves to travel
 
 I got a sister that's got a good job in a beauty shop
 Making money, making other people look good
 Ain't nobody here at a house now but me and mama
 And mama she's gettin' weaker and she's gettin' older every day
 
 And she talks softly about joinin' papa in his heavenly home
 But that woman sure did love that man
 She worked beside papa for forty some odd years
 Tryin' to produce a good crop and never could grow a single bean
 
 But I just wish that papa was here right now
 To see this good crop that we finally got
 Man, look at that beans and look at that corn
 And I bet them watermelons must be three feet long
 
 Man, look at them tomatoes and look at them peas
 Well, I know if papa was here right now he'd sure be pleased
 And papa, if you can hear me look at them beans
 
 
 The teacher of truth told tales
 Of trouble times that would begin
 And the cynical sower sowed
 The sorrowful seeds of seven sins
 The people placed a price upon
 The prince of perfect peace
 And the one who wooed the world was wounded
 Look unto the east
 
 The morning moved in mournfully
 With many moments marred
 By brawny beast who beat the beauty
 Bound and bit and barred
 They laid the lash upon him low
 His lips moved not the least
 Watch him come from where he did go
 Look unto the east
 
 The devil drew his darts
 And the dearest dove came droppin' down
 But the spirits slips in soft and sweetly
 Unseen with no sound
 The comforter, the counselor
 With us till time is ceased
 And the groom will return for his bride
 Look unto the east
 
 A cold bitter mist covers your eyes torment is raging in you
 But you can't change the smallest part of all the wrongs you've done
 Looking back in anger like you do
 
 I'm not preachin' I'm just talkin' but I believe in what I say
 That look of anger that you keep flashin' won't accomplish you anything today
 Reach out your hand someone will take it
 Someone took mine then I saw a different view
 I saw it'd take take a lot more loving
 And a lot less looking back in anger like you do
 
 You're still a victim of the pornographic past
 The smutty face of evil showing through
 But you can't take away the scars that you put on that face
 Looking back in anger like you do
 
 Now I ain't preachin'...
 
 Lord ' Lord ' Lord, is there a place for me
 In the scheme of things, in the service of the King
 Lord ' Lord ' Lord, there is no job too great
 As I grow in faith, there's no job too great

 The years creep slowly by Lorena
 Snow is on the grass again
 The sun is sinking, Lorena
 Frost is where the flowers have been
 
 The music's sad and low, Lorena
 Happy sounds have left the day
 The banjos softly play, Lorena
 Where once they rang so loud and gay
 
 I hardly feel the cold, Lorena
 I pray this darkness soon will pass
 We'll sing those songs again, Lorena
 You'll be in my arms at last
 
 A burnin' hot sun a cryin' for water black wings circle the sky 
 Stumblin' and fallin' somebody's callin' you're lost on the desert to die 
 I had to give up and they took me to jail but I hid all the money I got 
 Way out on the desert where no one could get it and I left a mark at the spot 
 Then I got away and I ran for the desert the devil had taken control 
 I needed water but he said I'd make it near the money is a big waterhole 
 A burnin' hot sun... 
  
 Just up ahead is where I left my mark or it may be to the left or the right 
 I've been runnin' all day and they'll catch up tomorrow I've got to find it tonight 
 Then up jumped the devil and ran away laughin' he drank all the waterholes dry 
 He moved my mark till I'm running in circles and lost on the desert to die 
 A burnin' hot sun... 
  lost on the desert to die 
 
 Well, at birth mom and papa called their little boy Ned
 Raised him on the banks of a river bed
 On a houseboat tied to a big tall tree
 A home for my papa and my mama and me
 
 The clock strikes three and papa jumps to his feet
 Already mama's cooking papa something to eat
 At half past, papa he's ready to go
 He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou
 
 He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
 Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
 He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
 He's gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
 Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
 
 My Muskrat hides hanging by the dozens
 Even got a lady mink, a muskrat's cousin
 Got 'em out drying in the hot, hot sun
 Tomorrow papa's gonna turn 'em into money
 
 Well, they call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
 Little baby brother on the floor that's Mack
 Bren and Lin are the family twins
 And big brother Ed's on the bayou fishing
 
 On the river floats papa's great big boat
 And that's how my papa goes into town
 Takes him every bit of a night and a day
 To even reach a place where the people stay
 
 And I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
 That's the day my papa takes his furs to town
 Papa promised me that I could go
 He'd even let me see a cowboy show
 
 I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time then
 I told my pop I've gotta go again
 Well, Papa said, "Son we've got lines to run
 We'll come back again but first there's work to be done"
 
 He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
 Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
 He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
 Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
 Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
 
 Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
 Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
 Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
 
 I guess we're over and it's all been said before
 But I still want you though there's no reason anymore
 I can't remember when you and I began
 It makes no difference cause love has lost again
 
 If there's a reason we forgot it long ago
 And if there's an answer it's one I'll never know
 The price of giving I just don't understand but it's collected and love has lost again
 
 All that's left now is the closing of the door
 It sounds so final but I don't listen anymore
 It's not the last time that I'll break instead of bend
 But for the moment love has lost again
 It's not the last time.
 
 I have been a rover
 I have walked alone
 Hiked a hundred highways
 Never found a home
 Still in all I'm happy
 The reason is, you see
 Once in a while along the way
 Love's been good to me
 
 There was a girl in Denver
 Before the summer storm
 Oh, her eyes were tender
 Oh, her arms were warm
 And she could smile away the thunder
 Kiss away the rain
 Even though she's gone away
 You won't hear me complain
 
 There was a girl in Portland
 Before the winter chill
 We used to go a-courtin'
 Along October hill
 And she could laugh away the dark clouds
 Cry away the snow
 It seems like only yesterday
 As down the road I go
 
 I have been a rover
 I have walked alone
 Hiked a hundred highways
 Never found a home
 Still in all I'm happy
 The reason is, you see

 Love's been good to me

 As down the road I go
 
 I got a feelin' called the blues, oh, Lord
 Since my baby said goodbye
 Lord, I don't know what I'll do
 All I do is sit and sigh, oh, Lord
 
 That last long day she said goodbye
 Well, Lord, I thought I would cry
 She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'
 Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
 
 Such a beautiful dream
 I hate to think it all over, I've lost my heart it seems
 I've grown so used to you somehow
 Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
 And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues
 
 Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
 That's what's the matter with me
 Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
 But she don't care about me
 
 Lord, I tried and I tried, to keep her satisfied
 But she just wouldn't stay
 So now that she is leavin'
 This is all I can say
 
 I got a feelin' called the blues, oh, Lord
 Since my baby said goodbye
 Lord, I don't know what I'll do
 All I do is sit and sigh, oh, Lord
 
 That last long day she said goodbye
 Well, Lord, I thought I would cry
 She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'

 I hate to think it all over, I've lost my heart it seems
 I've grown so used to you somehow
 Lord, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
 And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues
 
 I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
 Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
 Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
 Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
 Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 Coming close together
 With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
 She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
 I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
 But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
 Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
 Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
 Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I"ve been
 Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
 Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
 
 I lived on a farm out in Iowa I pulled the corn and I worked in the hay 
 Got trapped by a girl but I wiggled free heard the Oregon timber callin' me 
 Will you tell me somethin' Mr Lumberjack is it one for forward and three for back 
 Is it two for stop or four for go boy ask a whistle punk I don't know 
 
 Well I learned this fact from a logger named Ray you don't cut timber on a windy day 
 Stay out of the woods when the moisture's low 
 Or you ain't gonna live to collect your doe 
 Will you tell me somethin'... 
 
 Well you work in the woods from morning till night 
 You laugh and sing and you cuss and fight 
 On Saturday night you go to Eugene's and on a Sunday morning your pockets are clean 
 Will you tell me somethin'...
 
 We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band with a plain ol' country style
 We never played the kind of songs that'd drive anybody wild
 Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
 We played a blues song, kinda slow and sweet
 But the thing that knocked them off of their feet was, ooh-wee
 
 When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
 Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
 Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
 Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie in the strangest kind of way
 
 Play it strange
 
 Well, we did our best to entertain everywhere we'd go
 We'd nearly wear our fingers off to give the folks a show
 Played jumping jive to make 'em get in the groove
 We played sad songs, real slow and smooth
 But the only thing that'd make 'em move was, ooh-wee
 
 When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
 Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
 Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
 Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie in the strangest kind of way
 Now damn Luther play the boogie straight

 When you wake up in the morning baby, look inside your mirror
 I won't be next to you
 You know I won't be near
 I'd be curious to know if your reflection is as clear
 As the one that I've got on my mind
 Mama you been on my mind
 
 Well perhaps it's the wind
 And the dark dark night that's covering
 The crossroads that I'm at
 And maybe it's the weather or somethin' like that
 But mama, you been on my mind
 Mama, you been on my mind
 
 Well I don't need trouble please don't put me down, don't get upset
 I am not pleading I won't say I'll forget
 And I won't pace a floor bowed down and bent, but yet
 Mama you been on my mind
 Mama you been on my mind
 
 Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts are kinda narrow
 Where you been don't bother me
 Or bring me down with sorrow
 It don't matter to me where you'll be waking up tomorrow
 But mama you been on my mind
 Mama you been on my mind
 
 Well, you wonder why I always dress in black,
 Why you never see bright colors on my back,
 And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.
 Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.
 
 I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
 Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town,
 I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,
 But is there because he's a victim of the times.
 
 I wear the black for those who never read,
 Or listened to the words that Jesus said,
 About the road to happiness through love and charity,
 Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.
 
 Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose,
 In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
 But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,
 Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.
 
 I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
 For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,
 I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,
 Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.
 
 And, I wear it for the thousands who have died,
 Believen' that the Lord was on their side,
 I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
 Believen' that we all were on their side.
 
 Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
 And things need changin' everywhere you go,
 But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,
 You'll never see me wear a suit of white.
 
 Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
 And tell the world that everything's OK,
 But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,
 'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black
 
 I studied at the feet of a master
 Gamaliel we called him, the beauty of the law
 I was born of the tribe of Benjamin, I was a pharisee
 And I could quote from memory the holy Torah
 
 That day that the Nazarene was brought to trial
 It was on a sabbath eve, there was a earthquake when he died
 Just another passing preacher who came up from Galilee
 Blaspheming trouble-maker, we let him be crucified
 
 Then I thought that I would hear no more about him
 But his friends found his tomb empty
 Claimed that he rose from the dead
 Then they said he walked among them
 With the nail wounds in his hands
 That king upon a donkey with a thorn crown on his head
 
 His followers kept growing in great number
 And the one that they call Caiaphas mocked us in the judgment hall
 And with the Greek name Stephen, we knew the gentiles had come in
 I cast my vote against him, he was stoned I saw him fall
 
 Then the friends of the Nazarene became united
 And I became enraged then led a slaughter zealously
 I found their secret places, they were beaten, they were chained
 But some of them were scattered, justified in fearing me
 
 Then the man in white, appeared to me
 In such a blinding light it struck me down
 With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the man in white
 In gentle loving tone spoke to me
 And I was blinded so that I might see, the man in white
 
 But like the wind that blows the scattered sea
 From Alexandria to Antioch their congregation grew
 I went to the high priest for letters of permission
 To go to other cities, to see my mission through
 
 Six days on the hot road to the masters
 And just outside the city in the middle of the day
 A great unearthly light struck and overpowered me
 Prostrate on the hot road, I was blinded were I laid
 
 Then I thought I heard the rushing of great water
 And a multitude of angels singing sweet and heavenly
 And through the sound of wind, came a voice so soft and kind
 Meant for only me to hear, "saul, why do you persecute me?"
 
 As I lay there on the ground, in my blindness
 He asked me once again, and suddenly the voice I knew
 So finally I managed, a trembling response
 Who are you lord? I asked him, but I already knew
 
 I am Jesus of Nazareth the voice answered
 Arise go to Damascus on the street called straight will be
 A place where you will wait for my servant Ananias
 He will open up your eyes, you'll be a witness unto me
 
 So now I live to serve my master
 As zealous in his service as I once was as his foe
 And keeping his commandments given on Damascus road
 I go to all the world, and I let the whole world know
 
 Then the man in white, appeared to me
 In such a blinding light it struck me down
 With it's brilliance, took away my sight, then the man in white
 In gentle loving tone spoke to me
 And I was blinded so that I might see, the man in white
 And I was blinded so that I might see, the man in white
 The man in white
 
 It was on one cold winter night
 When the wind blew across the wild moor
 When Mary came wandering home with a child
 Till she came to her own father's door
 "Father, dear father," she cried
 "Come down and open the door
 Or the child in my arms will perish and die
 From the winds that blow across the wild moor."
 
 But her father was deaf to her cry
 Not a sound of a voice did he hear
 So the watchdog did howl and the village bells tolled
 And the wind blew across the wild moor
 
 Oh, how the old man must have felt
 When he came to the door the next morn'
 And he found Mary dead but the child still alive
 Closely grasping its dead mother's arms
 
 In grief, the old man passed away
 And the child, to it's mother, went soon
 And no one, they say, lives there to this day
 And the cottage, to ruin, has gone
 
 But the villagers point out the spot
 Where the willows grew over the door
 Saying, "There Mary died, once the gay village bride
 From the wind that blow across the wild moor
 
 I heard on the radio there's rumors of war
 People gettin' ready for battle and there may be just one more
 I heard about an earthquake and the toll it took away
 These are the signs of the times we're in today
 
 Matthew 24 is knocking at the door
 And there can't be too much more to come to past 
 Matthew 24 is knockin' at the door and today or one day more could be the last
 
 The great bear from the Northland has risen from his sleep
 And the army ranks in red are near two hundred million deep
 The young and old now prophesy a coming prince of peace
 And last night I dreamed of lightening in the East
 
 Matthew 24 is knocking at the door...
 
 Busted flat in Baton Rouge
 Waitin' for the train
 Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
 Bobby thumbed a diesel down
 Just before it rained
 Rode us all the way to New Orleans
 I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
 And was playing soft
 While Bobby sang the blues
 With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
 I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
 We sang every song that driver knew
 Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
 Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
 Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
 When he sang the blues
 And feelin' good was good enough for me
 Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
 From Kentucky coal mines
 To the California sun
 Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
 Through all kinds of weather, Lord
 Through everything I done
 Bobby baby kept me from the cold
 Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
 I let him slip away
 Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
 And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
 For one single yesterday
 Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
 Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
 Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
 Feelin good was easy, Lord
 When he sang the blues
 And buddy, that was good enough for me
 Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
 It's been rough and rocky travelin' 
 But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
 After takin' several readings I'm surprised 
 To find my mind's still fairly sound
 
 I guess Nashville was the roughest 
 But I know I've said the same about them all
 We've received our education 
 In the cities of the nation, me and Paul
 
 Almost busted in Laredo but for reasons 
 That I'd rather not disclose
 But if you're stayin' in a motel there and leave
 Just don't leave nothin' in your clothes
 
 And at the airport in Milwaukee 
 They refused to let us board the plane at all
 They said we looked suspicious 
 But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul
 
 It's been rough and rocky travelin' 
 But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
 After takin' several readings I'm surprised 
 To find my mind's still fairly sound
 
 On a package show in Buffalo with us 
 And Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride
 The show was long and we're just sittin' there
 And we'd come to play and not just for the ride
 
 Well we drank a lot of whiskey so I don't know 
 If we went on that night at all
 I don't think they even missed us 
 I guess Buffalo ain't geared for me and Paul
 
 It's been rough and rocky travelin' 
 But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
 After takin' several readings I'm surprised 
 To find my mind's still fairly sound
 
 The devil in hell, we're told was chained
 A thousand years he there remained
 He neither complain nor did he groan but
 Was determined to start a hell of his own
 
 Where he could torment the souls of men
 Without being chained in a prison pen
 So he asked the lord if he had on hand
 Anything left when he made this land
 
 The Lord said yes, there's a plenty on hand
 But I left it down by the Rio Grande
 The fact is ol' boy, the stuff is so poor
 I don't think you could use it as the hell anymore
 
 But the devil went down to look at the truck
 And said if he took it as a gift he was stuck
 For after lookin' that over carefully and well
 He said this place is too dry for hell
 
 But in order to get it off his hands
 The Lord promised the devil to water the land
 So trade was closed and deed was given
 And the Lord went back to his home in heaven
 
 And the devil said, now I got all what's needed
 To make a good hell and he succeeded
 He began by putting thorns all over the trees
 He mixed up the sand with millions of fleas
 
 He scattered tarantulas along the road
 Put thorns on cactus and horns on toads
 Lengthened the horns of the Texas steer
 Put an addition to the rabbit's ear
 
 Put a little devil in the bronco steed
 And poisoned the feet of the centipede
 The rattlesnake bites you, the scorpion stings
 The mosquito delights you with his buzzing wings
 
 The sunbursts are there and so the ants
 And if you sit down
 You'll need to have soles on your pants
 The wild boar rooms on a high chapparel
 
 It's a hell of a place that he has for hell
 The heat in the summers are hundred and ten
 Too hot for the devil, too hot for men
 The red pepper grows upon the banks of the brook
 
 The Mexican use it in all that he cook
 Just dine in with one of 'em and you're bound to shout
 I've hell on the inside as well as it out
 My hands are calloused July to July
 
 I use a Big Dipper to navigate by
 Fight off the wolves who drink from my well
 So I have to be mean as hell
 A sheep-herder came and put up the fence
 
 I saw him one day but I ain't seen him since
 But if you need a mutton we got mutton to sell
 We're cowpunchers and we're mean as hell
 Neither me nor my pony's got a pedigree
 
 But he takes me where I'm wantin' to be
 I'll ride him to death and when he has fell
 I'll get me another one mean as hell
 I shot me a calf and I cut off her head
 
 'Cause the boys in the bunkhouse are waitin' to be fed
 They rise in chime with the five thirty bell
 And the best one of any of 'em is mean as hell
 
 I give my woman half my money at the general store I said, "Now buy a little groceries, and don't spend no more." But she gave ten dollars for a ten cent hat And bought some store bought cat food for a mean eyed cat.
 
 When I give her ten more dollars for a one way ticket She was mad as she could be Then I bet ten more that if she ever left She'd come a-crawlin' back to me When I woke up this mornin' and I turned my head There wasn't a cotton pickin' thing on her side of the bed I found a little old note where her head belonged It said, "Dear John, honey, baby, I'm long gone."
 
 When I heard a whistle blowin', and the big wheels a-turnin' I was scared as I could be I put on my overalls and I headed to town Gonna bring her back with me.
 
 I asked the man down at the station if he'd seen her there I told him all about her pretty eyes and long, blonde hair He spit his tobacco, said, "I'll be dad blamed...... I believe I did see her leavin' on the east bound train."
 
 I bought a round trip ticket on the east bound train I was broke as I could be But when I come back, gotta buy another ticket Gotta bring her back with me.
 
 Well, I got off the train somewhere in Arkansas And I worked up the guts to call my Mother-In-Law She said, "I'll tell you where she is, if you act right." "She's workin' four to twelve at Trucker's World tonight."
 
 When I walked in she saw me, and she took off her apron And she grabbed her goin' home hat She bought a ticket with her tips And now we're curled up on the sofa, me and her....and that mean eyed cat
 
 We saw houses falling from the sky 
 Where the mountains lean down to the sand 
 We saw blackbirds circling 'round an old castle keep 
 And I stood on the cliff and held your hand
 
 We walked troubles brooding wind swept hills 
 And we loved and we laughed the pain away 
 At the end of the journey, when our last song is sung 
 Will you meet me in Heaven someday
 
 Can't be sure of how's it's going to be 
 When we walk into the light across the bar 
 But I'll know you and you'll know me 
 Out there beyond the stars
 
 We've seen the secret things revealed by God 
 And we heard what the angels had to say 
 Should you go first, or if you follow me 
 Will you meet me in Heaven someday
 
 Living in a mansion on the streets of gold 
 At the corner of Grace and Rapture Way 
 And sweet ecstasy while the ages roll 
 Will you meet me in Heaven someday
 
 In sweet ecstasy while the ages roll 
 Will you meet in Heaven someday
 
 Every year about this time
 My wife Melva made some wine
 Every year about this time
 The air is sweet as Melva's wine
 And I sip her wine and I listen to the robin sings
 And the river runs through Kingston Springs
 
 Every year about this time
 A few old friends come up to walk
 Every year about this time
 A few old friends stop by to talk
 And we talk about the crops and weather and things
 And the young folks here in Kingston Springs
 
 I got the brother up Chicago way
 He wants me to visit him someday and I may sometimes
 But not as long as the robin sings
 And the river runs through Kingston Springs
 
 It was last year about this time
 Melva made her last batch of wine
 It was last year about this time
 She left for me her warm sweet wine
 
 She could sing as sweet as robins sing
 Above her grape in Kingston Springs
 'Cause it was last year about this time
 That Melva made this glass of wine
 
 I got the brother up Chicago way
 He wants me to visit him someday and I may sometimes
 But not as long as the robin sings
 And the river runs through Kingston Springs
 
 'Cause that was last year about this time
 That Melva made this glass of wine
 
 Take one fresh and tender kiss
 Add one stolen night of bliss
 One girl, one boy, some grief, some joy
 Memories are made of this
 
 Don't forget a small moon beam
 Fold in lightly with a dream
 Your lips and mine, two sips of wine
 Memories are made of this
 Then add the wedding bells, one house where lovers dwell 
 Three little kids for the flavor
 Stir carefully through the day
 See how the flavor stays 
 These are the dreams that we will savor
 
 With His blessings from above
 Serve it generously with love
 One man, one wife, one love for life
 Memories are made of this
 Memories are made of this
 Memories are made of this
 
 Well Johnson Van Dyke Grigsby was paroled in '89
 He never walked on a carpet never tasted dinner wine
 His old eyes were slowly fadin' as he walked out of the gate
 And he breathed the first free air he'd breathed since 19-0-8
 Howdy do Michigan City you're sure pretty sight
 But I know there's bigger citties and more excitin' nights
 But I think your girls're pretty and I love your children too
 Michigan City Indiana howdy do Michigan City Indiana howdy do
 Michigan City Indiana howdy do
 
 Filled with the joy of freedom he didn't know that he was old
 'Cause time don't really matter when it's bubblin' in your soul
 Well I don't think he was bitter cause he sure had a smile
 And down the streets of Michigan City he walked his first free miles
 Howdy do Michigan City
 
 Where are you going Miss Tara, Miss Tara?
 Where are you going Miss Tara Joan?
 Yesterday when you played on the swing and the trampoline
 You're already thinkin' of a life of your own
 And I turned around twice and you're already gone
 
 Who will you marry Miss Tara, Miss Tara?
 Who will you marry Miss Tara Joan?
 Will he have wealth and will he have fame?
 I'm sure too you're wonderin' just who he will be
 Well, that's your decision, it's not up to me
 
 I hope you'll be happy Miss Tara, Miss Tara
 I hope you'll be happy Miss Tara Joan
 And that you will stay with me till you're a woman
 And wise to the world before you're off on your own
 You're my last baby girl and I'll be so alone
 
 In a Mississippi cotton pickin' delta town
 One dusty street to walk up and down
 Nothing much to do but hang around
 In a Mississippi cotton pickin' delta town
 
 Down in the delta where I was born
 All we raised was cotton, potatoes and corn
 I've picked cotton 'til my fingers hurt
 Draggin' a sack through the delta dirt
 I've worked hard the whole weeklong
 Pickin' my fingers to the blood and bone
 Ain't a lot of money in cotton bale
 At least when you try to sell
 
 On Saturday night, we'd get dressed up
 Catch us a ride on a pickup truck
 On a gravel road that nearly strangled us
 That cotton pickin' delta dust
 We'd sit across the street on the depot porch
 Lookin' at the folks lookin' back at us
 Munchin' on a dust covered ice cream cone
 Wondering how we'd get back home
 
 I was born down in the bottoms of the flat black Delta land
 I grew up picking cotton in the Mississippi sand
 My mama said son take that girl and go make her your wife
 Or you'll be stuck here in this mud all of your life
 
 Will the water roll it all way this secret that I hold
 Will the water roll it all away will it cleanse my aching soul
 But a man's gotta make it sometime a man's gotta take a stand
 Or he'll get left in the Mississippi sand
 
 A stranger came to town with two torn shoes upon his feet
 Singing songs of sadness picking girls off of the street
 He made a little bit of music was a leader of a band
 And they call him the muddy Mississippi band
 
 My girl was Ruby Colter and she was on her teens
 I took her out to churches to socials schools and things
 She was a rose just right for picking and he nipped her in the bud
 And he left her here in the Mississippi mud
 
 Will the water roll it all way this secret that I hold
 Will the water roll it all away will it cleanse my aching soul
 But a man's gotta make it sometime a man's gotta take a stand
 Or he'll get left in the Mississippi sand
 
 Then me and old Carl we caught him right down by the store
 We choked him just a little bit and held him to the floor
 We relived him of his pocketbook his blood and other things
 Now the Mississippi man's no longer mean
 
 Will the water roll it all way this secret that I hold
 Will the water roll it all away will it cleanse my aching soul
 But a man's gotta make it sometime a man's gotta take a stand
 Or he'll get left in the Mississippi sand
 
 Hush a bye my baby slumber time is coming soon
 Rest your head on mommie's breast while daddy hums a tune
 Are the old folks were humming the banjos were strumming 
 And the soft breezes sigh as in days long gone by
 Way down in Missouri where I heard this melody
 When I was a little fellow on my mommie's knee
 The old folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and low
 
 Hush a bye my baby go to sleep on daddy's knee
 Journey back to Dixie Land in dreams again with me
 Oh, it seems like your daddy was there once again
 And the old folks were strumming that same old refrain
 Way down in Missouri when I heard this lullaby
 While the stars were blinking and the moon was shining high
 Are the old folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and low
 
 Me and my brother was down close to the depot
 When I heard the report of a pistol
 I hollered, "I wonder what was that!"
 
 He run out and come back and he said
 "That was a report of a pistol"
 
 And I thought I was gonna faint when he said it
 "Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
 Mr. Garfield's been shot down low"
 
 Lord, I knew the President was supposed to be down the depot that day
 But I just wouldn't let myself believe that he'd been shot
 
 Me and my bother run out there and everybody was all confused
 And hollering' and running' round
 And I stepped up to this one lady and I said that
 
 "Ma'am what was it really that happened Ma'am?", and she said that
 "Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
 Mr. Garfield's been shot down low"
 
 Well, it looked like everybody felt just about as bad as I did
 Everybody started drift off to home
 Me and my brother did too
 
 Then a few weeks later, I heard that the President was still alive
 So I told my brother, I said, "Hey let's get on a train
 And go to that Big House up there and see how the President is"
 
 "Let's go up there to where he's laid up hurt and sick we'd see him"
 So we went on up there and that big White House
 And there was a soldier boy standin' round upside, outside
 
 And, I sidled up to him and I said to that soldier boy
 I said "Who was it that did it?
 Who was it that shot the President?"
 And he said that, "It was Charlie Guiteau that shot Mr. Garfield"
 
 And I said, "Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man, good man
 Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
 Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man, good man"
 
 That soldier boy said that
 Miss Lucretia Garfield was always at his bedside
 In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot
 
 And he said just that mornin' that he had been at the window
 And he'd overheard Miss Lucretia and Mr. Garfield talkin'
 And Mr Garfield said, "Crete, honey", he called her Crete
 
 He said, "Crete, honey, if somethin' worse would happens to me"
 He said, "You get yourself a good man"
 And she said, "Now James", she called him James
 
 She said, "James, I won't hear to that now
 'Cause I love you too much"
 
 And he said that "You'll make some good man a good wife, good wife
 You'll make some man a good wife gal
 Don't pull in single harness all your life, good gal
 Don't pull in single harness all your life"
 
 That's what he said, "Don't pull in single harness all your life"
 
 Well a little while later, we come back around there
 And things have changed
 The flag was hangin' halfway up the flagpole
 
 And everybody was cryin' and standin' 'round sad
 And I walked back up to this soldier boy and I said
 "Soldier boy, is he, is Mr Garfield?" and he said, "Yeah, he's gone"
 
 Gonna lay him by that cold lonesome branch down low
 Mr. Garfield's been shot down low
 Oh, Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
 Mr. Garfield's been shot down low
 
 Have you heard the news?
 Mr. Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down
 Mr. Garfield's been shot down low, Lord
 
 Mountain lady do you sit on your front porch in the cool of the day
 Mountain lady did you think your kids would ever come back to stay
 Mountain lady does the columbine still twine around your door
 And did you ever get a rug
 To cover the cracks where my diaper drug on your wooden floor
 Oh you Appalachian lady once I was your little baby
 And you rocked me in your homemade rockin' chair
 Since I heard the wild goose callin' I have done a lot of fallin'
 Mountain lady someday I'll come to you there
 
 Mountain lady does the country church bell ring on Sunday morn
 Mountain lady do you still wear that old apron ragged and torn
 Mountain lady on winter nights before our old fireplace
 As you look into the flame do you ever call my name and do you see my face
 Oh you Appalachian lad.
 Mountain lady
 
 Mr Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr Garfield been shot down low
 Me and my brother was down close to the depot when I heard the report of a pistol
 My brother run out and come back in all excited
 
 And I said what was it and he said it was the report of a pistol and then he said
 Mr Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr Garfield been shot down low
 Lord I knew the President was supposed to be at the depot that day
 And we just wouldn't believe that he's shot
 
 But we'd run over there and there was so many folks around
 That we couldn't see him but some lady was standin' there cryin'
 And I said mam what was it that happened mam and she said
 Mr Garfield been shot down shot down shot down Mr Garfield been shot down low
 Well everybody drifted off toward home finally
 
 And they looked like they felt about as bad as I did
 But in a few weeks I heard that the President was still alive
 And I told my brother I said let's get on that train and go to where he's laid up hurt
 Well when we got to his big house up there I asked the fellow
 I said who was it that did it who was it that shoot the President
 And he said it was Charlie Guiteau that shoot Mr Garfield and I said
 Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man good man
 Charlie Guiteau done shot down a good man low
 
 I heard some fellow there that had been in the house to see the President
 And I sidled up him to listen to what he was tellin' and he said
 Mrs Lucretia Garfield was always at his side
 In the heat of the day fannin' him when he was hot
 He said that just that day the President said to Mrs Lucretia
 He said Crete honey 
 
 Said if somethin' worse happens to me after awhile you get yourself a good man
 And Mrs Lucretia said James 
 She said I won't hear to that now she said I love you too much but he said
 You'll make some good man a good wife good wife
 You'll make some man a good good good wife
 (Don't pull in single harness all your life good gal
 Don't pull in single harness all your life)
 
 That's what he said don't pull in single harness all your life
 Well a few days later I come back to where the President was restin'
 And it seems everybody was cryin'
 
 The flag was hangin' halfway up to the flagpole in front of the house
 And everybody looked so sad and I asked a soldier boy there
 And I said is is is Mr Garfield and he said yeah he's gone
 Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground down low
 Gonna lay him in that cold lonesome ground
 
 Well they laid the President by that long cold branch Mr Garfield's been laid down low
 Mr Garfield has been shot down Mr Garfield's been shot
 
 I've got no fire inside of me can't be the man I try to be
 Oh Mr Lonesome hanging round
 Don't wanna see nobody don't wanna be nobody
 Oh Mr Lonesome got me down
 He makes me leave the party when folks are laughin' hearty
 Happiness is one thing he can't stand
 Nobody wants or needs me I go just where he leads me
 Oh Mr Lonesome got my hand
 And so my whole life over each day is like the other but still if my one wish could be
 If that old chain that binds me breaks when true love finds me
 And Mr Lonesome sets me free oh Mr Lonesome got me down
 
 I prayed to feel more joy in my salvation
 A selfish prayer I finally came to know
 For the greatest joy while living comes to me when I am giving
 Giving children bread of life and watch them grow
 
 And my greatest joy is knowing that my children walk in truth
 And that they are giving you Lord of their fire and strength of youth
 Yes, I've found the greatest joy in my salvation
 Is knowing that my children walk in truth
 
 It's hard to feed someone else when you're hungry
 And don't try to teach when you don't understand
 No one will follow you if you don't live it each day through
 And a frightened child won't hold a trembling hand
 
 And my greatest joy is knowing that my children walk in truth
 And that they are giving you Lord of their fire and strength of youth
 Yes, I've found the greatest joy of my salvation
 Is knowing that my children walk in truth
 
 Far away upon a hill on a sunny mountain side 
 Many years ago we parted, my own true love and I 
 From the sunny mountain side 
 
 Oh she clung to me and trembled, when I told her we must part 
 And she said don't go my darling I know twill break my heart 
 When we two are far apart 
 
 Carry me back to old Virginia back to my clinch mountain home 
 Carry me back to old Virginia back to my old mountain home 
 
 My mother's old and feeble and my father's getting gray 
 Carry me back to old Virginia for its there I want to stay 
 
 Oh I held her in my arms leaned her head upon my breast 
 And I told her that I'd wed her when I come back from the west 
 To my old clinch mountain home 
 
 In my hand I hold a picture of the old home far away 
 And the picture of my sweetheart 
 I'm thinking of today 
 On the sunny mountain side
 
 
 There are some things I may not know there are some places I can't go 
 But I am sure of this one thing my God is real for I can feel him in my soul 
 My god is real real in my soul my God is real for he has washed and made me whole 
 His love for me is like pure gold my God is real for I can feel him in my soul 
  
 Some folks may doubt some folks may scorn 
 Well they can all go on just leave me alone 
 But ask for me I'll take God's part my God is real for I can feel him in my heart 
 My god is real real...
 
 My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
 So it stood ninety years on the floor
 It was taller by half than the old man himself
 Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
 
 It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
 And was always his treasure and pride
 But it stopped, short never to go again
 When the old man died
 
 Ninety years without slumbering
 His life seconds numbering
 It stopped, short never to go again
 When the old man died
 
 My grandfather said that of those he could hire
 Not a servant so faithful he found
 For it wasted no time and had but one desire
 At the close of each week to be wound
 
 And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
 And its hands never hung by its side
 But it stopped short, never to go again
 When the old man died
 
 It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
 An alarm that for years had been dumb
 And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
 That his hour for departure had come
 
 Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
 As we silently stood by his side
 But it stopped short, never to go again
 When the old man died
 
 Ninety years without slumbering
 His life seconds numbering
 It stopped short, never to go again
 When the old man died
 
 Two drummers sat at dinner in a grand hotel one day
 While dining they were chatting in a jolly sort of way
 When a pretty waitress brought them a fancy tray of food
 They spoke to her familiarly in a manner rather rude
 
 At first she did not notice, or make the least reply
 But one remark was passed that brought teardrops to her eyes
 and facing her tormentors, with cheeks now burning red
 She looked the perfect picture as appealingly she said
 
 My Mother was a lady and yours, you will allow
 and you may have a sister who needs protection now
 I've come to this great city to find a brother dear
 and you'd dare not insult me, sir, if Jack were only here
 
 It's just one touch of nature
 But it makes the whole World kin
 And every word she uttered seemed to touch their hearts within
 
 They sat there stunned in silence, until one cried in shame
 Forgive me, miss, I meant no harm, pray tell me what's your name
 She told him and he cried I know your brother too
 Why we've been friends for many years and he often speaks of you
 He'll be so glad to see ypu and if you'll only wed
 I'll take you to him as my wife for I've loved you since you said
 
 My Mother was a lady like yours, you will allow
 And you may have a sister who needs protection now
 I've come to this great city to find a brother dear
 and you'd dare not insult me, sir, if Jack were only here 
 
 Turpentine and dandelion wine
 I've turned the corner an' I'm doin' fine
 Shootin' at the birds on the telephone line
 Pickin' 'em off with this gun o' mine
 Got a fire in my belly and a fire in my head
 Going higher and higher till I'm dead
 
 Sister Sue is short and stout, she didn't grow up, she grew out
 Momma says, she's plain but she's just being kind
 Papa thinks she's pretty but he's almost blind
 Don't let her out much except at night
 But I don't care 'cause I'm all right
 
 Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
 Young folks roll on the floor
 Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
 Keep them hard times away from my door
 
 Brother Gene is big and mean and he don't have much to say
 He had a little woman who he whooped each day
 But now she's gone away got drunk last night
 Kicked momma down the stairs but I'm all right
 So I don't care
 
 Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
 And the young folks are rollin' on the floor
 Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
 Keep them hard times away from my door
 
 Turpentine and dandelion wine
 I've turned the corner an' I'm doin' fine
 Shootin' at the birds on the telephone line
 Pickin' 'em off with this gun o' mine
 Got a fire in my belly and a fire in my head
 Goin' higher and higher till I'm dead
 
 Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
 And the young folks are rollin' on the floor
 Oh, the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home
 Keep them hard times away from my door
 Keep them hard times away from my door
 
 I will walk this road a while
 I will walk it with a smile
 I will take it in my stride
 Someday I'll be satisfied
 
 Life is just a passing moment
 On an never ending trail
 Though my pathway wanders for a while
 Someday my ship will sail
 
 And I will walk this road a while
 I will walk it with a smile
 I will take it in my stride
 Someday I'll be satisfied
 
 There's eternity before me
 Just beyond the darkening veil
 But my spirit hungers to go on
 Someday my ship will sail
 
 And I will walk this road a while
 I will walk it with a smile
 I will take it in my stride
 Someday I'll be satisfied
 
 I will walk this road a while
 I will walk it with a smile
 I will take it in my stride
 Someday I'll be satisfied
 
 I will walk this road a while
 I will walk it with a smile
 I will take it in my stride
 Someday I'll be satisfied
 Someday I'll be satisfied
 
 I may say that I don't care hold up head up in the air 
 Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call 
 But when the day is through my heartaches start anew 
 And that's when I miss you most of all 
 
 And my arms keep reaching for you my eyes keep searching for you 
 My lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you 
 
 No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again 
 'Cause nothing else means half as much as you 
 My world just seemed to die the day you left my side 
 And I can't forget no matter what I do 
 
 And my arms keep reaching...
 
 
 Nasty Dan was the meanest man I ever knew
 He's stomp and scream and be real mean the whole day through
 He'd frown a bunch he ate nails for lunch and he'd never laugh
 He'd growl and yell and I hard tell that he never took a bath
 
 Nasty Dan was a nasty man
 Hard to understand that Nasty Dan
 
 Now Nasty Dan was a nasty man the whole day long
 He'd go where he could he'd try real good to make things go wrong
 He'd jump for joy when a little boy would trip and fall
 And the only words that he ever said were I don't like you at all
 
 Nasty Dan was a nasty man
 Hard to understand that Nasty Dan
 
 Now a real interesting thing that I want you to know about is this here
 Because it's the most important thing it concerns a girl and things like that
 Now Nasty Pearl was a nasty girl that met Dan somehow
 She said you like me rotten as can be let's get married now
 
 So they went and they did and had a nasty kid
 And I must confess that Dan pretty much leaves everyone alone now
 And he doesn't bother anybody anymore cause he just lives in his nasty ol' house
 With his nasty ol' wife and his nasty ol' kid in nasty happiness
 
 Nasty Dan was a nasty man
 Hard to understand that Nasty Dan
 
 In Australia a bandit or an outlaw was called a bushranger
 One of Australia's most infamous bushrangers was a man named Ned Kelly
 
 Ned Kelly was a wild young bushranger
 Out of Victoria he rode with his brother Dan
 He loved his people and he loved his freedom
 And he loved to ride the wide open land
 
 Ned Kelly was a victim of the changes
 That came when his land was a sprout and seed
 And the wrongs he did were multiplied in legend
 With young Australia growing like a weed
 
 Ned Kelly took the blame
 Ned Kelly won the fame
 Ned Kelly brought the shame
 And then Ned Kelly hanged
 
 Well he hid out in the bush and in the forest
 And he loved to hear the wind blow in the trees
 While the men behind the badge were coming for him
 Ned said they'll never bring me to my knees
 
 But everything was changed and run in cycles
 And Ned knew that his day was at an end
 He made a suit of armour out of ploughshares
 But Ned was brought down by the trooper's men
 
 Ned Kelly took the blame
 Ned Kelly won the fame
 Ned Kelly brought the shame
 And then Ned Kelly hanged
 
 Coleman Bonner was a fiddle playin' fool 
 He's a backwoods rounder and a breaker of mules 
 Coleman Bonner's got a wore out bow 
 He's been playin' all day down the new cut road 
 
 Coleman's little sister said you better act right, Coleman 
 Daddy's gone to Louisville he'll be back tonight 
 He's gonna get another wagon and a good pair of mules 
 And we gonna move to Texas we just waitin' on you 
 
 Coleman's daddy pulled up in the yard 
 He said pack up your lives kids, it's gettin' too hard 
 Kentucky's alright but there's too many people 
 Just the other day I thought I saw a church steeple 
 
 Coleman said daddy don't you worry bout me 
 I'm gonna stay here in Kentucky till the day I d 
 I'm gonna drink that sour mash and gonna race that mare 
 And find that woman with the fox red hair 
 
 Now you all been movin' west since the day you got married 
 Well I'm gettin' off the wagon, daddy, I'm too old to be carried 
 Gonna stay here in Kentucky where the bluegrass grow 
 I'm gonna play it all night down the new cut road 
 
 Coleman's daddy said now what's it all comin' to 
 Young people these days are just as stubborn as mules 
 You can't make him go, naw he's too old for that 
 It's that damned old fiddle and that bowler hat 
 
 Coleman's mama said let the boy stay 
 He's raised up solid and he can find his own way 
 But as for me honey I'm with you 
 I always thought Kentucky was just passin' through 
 
 Coleman's little sister then she started into a cryin' 
 And his daddy shook his head for the very last time 
 Coleman's mama said somebody's gotta do it 
 Wouldn't be no Kentucky less you didn't stick to it Coleman 
 
 Coleman Booner stood on the porch of that cabin 
 Watched 'em all go to Texas in a covered wagon 
 He pulled out his fiddle and he rosined up his bow 
 And he played a little tune called the new cut road
 
 T'was in the town of Griffin, the year was Eighty three
 It was there an old cow puncher, stepped up and said to me
 How do you do young fellow and how would you like to go
 And spend a pleasant summer, out in New Mexico
 
 I'll furnish you good wages, your transportation too
 If you will but go with me, one summer season through
 But if you should get homesick and back to Griffin go
 Then I'll furnish you no horses from the hills of Mexico
 
 We left the town of Griffin in the merry month of May
 When all the world was lovely and everything was gay
 With saddles on our horses, marching over we did go
 Until we reached the logging out in New Mexico
 
 It was there our pleasures ended and our troubles they began
 The first hail storm fell on us, those cattle how they ran
 Through all the thorns and thistles, us cowboys had to go
 While the Indians watched upon us, out in New Mexico
 
 Well, when the drive was over, the riders would not pay
 To all you happy people, this much I have to say
 Go back to your friends and loved ones, tell others not to go
 To the God forsaken country, they call New Mexico
 
 When the evenin' sun goes down
 You will find me hangin' 'round
 The night life, it ain't no good life
 But it's my life
 
 Many people just like me
 Dreamin' of old used-to-be's
 Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
 Ah, but it's my life
 
 Listen to the blues that they're playin'
 Listen what the blues are sayin'
 
 Life is just another scene
 In this old world of broken dreams
 Oh, the night life, it ain't no good life
 But it's my life
 
 Oh, the night life ain't no good life
 Oh, but it's my life
 
 Listen to what the blues are saying
 
 Life is just another scene
 From the world of broken dreams
 And the night life ain't no good life
 but its my life
 the night life ain't no good life
 but, it's my life
 
 Well this nine pound hammer is a little too heavy for my size honey for my size 
 I'm goin' on the mountain gonna see my baby 
 And I ain't comin' back Lord I ain't comin' back 
 Oh roll on buddy don't you roll so slow how can I go when my wheels won't roll 
 Roll on buddy pull a load o'coal how can I go when my wheels won't roll 
 
 Well it's a long way to Harlem it's a long way to Hazzard 
 Just to get a little brew just to get a little brew 
 Now when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone 
 Out of number nine coal out of number nine coal 
 Roll on buddy
 
 Our little boy came up to his mama in the kitchen this evening
 While she was fixing supper
 And he handed her a piece of paper he'd been writin' on
 And after wipin' her hands on her apron she read it and this is what it said
 
 For mowing the yard 5 dollars
 For making my own bed this week 1 dollar
 For going to the store 50 cents
 For playing with my little brother while you went shopping 25 cents
 For taking out the trash 1 dollar
 For getting a good report card 5 dollars
 And for raking the yard 2 dollars
 Total amount owed 14 dollars and 75 cents
 
 Well as mama looked at him standing there expectantly
 And I could see the memories flashing through her mind
 And so she picked up the pen and turning the paper over
 This is what she wrote and I read it to him
 
 For the nine months she carried you growing inside her, no charge
 For the nights we sat up with you, doctoring you, praying for you, no charge
 For the time and the tears that you've caused through the years there's no charge
 When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge
 
 For the nights filled with dread and the worries ahead, no charge
 For advice and for knowledge and the cost of your college, no charge
 For the toys food and clothes and for wiping your nose there's no charge
 When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge
 
 Well when I finished readin' he had big tears in his eyes
 And he looked up at his mother and he said mama I sure do love you
 Then he took the pen and in great big letter he wrote Paid In Full
 When you added all up the full cost of our love is no charge
 
 Come heed me, my brothers, come heed, one and all
 Don't brag about standing or you'll surely fall
 You're shining your light and shine it you should
 But you're so heavenly minded, you're no earthly good
 
 If you're holding heaven, then spread it around
 There's hungry hands reaching up here from the ground
 Move over and share the high ground where you stood
 So heavenly minded, you're no earthly good
 
 The gospel ain't gospel until it is spread
 But how can you share it where you've got your head
 There's hands that reach out for a hand if you would
 So heavenly minded, you're no earthly good
 
 If you're holding heaven, then spread it around
 There's hungry hands reaching up here from the ground
 Move over and share the high ground where you stood
 So heavenly minded, you're no earthly good
 
 No one will ever know my heart is breaking
 Although a million teardrops start to flow
 I'll cry myself to sleep and wake up smiling
 I'll love you but no one will ever know
 
 I'll tell them we grew tired of each other
 And that I was glad the day you set me free
 I'll even make believe I never loved you
 And no one will ever know the truth but me
 
 I'll tell them we grew tired
 
 When life seems full of clouds and rain
 And I'm full of nothin' but pain
 Who soothes my thumpin', bumpin' brain?
 Nobody
 
 When winter-time comes with its snow and sleet
 And me with hunger and cold feet
 Who says, "Here's two bits, go and eat?"
 Nobody
 
 Oh, well I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
 I ain't never got nothin' from from nobody, no time
 And until I get somethin' from somebody, sometime
 I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time
 
 When summer-time comes all warm and clear 
 And my friends see me drawin' near
 Who says, "Come on in, and have a beer?"
 Nobody
 
 Well, one time when things was lookin' bright
 I started to whittle it on a stick one night
 Who said, "Hey! That's dynamite!"
 Nobody
 
 I ain't ever done nothin'  to nobody
 I ain't ever got nothin' from nobody, no time
 And until I get somethin' from somebody, sometime
 I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time
 
 I ain't ever done nothin'  to nobody
 I ain't ever got nothin' from nobody, no time
 And until I get somethin' from somebody, sometime
 I don't intend to do nothin' for nobody, no time

 O come, let us adore Him
 Christ, the Lord
 
 Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
 The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
 
 For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
 While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
 Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
 And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.
 
 Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
 The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
 
 Lord, I've never lived where churches grow 
 I loved creation better as it stood 
 That day you finished it so long ago 
 And looked upon your work and called it good 
 I know that others find you in the light 
 That sifted down through tinted window panes 
 And yet I seem to feel you near tonight 
 In this dim, quiet starlight on the plains 
 
 I thank you, Lord, that I'm placed so well 
 That you've made my freedom so complete 
 That I'm no slave to whistle, clock or bell 
 Nor weak eyed prisoner of Waller Street 
 Just let me live my life as I've begun 
 And give me work that's open to the sky 
 Make me a partner of the wind and sun 
 And I won't ask a life that's soft or high 
 
 Let me be easy on the man that's down 
 Let me be square and generous with all 
 I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when I'm in town 
 But never let them say I'm mean or small 
 Make me as big and open as the plains 
 And honest as the horse between my knees 
 Clean as a wind that blows behind the rains 
 Free as the hawk that circles down the breeze 
 
 Forgive me, Lord, if sometimes I forget 
 You know about the reasons that are hid 
 You understand the things that gall or fret 
 Well, you knew me better than my mother did 
 Just keep an eye on all that's done or said 
 And right me sometimes when I turn aside 
 And guide me on that long, dim trail ahead 
 That stretches upward toward the great divide
 
 Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie 
 These words came low and mournfully 
 From the pallid lips of a youth who lay 
 On his dying bed at the close of day
 
 Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there 
 But we took no heed to his dying prayer 
 In a shallow grave just six by three 
 We buried him there on the lone prairie
 
 Everybody's going out
 And having fun 
 I'm just a fool for staying home
 And having none 
 
 I can't get over
 How she set me free
 Oh, lonesome me
 
 A bad mistake I'm making
 By just hanging round
 
 I know that I should have
 Some fun and paint the town
 
 I've thought of everything
 From A to Z 
 Oh, lonesome me
 
 I'll bet she's not like me
 She's out and fancy free
 Flirting with the boys
 With all her charms
 
 But I still love her so
 And, brother, don't you know
 I'd welcome her right back here
 In my arms 
 
 Well. there must be some way
 I can lose these lonesome blues
 
 Forget about the past and
 Find somebody new 
 
 I've thought of everything
 From A to Z 
 Oh, lonesome me
 
 Well, I'll bet she's not like me
 She's out and fancy free
 Flirting with the boys
 With all her charms
 
 But I still love her so
 And, brother, don't you know
 I'd welcome her right back here
 In my arms 
 
 Well. there must be some way
 I can lose these lonesome blues
 
 Forget about the past and
 Find somebody new 
 
 I've thought of everything
 From A to Z 
 Oh, lonesome me
 Oh, lonesome me

 Sunshine and showers and everything comin' up daisies
 Oh, what a good thing we had gone bad, oh, what a good thing we had
 Drive-in's and picnics end every day was Saturday
 Oh, what a good thing we had gone bad, oh, what a good thing we had
 
 The whole wide world was jealous, we wouldn't hear a thing they'd tell us
 Never did need any money, everything was milk and honey
 Oh, long walks by the river, talkin' 'bout livin' together
 Oh, what a good thing we had gone bad, oh, what a good thing we had
 
 Long weeks of waitin' and livin' for the day we marry
 Oh, what a good thing we had gone bad, oh, what a good thing we had
 Happiness and laughter, we found everything we were after
 Oh, what a good thing we had gone bad, oh, what a good thing we had
 
 The whole wide world was jealous, we wouldn't hear a thing they'd tell us
 Never did need any money, everything was milk and honey
 Oh, long walks by the river, talkin' 'bout livin' together
 Oh, what a good thing we had gone bad, oh, what a good thing we had
 Oh, what a good thing we had gone bad, oh, what a good thing we had
 
 Oh!
 On an early autumn day
 Freshness of the breeze brought the mornin'
 And the sun came risin' up
 Shinin' down on leaves that fell like golden snow
 And the mystery of it all
 Made the problems of the day seem unimportant
 That Oklahoma mornin'
 
 Puts Oklahoma sunshine in my soul
 There ain't nothin' like an Oklahoma mornin'
 Nothin' like it when you're feelin' low
 It warms up your mind and your body
 It puts Oklahoma sunshine in your soul
 
 Our campfire came to life
 The crackling of the fire and smell of coffee
 Turned back the time
 To a day when a man could listen for a while
 To the sound of mother nature
 Without the sound of industry in the background
 
 That Oklahoma mornin'
 Puts Oklahoma sunshine in my smi-I-ile
 There ain't nothin' like an Oklahoma mornin'
 Nothin' like it when you're feelin' low
 It'll warm up your mind and your body
 It puts Oklahoma sunshine in your soul
 
 One more time
 There ain't nothin' like an Oklahoma mornin'
 Nothin' like it when you're feelin' low
 It'll warm up your mind and your body
 It puts Oklahoma sunshine in your soul
 It puts Oklahoma sunshine in your soul
 
 Whoa! Thank you
 
 Old Apache squaw how many long lean years you saw 
 How many bitter winter nights shiverin' in a cold teepee shiverin' in a cold teepee 
 Old Apache squaw how many hungry kids you saw 
 How many bloody warriors runnin' to the sea fleein' to the sea 
 Well now they tell me that you saw Cochise when he made his last stand 
 He said the next white man that sees my face is gonna be a dead white man 
 Old Apache squaw how many broken hearts you saw 
 Have you had misty eyes for years could that mist be tears could that mist be tears 
 Well now they tell me... 
 Old Apache squaw
 
 I'm just an old chunk of coal
 But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
 
 I'm gonna grow and glow 'til I'm so blue, pure perfect
 I'm gonna put a smile on everybody's face
 
 But I'm gonna kneel and pray everyday
 Lest I should become vain along the way
 
 I'm just an old chunk of coal, now Lord
 But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
 
 I'm gonna learn the right way to talk
 I'm gonna search and find a better way to walk
 
 I'm gonna spit and polish my old rough-edged self
 Until I get rid of every single flaw
 
 I'm gonna be the world's best friend
 I'm gonna go around shakin' everybody's hand
 
 I'm gonna be the cotton-pickin' rage of the age
 Yes, I'm gonna be a diamond some day
 
 I said, "I'm just an old chunk of coal, my Lord
 But I'm gonna be a diamond some day"
 
 He was just an old country doctor in a little country town 
 Fame and fortune had passed him by though we never saw him frown 
 As day by day in his kindly way he'd serve us one and all 
 Many a patient forgot to pay although Doc's fees were small 
 Though he needed his dimes and there were times that he'd receive a fee 
 He'd pass it onto some poor soul that needed it worse than he 
 He had to sell his furniture couldn't pay his office rent 
 So to a dusty room over a livery stable Doc Brown and his satchel went 
 And on the hitchin' post at the kerb below to advertise his wares 
 He nailed a little sign that read Doc Brown has moved upstairs 
 And one day he didn't answer when they knocked upon his door 
 Old Doc Brown was layin' down but his soul was no more 
 They found him there in that old black suit on his face was a smile of content 
 But all the money they could find on him was a quarter and a copper cent 
 So they opened up his ledger and what they saw gave their hearts a pull 
 Beside each debtor's name old Doc had write these words Paid In Full 
 Old Doc should had a funeral fine enough for a king 
 It's a ghastly joke our town was broke and no one could give a thing 
 Cept Jones an undertaker he did mighty well 
 Donated an old iron casket he had never been able to sell 
 And the funeral procession it wasn't much for grace and pomp and the style 
 But those wagon loads of mourners they stretched out for more than a mile 
 We wanted to give him a monument we kinda figured we owed him one 
 Cause he made our town a better place for all the good he'd done 
 We pulled up that old hitchin' post where Doc had nailed a sign 
 We'd painted it white and to all of us it certainly did look fine 
 Now the rains and the snows have washed away our white trimmin's of paint 
 There ain't nothin' left but Doc's own sign and that's gettin' pretty faint 
 But you can still see that old hitchin' post as if in answer to our prayers 
 Mutually tellin' the whole wide world Doc Brown has moved upstairs
 
 When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup over hills and meadows we'd play
 Just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun we grew up together that way
 I remember the time at the old swimming hole
 When I would have drowned beyond doubt
 But old Shep was right there to the rescue he came
 He jumped in and helped pull me out
 Now the years they rolled by and old Shep he grew old
 His eye sight at last it grew dim
 Then one day the doctor looked at him and said I can't do no more for him Jim
 With a hand that was trembling I picked up my gun
 And I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
 But I just couldn't do it I wanted to run I wished they would shoot me instead
 Now old Shep is gone where the good doggies go
 And no more on this earth will he roam
 But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know old Shep has a wonderful home
 
 I could lie here forever, listen to the falling rain
 I didn't think I would ever get touched this way again
 Until you came, you smiled at me and rolled away the years
 Back to a place there was time enough to love, love enough to give
 
 You give me that old time feeling
 You give me that old time feeling
 We'll find a better place, a feeling that we can't erase
 The rainbows that we chased will never end
 
 We're coming close again
 When your love lets me in
 I don't know where I stop and you begin
 You give me that old time feeling
 
 In the early morning walking, I have you by my side
 The morning breeze is blowing all the trouble from my mind
 And when evening comes, we'll watch the moon ride easy in the sky
 The way it used to be, that old way of loving is coming back to me
 
 You give me that old time feeling
 You give me that old time feeling
 We'll find a better place, a feeling that we can't erase
 The rainbows that we chased will never end
 
 We're coming close again
 When your love lets me in
 I don't know where I stop and you begin
 You give me that old time feeling
 You give me that old time feeling
 
 High on the mountain what do I see
 There's bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
 You better get your rifle boys before it's too late
 That bear's got a little pig and headed for the gate
 
 He's bigger around the middle and he's broad across the rump
 Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet jumps
 Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treat
 Some folks say he looks a lot like me
 
 Well I got me some money and I got me some bees
 And they started makin' honey way up in the trees
 I chopped down the trees cause my honey's all gone
 Old Slew foot's done made himself at home
 
 He's bigger around the middle and he's broad across the rump
 Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet jumps
 Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treat
 Some folks say he looks a lot like me
 Some folks say he looks a lot like daddy
 
 Winter's comin' on and it's forty below
 The river's frozen over so where can he go
 I'd get me a rifle boys and run him in the well
 Then I shoot him in the bottom just to hear him yell
 
 He's bigger around the middle and he's broad across the rump
 Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' forty feet jumps
 Ain't never been caught he ain't never been treat
 Some folks say he looks a lot like me
 Some folks say he looks a lot like my Johnny
 
 The baby's eyes are red from weeping
 It's little heart is filled with pain
 And Daddy cried they're taking Mama
 Away from us on the evening train
 
 I heard the laughter at the depot
 But my tears fell like the rain
 When I saw them place that long white casket
 In the baggage coach of the evening train
 
 As I turned to walk away from the depot
 It seemed I heard her call my name
 Take care of baby and tell him darling
 That I'm going home on the evening train
 
 I pray that God will give me courage
 To carry on 'til we meet again
 It's hard to know she's gone forever
 They're carrying her home on the evening train
 
 On the road again
 Just can't wait to get on the road again
 The life I love is making music with my friends
 And I cant wait to get on the road again
 
 On the road again
 Goin' places that I've never been
 Seein' things that I may never see again
 I can't wait to get on the road again
 
 On the road again
 Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
 We're the best of friends
 Insisting that the world keep turning our way
 And our way, is on the road again
 
 Just cant wait to get on the road again
 The life I love is making music with my friends
 And I cant wait to get on the road again
 
 On the road again
 Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
 We're the best of friends
 Insisting that the world keep turning our way
 And our way
 
 Is on the road again
 Just can't wait to get on the road again
 The life I love is making music with my friends
 And I cant wait to get on the road again
 And I cant wait to get on the road again
 
 Is it getting better
 Or do you feel the same
 Will it make it easier on you now
 If you've got someone to blame
 
 You said one love
 One life
 When it's one need
 In the night
 One love we get to share it
 It leaves you baby if you don't care for it
 
 Did I disappoint you
 Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
 You act like you never had love
 And you want me to go without
 
 Well it's too late
 Tonight
 To drag the past out
 Into the light
 We're one but we're not the same
 We get to carry each other
 Carry each other
 One
 
 Have you come here for forgiveness?
 Have you come to raise the dead?
 Have you come here to play Jesus
 To the lepers in your head?
 
 Did I ask too much?
 More than a lot?
 You gave me nothing now
 It's all I've got
 We're one but we're not the same
 Well we hurt each other and we're doing it again
 
 You said love is a temple
 Love the higher law
 Love is a temple
 Love the higher law
 
 You ask me to enter
 But then you make me crawl
 I can't be holding on
 To what you've got
 When all you've got is hurt
 
 One love
 One blood
 One life
 You've got to do what you should
 One life with each other
 Sister
 Brothers
 One life but we're not the same
 We get to carry each other
 Carry each other
 One
 One
 One
 One
 
 Oh the number one is not my favorite number
 'Cause one means only me and there's no you
 But one plus one you see makes two that's you and me
 And it's more fun when one and one makes two
 Oh yes one and one makes two at least I'm pretty sure they do
 Oh yes it's true one and one makes two
 
 Now let me show you what I mean
 Now you say you want to play upon a seesaw
 You're all alone and you don't know what to do
 Well just go and find a friend and sit him on the other end
 You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
 Oh yes one and one
 
 Now you say you want to play a game of baseball
 And you look around and there's no one but you
 Well just find someone you know and he will catch the ball you throw
 You'll have more fun when one and one makes two
 Oh yes one and one
 
 Now there's the best reason of all that I like to number two right here
 Now everyone needs somebody to share with
 To love and help and care for through and through
 And there's no one that I've known who can share or love alone
 It's a lot nicer when one and one makes two
 Oh yes one and one
 I said it's true one and one makes two
 
 I long for the trip I don't need no grip I'm takin' one more ride 
 Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide 
 Oh the clickety clack of the railroad track is callin' 
 If a man can know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam 
 And the big loud bell that bongs farewell could hear her whistle scream 
 She's bound to go where there ain't no snow a fallin' one more ride one more ride 
 I miss the gloom of the prairie moon that seemed to know my name 
 And the tumbleweed where the prairie don't feed I miss them just the same 
 They're all a part of a song of heart I'm sayin' 
 I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make it smile 
 And I rode away at the close of the day and I stayed so long awhile 
 But I long to be where the memory is ringing one more ride one more ride 
 As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home 
 And to hit the trail of the iron rail away out there alone 
 But my heart would sigh till I know that I am leavin' 
 If I don't come back on a oneway track way down in Mexico 
 You can find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow 
 So it's goodbye now you'll never know how I'm grievin' one more ride one more ride
 
 One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul
 One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul
 I'm gonna ask him about his travelin'
 And he will tell me about it all
 One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul
 
 I'm gonna tell him I read all his books
 I'm gonna tell him I read all his books
 And that is sure was hard to follow down the same road that he took
 But I'm gonna tell him I read all his books
 
 He'll introduce me to Luke and Timothy
 He will introduce me to Luke and Timothy
 I will be so glad to meet them and they will be glad to meet me
 He will introduce me to Luke and Timothy
 
 One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul
 
 One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to
 Sit down and talk to Paul
 I'm gonna meet his friends in Heaven
 I'll be singin' with them all
 One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to Paul
 
 One of these days I'm gonna shake that healing hand
 One of these days I'm gonna shake that healing hand
 That hand that raised up Uticus, that old sleepin', fallen man
 One of these days I'm gonna shake that healing hand
 
 I know just how he felt locked in that jail
 I know just how he felt locked in that jail
 And I bet that him and Silas will have quite a tale to tell
 I know just how he felt locked in that jail
 
 One of these days I'm gonna sit down and
 Sit down and talk to Paul
 One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to 
 Sit down and talk to Paul
 I'm gonna ask him about his journeys
 And he will tell me about them all
 One of these days I'm gonna sit down and talk to
 Sit down and talk to Paul
 
 Well, I left Kentucky back in forty nine
 An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
 The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs
 
 Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
 And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
 'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black.
 
 One day I devised myself a plan
 That should be the envy of most any man
 I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
 Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
 But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
 I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand.
 
 I'd get it one piece at a time
 And it wouldn't cost me a dime
 You'll know it's me when I come through your town
 I'm gonna ride around in style
 I'm gonna drive everybody wild
 'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.
 
 So the very next day when I punched in
 With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
 I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
 I've never considered myself a thief
 But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
 Especially if I strung it out over several years.
 
 The first day I got me a fuel pump
 And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
 Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
 The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
 Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
 But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home.
 
 Now, up to now my plan went all right
 'Til we tried to put it all together one night
 And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong.
 
 The transmission was a fifty three
 And the motor turned out to be a seventy three
 And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone.
 
 So we drilled it out so that it would fit
 And with a little bit of help with an adapter kit
 We had that engine runnin' just like a song
 Now the headlight' was another sight
 We had two on the left and one on the right
 But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on.
 
 The back end looked kinda funny too
 But we put it together and when we got through
 Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
 About that time my wife walked out
 And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
 But she opened the door and said "Honey, take me for a spin."
 
 So we drove up town just to get the tags
 And I headed her right on down main drag
 I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
 But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
 'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
 And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds.
 
 I got it one piece at a time
 And it wouldn't cost me a dime
 You'll know it's me when I come through your town
 I'm gonna ride around in style
 I'm gonna drive everybody wild
 'Cause I'll have the only one there is around.
 
 Ugh! Yeah, RED RYDER
 This is the COTTON MOUTH
 In the PSYCHO-BILLY CADILLAC Come on
 
 Huh, This is the COTTON MOUTH
 And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there RED RYDER
 You might say I went right up to the factory
 And picked it up, it's cheaper that way
 Ugh!, what model is it?
 
 Well, It's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, '56
 '57, '58' 59' automobile
 It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, '67
 '68, '69, '70 automobile.
 
 Down the street the dogs are barkin'
 And the day is a-gettin' dark
 As the night comes in a-fallin'
 The dogs'll lose their bark
 An' the silent night will shatter
 From the sounds inside my mind
 Yes, I'm one too many mornings
 And a thousand miles behind
 
 From the crossroads of my doorstep
 My eyes they start to fade
 And I turn my head back to the room
 Where my love and I have laid
 An' I gaze back to the street
 The sidewalk and the sign
 And I'm one too many mornings
 An' a thousand miles behind
 
 It's a restless hungry feeling
 That don't mean no one no good
 When ev'rything I'm a-sayin'
 You can say it just as good
 You're right from your side
 I'm right from mine
 We're both just one too many mornings
 An' a thousand miles behind
 
 I dedicate this song to the workin' man
 For every man that puts in eight or ten hard hours a day 
 Of work and toil and sweat
 Always got somebody lookin' down his neck
 Tryin' to get more out of him
 Than he really ought to have to put in
 
 After twenty nine long years of workin'
 In this shop with Oney standin' over me
 Today when that old whistle blows
 I'll check in all my gear and I'll retire
 
 The superintendent just dropped by 
 And said they'd planned my little get together
 Then he said I'd never a made it
 If old Oney hadn't a held me to the fire
 
 I've seen him in my dreams at night
 And woke up in the mornin' feelin' tired
 And old Oney don't remember, when I came here
 How he tried to get me fired
 
 With his folded hands behind him
 Every mornin' Oney waited at the gate
 Where he'd rant and rave like I committed murder
 Clockin' in five minutes late.
 
 But today they'll gather 'round me
 Like I've seen 'em do when any man retires
 Then old Oney's gonna tell me
 From now on I'm free to do what I desire
 
 He'll present me with that little old gold watch
 They give a man at times like this
 But there's one thing he's not countin' on
 Today's the day I give old Oney his
 
 I've been workin', buildin' muscles
 Oney's just been standin' 'round a gettin' soft
 And today about four thirty
 I'll make up for every good night's sleep I've lost
 
 When I'm gone I'll be remembered
 As a workin' man who put his point across
 With a right hand full of knuckles
 'Cause today I show old Oney who's the boss
 
 Hmmmm, what time is it? Four thirty?
 Hey, Oney!
 Oney! Ha ha ha ha!
 
 Look a-yonder comin'
 Comin' down that railroad track
 Hey, look a-yonder comin'
 Comin' down that railroad track
 It's the Orange Blossom Special
 Bringin' my baby back
 
 Well, I'm going down to Florida
 And get some sand in my shoes
 Or maybe Californy
 And get some sand in my shoes
 I'll ride that Orange Blossom Special
 And lose these New York blues
 
 "Say man, when you going back to Florida?"
 "When am I goin' back to Florida? I don't know, don't reckon I ever will."
 "Ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?"
 "Well, I don't care if I do-die-do-die-do-die-do-die."
 
 Hey talk about a-ramblin'
 She's the fastest train on the line
 Talk about a-travellin'
 She's the fastest train on the line
 It's that Orange Blossom Special
 Rollin' down the seaboard line
 
 Well, have you seen my dark-haired girl?
 She was set on her love to a hungry world
 They got her clothes and the money she took
 And they wrote her name in the prison books
 
 Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my dark-haired girl?
 She's tired and cold and you got the gold
 She took from a hungry world
 Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my dark-haired girl?
 
 Well have seen my green eyed son?
 He shot a man down with a sawed off gun
 And they fond him down by the Pontchartrain
 Where they cuffed his arms with a big iron chain
 
 Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son?
 I heard him say as you let him away
 Sorry for what he's done
 Orleans Parish Prison won't you free me green eyed son?
 
 Well have you missed my brother man?
 He took a little money with a gun in his hand
 Know the kids are hungry and the wife ain't well
 And the daddy's locked up in a prison cell
 
 Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man?
 I know it's sad but he ain't bad
 He's doing the best he can
 Orleans Parish Prison won't you free my brother man?
 
 From a carnie show and a rodeo that shared a three day stand
 A cowboy met a fiery carnie queen
 In new spring nights amid the lights of the painted carnie van
 They laughed and loved and shared shortlived dreams
 
 But the carnie show and the rodeo went their seperate ways
 And the carnie season bloomed and soon moved on
 And I was born on a winter morn to the dark eyed carnie queen
 The too-late-son of something that was gone
 
 The black sheep child that grew up wild
 From the seed the four winds sowed
 Unwanted son of ice and fire
 An orphan of the road
 
 I was still a child when my mama died
 Of a chill that closed her eyes
 So I was left to grow up on my own
 Without a name too wild to tame no one cared to try
 So mostly I was mostly left alone
 
 In dingy bars and cold boxcars hobo jungle camps
 I joined the men who drift from town to town
 The surgin' flood of restless blood flowed inside my veins
 I'd never find the time to settle down
 
 The black sheep child that grew up wild
 From the seed the four winds sowed
 Unwanted son of ice and fire
 An orphan of the road
 
 In the misty rain I caught the train that slowed down through the town
 And I pulled myself into the boxcar door
 In a passing light in the deep grey night I saw the still dark form
 Of an old man lying sick upon the floor
 
 And he said I tried to find her but they told me that she'd died
 And that she'd left an only son behind
 And I tried to find him but I never did but I know I could rest in peace
 If I could just see him once before I die
 
 I found a match and I quickly scratched it into a flickerin' flame
 Then I held it close and I gently raised his head
 My mother sir I said of her I have her same dark eyes
 He smiled a cowboy smile and then was dead
 
 The black sheep child that grew up wild
 From the seed the four winds sowed
 Unwanted son of ice and fire
 An orphan of the road
 
 It's midnight at a liquor store in Texas
 Closing time another day is done
 When a boy walked in the door and points a pistol
 He can't find a job, but Lord, he's found a gun
 
 He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
 Then he lets the old man run out in the street
 Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
 Already he can feel a great relief
 
 Oh, how many travelers get weary
 Bearing both their burdens and their scars
 Don't you think they'd love to start all over
 And fly like eagles out among the stars?
 
 He pictures the arrival of the cruisers
 Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
 He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
 They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives
 
 Oh, how many travelers get weary
 Bearing both their burdens and their scars
 Don't you think they'd love to start all over
 And fly like eagles out among the stars?
 
 The evening news carries all the details
 He dies in every living room in town
 And in his own a bottle's thrown in anger
 And his father cries, he'll never live this down
 
 Oh, how many travelers get weary
 Bearing both their burdens and their scars
 Don't you think they'd love to start all over
 And fly like eagles out among the stars
 And fly like eagles out among the stars
 
 Out of sight, out of mind, did you ever hear that?
 Out of sight, out of mind
 Out of sight, out of mind
 So the story goes, you never heard that?
 You forgot I exist 
 My broken heart knows
 
 By the way the land is layin?
 I think I?d be safe in sayin?
 That over the next hill we?ll be home
 
 It?s a straight and narrow highway
 No detours and no byways
 And over the next hill we?ll be home
 
 From the prophets I've been hearin?
 I would say the end is nearin?
 For I see familiar landmarks all along
 
 By the dreams that I've been dreamin?
 There will come a great redeemin?
 And over the next hill we?ll be home
 
 By the turn the tide is takin'
 I would say there's no mistakin?
 That over the next hill we?ll be home
 
 there's a place that we are nearin?
 That so many have been fearin?
 And over the next hill we?ll be home
 
 When we get there we're all hopin?
 That we?ll find the gate is open
 And there'll be a refuge from the comin? storm
 
 For the way?s been long and weary
 But at last the end is nearin?
 And over the next hill we?ll be home
 
 But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
 And give them all to me
 You would lose them, I know how to use them
 Give them all to me
 
 No use crying, talking to a stranger
 Naming the sorrows you've seen
 Cause there's too many bad times, too many sad times
 And nobody knows what you mean
 
 But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
 And give them all to me
 You would lose them, I know how to use them
 Give them all to me
 
 No use rambling, walking in the shadows
 Trailing a wandering star
 No one beside you, no one to guide you
 And nobody knows where you are
 
 But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
 And give them all to me
 You would lose them, I know how to use them
 Give them all to me
 
 No use roaming, walking by that roadside
 Seeking a satisfied mind
 There's too many highways, too many byways
 And nobody's walking behind
 
 But if somehow you could pack up your sorrows
 And give them all to me
 You would lose them, I know how to use them
 Give them all to me
 You would lose them, I know how to use them
 Give them all to me
 
 It rained all the way to Cincinnati
 With our mattress on top of the car
 Us kids were eatin' crackers and baloney
 And papa kept on driving never stopped once at a bar
 Then mama started talking about Jesus
 And how our lives could be from now on
 While papa bought a used tire in Columbus
 Mama rocked the baby till all her tears were gone
 
 She said your papa is a good man and don't you kids forget it
 The whiskey's tryin' to ruin him but I know the Lord won't let it
 Then we sang Amazing Grace and Bringing In The Sheaves
 Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
 
 I remember when papa finally gave up drinking
 I think mama was the only one on earth that really thought he could
 I remember all the times we'd packed everything we owned
 Into some old car and started out for some new town
 And through it all mama's faith was the one thing
 That was strong enough to finally do the some good
 
 She said your papa is a good man and don't you kids forget it
 The whiskey's tryin' to ruin him but I know the Lord won't let it
 Then we sang Amazing Grace and Bringing In The Sheaves
 Rock of ages rock of ages left for me
 
 When I was a child my family would travel
 Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
 And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
 So many times that my memories are worn
 
 "And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
 Down by the green river where paradise lay?"
 "Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
 Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away"
 
 Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
 To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
 Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
 But empty pop bottles was all we would kill
 
 "And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
 Down by the green river where paradise lay?"
 "Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
 Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away"
 
 Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
 And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
 Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
 Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man
 
 "And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
 Down by the green river where paradise lay?"
 "Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
 Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away"
 
 When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
 Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
 I'll be halfway to Heaven with paradise waitin'
 Just five miles away from wherever I am
 
 "And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
 Down by the green river where paradise lay?"
 "Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
 Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away"
 
 When you looked into my eyes
 I stood there like I was hypnotised
 You sent a feeling to my spine
 A feeling warm and smooth and fine
 But all I could do were stand there paralyzed
 When we kissed, ooh what a thrill
 You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
 I felt like grabbin' you real tight
 Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
 But all I could do were stand there paralyzed
 
 Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing every day
 Ever since that day you came my way
 You made my life for me just one big happy game
 I'm gay every morning
 At night I'm still the same
 Do you remember that wonderful time
 You held my hand and swore that you'll be mine
 In front of preacher you said
 "I do" I couldn't say a word for thinking of you
 All I could do was stand there paralyzed.
 
 Your own personal Jesus
 Someone to hear your prayers
 Someone who cares
 
 Your own personal Jesus
 Someone to hear your prayers
 Someone who's there
 
 Feeling unknown
 And you're all alone
 Flesh and bone
 By the telephone
 Lift up the receiver
 I'll make you a believer
 
 Take second best
 Put me to the test
 Things on your chest
 You need to confess
 
 I will deliver
 You know I'm a forgiver
 
 Reach out and touch faith
 Reach out and touch faith
 
 Your own personal Jesus
 Someone to hear your prayers
 Someone who cares
 
 Your own personal Jesus
 Someone to hear your prayers
 Someone to care
 
 Feeling unknown
 And you're all alone
 Flesh and bone
 By the telephone
 Lift up the receiver
 I'll make you a believer
 
 I will deliver
 You know I'm a forgiver
 
 Reach out and touch faith
 Reach out and touch faith
 Reach out and touch faith
 Reach out and touch faith
 
 Those cotton fields were hot
 And that tractor never was my kind of livin'
 And when I hit sixteen
 I had my size and I hit the road to freedom
 
 And I'm glad I wasn't there to see my Momma
 'Cause she must've cried for hours
 I still hear her sayin' to me
 "Get your guitar and pick the Wildwood Flower'"
 
 Now Memphis was big
 And it was hard to find a job and so I didn't
 And it was easier to go back to the country
 And it was more like livin'
 
 Now, I've been down every road
 And I've stood on every porch where they were givin'
 And if they had a dime on an hour
 I would pick the Wildwood Flower
 
 It's hard to turn around
 And look back down the roads that I have traveled
 'Cause like a never endin' ball of twine
 My dreams have come unraveled
 
 Now as evening lays its shawl
 Across the shoulders of my life, I find
 I couldn't tie my life together
 With guitar strings and a poet's heartfelt mind
 
 And I'm glad I wasn't there to see my Momma
 'Cause she must've cried for hours
 I still hear her saying to me
 Get your guitar and pick the Wildwood Flower
 
 Play it like this, son
 
 I got cotton in the bottom land
 It's up and growin' and I got a good stand
 My good wife and them kids of mine
 Gonna get new shoes, come pickin' time
 Get new shoes come pickin' time
 
 Ev'ry night when I go to bed
 I thank the Lord that my kids are fed
 They live on beans eight days and nine
 But I get 'em fat come pickin' time
 Get 'em fat come come pickin' time
 
 The corn is yellow and the beans are high
 The sun is hot in the summer sky
 The work is hard til layin' by
 Layin' by til pickin' time
 Layin' by til pickin' time
 
 It's hard to see by the coal-oil light
 And I turn it off purty early at night
 'Cause a jug of coal-oil costs a dime
 But I stay up late come pickin' time
 Stay up late come pickin' time
 
 My old wagon barely gets me to town
 I patched the wheels and I watered 'em down
 Keep her in shape so she'll be fine
 To haul my cotton come pickin' time
 Haul my cotton come pickin' time
 
 Last Sunday mornin' when they passed the hat
 It was still nearly empty back where I sat
 But the preacher smiled and said that's fine
 The Lord'll wait til pickin' time
 The Lord'll wait til pickin' time
 
 From the day of your birth it's bread and water here on earth
 To a child of life to a child of life
 But there'll be pie in the sky by and by when I die and it'll be alright it'll be alright
 There'll be pie in the sky by and by when I die and it'll be alright it'll be alright
 
 Sometimes I doubt and fear that I've really gained salvation here
 For it's out of sight for it's out of sight
 
 But there'll be pie in the sky
 
 He said if I do his will there's a promise he'd fulfill
 And he's gone now to prepare be a mansion up there
 
 And there'll be pie in the sky
 There'll be pie in the sky
 There'll be pie in the sky.
 
 
 Well I see you got yourself a brand new harmonica
 Mail ordered from the Steagal's catalogue
 Boy I hope you can learn to play it like Lonnie Glossom
 And while you added you to oughta learn a verse or two
 Of Red River Valley Oh My Darling Clementine or Salty Dog
 Oh but please don't play Red River Valley
 And how about Polly Wolly doodle all day and see
 You know the only song I ever learned to play on my 2 dollar and 98 cent harmonica
 That I got from Wayne Raney in Clint Texas
 C-L-I-N-T Clint Texas was Red River Valley
 Then she said farewell to my french harp and me
 
 Well I see you're doin' pretty good on your new harmonica
 But don't you think you oughta learn about one more tune you know
 See you hold it like you's gonna eat a handful of popcorn
 And sometime you suck in and sometimes you blow
 But friend now please don't play Red River Valley
 And how about Polly Wolly doodle all day
 Like I said the only song I ever learnd
 On my 2 dollar and 98 cent harmonica that I got from Clint Texas
 From Wayne Raney in Clint Texas was Red River Valley
 Oh then she said farewell to my french harp and me
 
 Aurora borealis
 The icy sky at night
 Paddles cut the water
 In a long and hurried flight
 From the white man
 to the fields of green
 And the homeland
 we've never seen.
 
 They killed us in our tepee
 And they cut our women down
 They might have left some babies
 Cryin' on the ground
 But the firesticks
 and the wagons come
 And the night falls
 on the setting sun.
 
 They massacred the buffalo
 Kitty corner from the bank
 The taxis run across my feet
 And my eyes have turned to blanks
 In my little box
 at the top of the stairs
 With my Indian rug
 and a pipe to share.
 
 I wish a was a trapper
 I would give thousand pelts
 To sleep with Pocahontas
 And find out how she felt
 In the mornin'
 on the fields of green
 In the homeland
 we've never seen.
 
 And maybe Marlon Brando
 Will be there by the fire
 We'll sit and talk about Hollywood
 And the good things there for hire
 Like the Astrodome
 and the first tepee
 Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
 Marlon Brando, Pocahontas and me
 Pocahontas.
 
 A ship came in but it was empty
 And it sailed back out to sea again
 Now there's the sail on the horizon
 And now I wait until your ship comes in
 
 And I'll be waiting in the port of lonely hearts
 Watchin' for your topsail on the sea
 Prayin' that my ship of love will come
 To the port of lonely hearts where I will be
 
 I'll brave the storm until you're with me
 'Cause the wind and rain can't change a love that's true
 I'll be alone until you anchor
 And then I'll leave this lonely port with you
 
 Till then I'm waiting in the port of lonely hearts
 Watchin' for your topsail on the sea
 Prayin' that my ship of love will come
 To the port of lonely hearts where I will be
 
 Precious mem'ries unseen angel sent from somewhere to my soul
 How they linger ever near me and the sacred past unfolds
 Precious memories how they linger how they ever flood my soul
 In the stillness of the midnight precious sacred seems unfold
 
 Precious father loving mother fly across the lonely years
 And the old home scenes from my childhood in fond memory appear
 Precious memories how they linger...
 Precious memories flood my soul
 
 I walked through a county courthouse square
 On a park bench an old man was sitting there
 I said, your old courthouse is kinda run down
 He said, naw, it'll do for our little town
 I said, your old flagpole has leaned a little bit
 And that's a ragged old flag you got hanging on it
 
 He said, have a seat, and I sat down
 Is this the first time you've been to our little town?
 I said, I think it is
 He said, I don't like to brag
 But we're kinda proud of that ragged old flag
 
 You see, we got a little hole in that flag there when 
 Washington took it across the Delaware
 And it got powder-burned the night Francis Scott Key
 Sat watching it writing say can you see
 And it got a bad rip in New Orleans
 With Packingham and Jackson tuggin' at its seams
 
 And it almost fell at the Alamo
 Beside the texas flag, but she waved on though
 She got cut with a sword at Chancellorsville
 And she got cut again at Shiloh Hill
 There was Robert E. Lee, Beauregard, and Bragg
 And the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag
 
 On Flanders field in World War one
 She got a big hole from a Bertha gun
 She turned blood red in World War Two
 She hung limp and low a time or two
 She was in Korea and Vietnam
 She went where she was sent by Uncle Sam
 
 She waved from our ships upon the Briny foam
 And now they've about quit waving her back here at home
 In her own good land here she's been abused 
 She's been burned, dishonored, denied, and refused
 
 And the government for which she stands
 Is scandalized throughout the land
 And she's getting threadbare and wearing thin
 But she's in good shape for the shape she's in
 'Cause she's been through the fire before
 And I believe she can take a whole lot more
 
 So we raise her up every morning
 We take her down every night
 We don't let her touch the ground and we fold her up right
 On second thought, I do like to brag
 'Cause I'm mighty proud of that ragged old flag
 
 Well so long
 Oh how I hate to see you go
 Yes so long
 Oh how I hate to see you go
 Well the way that I will miss you
 I guess you'll never know
 
 We've been together so long
 To have to separate this way
 We've been together so long
 To have to separate this way
 Well I'm gonna let you go ahead on baby
 But let you come back home some day
 
 Play the blues boys, play the blues
 One more time
 
 You said you once had loved me
 But now I guess you've changed your mind
 You said you once had loved me
 But now I guess you've changed your mind
 Why don't you reconsider baby
 Give yourself just a little more time
 
 From the hands it came down
 From the side it came down
 From the feet it came down
 And ran to the ground
 Between heaven and hell
 A teardrop fell
 In the deep crimson dew
 The tree of life grew
 
 And the blood gave life
 To the branches of the tree
 And the blood was the price
 That set captives free
 And the numbers that came
 Through the fire and the flood
 Clung to the tree
 And were redeemed by the blood
 
 From the tree streamed a light
 That started the fight
 'Round the tree grew a vine
 On whose fruit I could dine
 My old friend Lucifer came
 Fought to keep me in chains
 But I saw through the tricks
 Of six-sixty-six
 
 And the blood gave life
 To the branches of the tree
 And the blood was the price
 That set captives free
 And the numbers that came
 Through the fire and the flood
 Clung to the tree
 And were redeemed by the blood
 
 From his hands it came down
 From his side it came down
 From his feet it came down
 And ran to the ground
 And a small inner voice
 Said "You do have a choice"
 The vine engrafted me
 And I clung to the tree
 
 And the blood gave life
 To the branches of the tree
 And the blood was the price
 That set captives free
 And with the numbers that came
 Through the fire and the flood
 I clung to the tree
 And were redeemed by the blood
 
 From his hands it came down
 From his side it came down
 From the feet it came down
 And ran to the ground
 
 I've wept for those who suffer long 
 But how I weep for those who've gone 
 Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong 
 But keep on killing 
 It's in the soul to feel such things 
 But weak to watch without speaking 
 Oh what mercy sadness brings 
 If God be willing 
 
 There is a train that's heading straight 
 To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate 
 And on the way, child and man
 And woman wait, watch and wait 
 For redemption day 
 
 Fire rages in the streets 
 And swallows everything it meets 
 It's just an image often seen 
 On television 
 Come leaders, come you men of great 
 Let us hear you pontificate 
 Your many virtues laid to waste 
 And we aren't listening 
 
 What do you have for us today 
 Throw us a bone but save the plate 
 On why we waited til so late 
 Was there no oil to excavate 
 No riches in trade for the fate 
 Of every person who died in hate 
 Throw us a bone, you men of great 
 
 There is a train that's heading straight 
 To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate 
 And on the way, child and man 
 And woman wait, watch and wait 
 For redemption day 
 
 It's buried in the countryside 
 It's exploding in the shells at night 
 It's everywhere a baby cries 
 Freedom
 
 Old pirates, yes, they rob I
 Sold I to the merchant ships
 Minutes after they took I
 From the bottomless pit
 But my hand was made strong
 By the hand of the Almighty
 We forward in this generation
 Triumphantly.
 Won't you help to sing
 These songs of freedom
 Cause all I ever have
 Redemption songs
 Redemption songs
 
 Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
 None but ourselves can free our minds
 Have no fear for atomic energy
 Cause none of them can stop the time
 How long shall they kill our prophets
 While we stand aside and look Ooh
 Some say it's just a part of it
 We've got to fulfill the book
 
 Won't you help to sing
 These songs of freedom
 Cause all I ever have
 Redemption songs
 Redemption songs
 Redemption songs
 
 Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
 None but ourselves can free our mind.
 Whoa! Have no fear for atomic energy
 Cause none of them-a can-a stop-a the time
 How long shall they kill our prophets
 While we stand aside and look
 Yes, some say it's just a part of it
 We've got to fulfill the book
 Won't you help to sing
 These songs of freedom
 Cause all I ever had
 Redemption songs
 All I ever had
 Redemption songs
 These songs of freedom
 Songs of freedom
 
 Never in this world before or nevermore hereafter
 Could a land know such a people
 As the pioneer, the cowboy
 His clothes, his conversation, his unique brand of lingo
 
 All his devil deeds of daring
 His hat, his bandana, the dirty boots
 And ragged chaps
 But mainly that sixgun dangling
 
 So his hand could get it quickly
 But draw your own conclusions
 Lean to your own understandings
 Your beliefs and your convictions
 
 Disprove any fact recorded in these sounds
 And songs and legends
 But I ask you if you do be sure
 You've walked in many moccasins
 
 Over many, many pathways
 And that you have listened carefully
 Really listened to the west wind
 And to everything it whispers
 
 And then go back and listen, listen to this once more
 To these legends and traditions
 They're only one reflection of a tick of time of that time
 Just ponder on the things that happened
 
 As we gaze so very deeply
 In the time and place and persons
 Seeing now and then the West as it really was
 And to tell you of a little that we saw there
 
 And looking backward through a century
 There was the True West there was the Real True West
 Not demanding an argument but rather hoping you looked with us
 And saw it as we saw it
 
 And heard that west wind screaming, shouting almost speaking
 Always whispering of these things we sang and spoke of
 And you'll hear perhaps the things the we said in the stories
 And the legends and traditions
 
 Through the wind that breeze these tales
 Of the ones who never made it
 Yet fighting heat and mountains plains and valleys, snow and hunger
 They went westward, westward, westward
 
 When you're all alone and blue
 No one to tell your troubles to
 Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
 
 When this world turns you down
 Not a true friend can be found
 Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
 
 And through all kinds of weather
 You'll find, I'll never change
 Through the sunshine and the shadows
 I'll always be the same
 
 We're together right or wrong
 Where you go I'll tag along
 Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
 
 And through all kinds of weather
 You'll find, I'll never change
 Through the sunshine and the shadows
 I'll always be the same
 
 We're together right or wrong
 Where you go I'll tag along
 Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
 
 A hundred and eighty were challenged by Travis to die 
 By the line that he drew with his sword when the battle was high 
 Any man that will fight to the death cross over 
 But if you want to live you'd better fly 
 And over the line went a hundred and seventy nine 
 Hey Santa Anna we're killing your soldiers below 
 That men wherever they go will remember the Alamo 
 Ol' Bowie lay dying his powder was ready and dry 
 Flat on his back Bowie killed them a few in reply 
 And young Davy Crockett was singing and laughing with gallantry fears in his eyes 
 For God and for freedom a man more than willing to die 
 Hey Santa Anna... 
 They sent a young scout from the battlements bloody and loud 
 With the words of farewell from a garrison valiant and proud 
 Grieve not little darling my dying if Texas is sovereign and free 
 We'll never surrender and ever with liberty be 
 Hey Santa Anna...
 
 I came in like a restless wind
 On a wagon train
 But I'm going to go like a July snow
 Back to where I came from
 Going to leave this humdrum
 It's too slow and tame
 
 None of your business where I've been
 Don't ask me what I've done
 Run your ranch and punch your cows
 And stay behind my gun man
 Colorado's right hand will put you on the run
 
 I got a gal in Denver town
 That's crying over me
 But I said goodbye and I let her cry
 I miss her company but
 I'll get out of this rut
 Rio Bravo's killing me
 
 They got a man locked in a cell
 That's a freer man than I
 He's going to laugh right in their face
 When they lead him out to die and
 He's going to leave these badlands
 And ride off in the sky
 
 You're going to see old Colorado
 Heading for the door
 You better believe I'm going to leave
 Like the 904 train
 Going to breathe some air again
 That ain't been breathed before
 
 Ride this train up and down and across a strange wonderful land 
 It's almost like a fairyland when you to think about it 
 You go through places with names like Tuscaloosa Kokomo Muskogee Oshkosh Saginaw 
 Eureka Bandera Battle Creek Sioux City Chattanooga 
 Hattiesburg Lynchburg and Baltinare Arkansas 
 You see I'm a million different people from all over the world 
 And I've been coming to this country for hundreds of years 
 This was the Promised Land for me 
 But let's not forget that when I came here 
 There were already millions of people living in teepees along the rivers 
 And hunting deer and buffalo for food and shelter 
 And it's with a little regret that I think of how I pushed them back 
 And crowded them out to claim this land for myself or for another country 
 But the Indians' hearts must have been full of music 
 For they left names with me that seem to sing 
 Names like Mohawk Mandan Kickapoo Cree Yacoma Seminole Crow Shawnee 
 Choctaw Delaware Fox Paiute Winnebago Cheyenne Blackfoot 
 Navajo Ute Comanche Quapaw Creek Apache Sioux Chippewa 
 Ardua Hupa Shoshone Mow Hicano Sage Menomini 
 Shinouk Arapaho Nez Perce Iroquois Pony Cutenai 
 Flathead Chickasaw Pueblo Yuma Pima Pomo Caddo 
 Well a lot of them are still with me and I'm glad 
 It's for sure their names will always be with me 
 But let's look a little at the heart and muscle of this land 
 Few things you don't read in books things that aren't taught in school 
 Now you take this little town we're goin' through here this is Beach Creek Kentucky 
 And right down there in the valley that's where our house used to be 
 It was a little shotgun shack with a spring out back 
 And a smokehouse and another little bitty house and that's about all 
 My pa was a coalminer like most everybody in Mulengerg County 
 Worked in the mines all his life 
 I guess he didn't have much ambition to do anything else 
 Cause they say coalmining kinda gets in your blood 
 Matter of fact pa said if they ever drained the blood out of him 
 It would be blacker than black strap moulesen 
 When I was a kid I used to sit at the fireplace there with mom 
 And wait on pa to get in from the mine 
 And we'd sure get anxious if he was ever late 
 Ma would rock back and forth and watch the clock listin' for pa to hit the front porch 
 Then he'd come in nothin' clean but the whites of his eyes 
 And he'd reach for that lie-soap and starts scrubbin' 
 And I'd stand back and watch him and say to myself 
 Boy I'll be glad when I get big enough to work in the mines
 
 Ride this train to any little trail in the West you may find me riding alone late at night 
 My poor old horse don't understand why I ride at night and sleep in the daytime 
 Or why we ride in the bushes and hide every time I hear a noise 
 Well that's all I've done for months now running and hiding 
 You see my name is John Wesley Hardin no I'm not proud of the name anymore 
 They say I've killed forty men they tell a lot of different stories about me 
 Of course I guess I'm to blame for a lot of it 
 I killed the first time when I was fifteen to save my life but then I had to do it again 
 Then every bum in the country that was fast with the gun started lookin' for me 
 They called me the fastest gun alive and I guess I was fast or I wouldn't be alive now 
 I got to where I couldn't walk down a street or in a saloon 
 Without some trigger-happy cowpoke 
 Wantin' to prove he could outdraw old John Wesley Hardin 
 Maybe I got a little bitter and didn't care whether I killed or not for a while 
 And I never quite forgot when the authorities in Huntsville prison 
 Dragged me up in the snow naked and horsewhipped me 
 Well that's why I'm ridin' at night I want to go where no one has ever seen me 
 Where I won't even have to wear a gun 
 Maybe I'll settle down in a quiet little town somewhere 
 Even get a job on the right side of the law who knows 
 Maybe in a new town the people will let me forget
 
 Ride this train to Roseburg Oregon now there's a town for you 
 And you talk about rough 
 You know a lot of places in the country claim Paul Bunyon lived there 
 But you should have seen Roseburg when me and my daddy'd come there 
 Everyone of them loggers looked like Paul Bunyon to me 
 As I was a skinny kid about sixteen 
 And I was scared to death when we walked into that camp 
 None of the lumberjacks paid any attention to me at first 
 But when my pa told the boss that me and him wanted a job 
 A lot of 'em stopped their work to see what was gonna happen 
 That big boss walked around me looked me up and down and said 
 Mister I believe that boy is made out of second growth timber and I guess I was Everybody but me and pa had a big laugh over it 
 Pa got kinda mad and the boss finally said he might start me out as a high climber 
 I didn't know what a high climber was boy I sure learned fast 
 That steel corded rope cut my back and that axe 
 I thought it was gonna break my arms off but I stuck with it 
 It wasn't long till I learned that a man's got to be 
 A lot tougher than the timber he's cuttin' 
 Finally I could swing that crosscut saw with the best of them
 
 Ride this train to Bogaloosa Louisiana see these swamps and forest 
 Man's never set foot in a lot of it 
 You'll find aligator mink coon possum squirrel otter and the lakes're full of fish 
 You'll find places so virgin and fresh 
 That you'd think the Lord just created it yesterday 
 As a matter of fact some people say when this world was made 
 A whole lot of it just must have looked like southern Louisiana does now 
 In 1788 I left Halifax Nova Scotia with about two hundred other Acadians 
 We made a long tiring journey south 
 In our party of two hundred there was this beautiful girl 
 That I just haven't quite been able to forget 
 Dorraine was her name and Dorraine and I were 
 Well we were kinda pledged to each other 
 And then we said when we got to the promised land 
 We'd build us a house and someday we'd have 
 The biggest sugar-cane plantation in the country 
 And I used to make Dorraine blush 
 When I'd tell her we'd raise the biggest family in the country too
 
 Ride this train to Pionridge Mississippi see that levee there 
 It's built to hold back the waters of Ol' Man River when he gets on a rampage 
 And he gets on a rampage believe me 
 One of these days he's gonna come right over that levee 
 And we're gonna have to head for the hills again 
 And you know how that levee was built Mister 
 Not with machines it is built with elbow grease 
 They got the men off the farms out of the houses 
 Even out of the honky tonks on Saturday night 
 I don't hardly know how it happened to me it happens fast 
 I just remember I was in the Green Lantern in Natchez one Saturday night 
 And somebody pulled a knife and somebody threw the bottle 
 And the next thing I knew I had a chain on my leg and a shovel in my hand 
 It seemed like the whole world come down on me 
 They whipped us like miles and when they did feed us 
 There was always a fight or a killin' over who's gonna get the biggest piece of meet 
 Whereas the boss man did't care about the killin' 
 That is less you killed a good worker then you get killed 
 If you complain about anything he just liable to give you a chance to get away 
 You know what I mean 
 They take the chains off your legs and beg you to run so they can shoot you
 
 Ride this train to any country fair in this land now here's a hard working happy people 
 Mrs Jones baked the finest pie for the contest this year 
 And Mr Brown's got the biggest fattest old sow you ever saw 
 And all the kids are eatin' popcorn and cotton candy 
 This is Chester South Carolina and that year at the fair 
 My papa brought us all down in a wagon 
 And on the way down we picked up another family that lived up the creek 
 I was just a little boy but I remember I kept askin' papa 
 How much farther is it how much farther is it 
 We had a young haffa tied to the wagon that papa just knew 
 Was gonna take first prize 
 I didn't have no doubt about that haffa winning first prize 
 But the main thing I was interested in 
 Was somethin' else papa had under his seat at the front of the wagon 
 And that was an old dobro that I thought papa played like nobody else in the world 
 I guess by real musical standards papa didn't know much about music 
 But I tell you that night at the fair when he played in the dance band 
 I just had to stay awake sat up there and listen to papa play the dobro
 
 Ride this train to Dyess Arkansas see this cottonland 
 Some of us are so poor now you'd have to sell 'em a sack of fertilizer 
 To raise an umbrella 
 They grade the cotton according to the length and strength of the fibre 
 And they been raisin' a lot of fair to middlin' grade here which ain't good 
 But there was a time 
 Yeah there was a time when the cotton grew tall 
 Not far from here I had the finest plantation you ever saw 
 About 600 acres of the finest cottonland in the country 
 Now I believe this was about 1855 and I had a bumper crop that year 
 I had the best bunch of slaves you ever saw and I treated 'em right 
 Well a lot of em even stayed with me after the war 
 But gettin' back to what I was gonna tell you 
 See I have a rule that all the slaves got to be back in out of the fields 
 And accounted for by sundown every day 
 And one day when they came in there was one short 
 Well I found out right away that it was old uncle Moses that was missin' 
 And figured that somethin' might have happened to him old as he was 
 So I went out into the cottonfield to look for him 
 Well uncle Moses was way down at the end of the road sittin' on his cottonsack 
 Well I walked up and said Uncle Moses don't you know the rule 
 That you're supposed to be punished if you're not back in and accounted for by dark 
 And he said Boss Jack I know that sir 
 But I was pickin' along on my road 
 And all of a sudden somethin' seemed to come over me 
 And the finest words started comin' through my head and the finest music 
 So I rememorized them words and that music till I had it all in my head 
 Now that I got the song all through I guess Boss Jack 
 I was ready to take my punishment 
 Well I didn't hardly know what to say 
 But I asked Uncle Moses to sing that song for me 
 And he stood up there and for the first time he sang Swing Low Sweet Chariot 
 Well after that I kinda laid old Uncle Moses off and let him peddle around the house 
 And every night at dark you could hear him sing 
 And he sang another song once in a while that made me feel awful proud
 
 Ride this train let me show you a land of rolling hills and tall corn 
 A land of hard working people where rewards are often very small 
 This is Pella Iowa 
 My mother and father brought me here in 1847 we came from Cork Ireland 
 We had a potato famine over there and things had been pretty rough for us 
 I remember during the potato famine in Ireland I'd trail along at father's feet 
 And we'd try to find enough potatoes for a meal 
 And we'd take em back in to mother and she'd cook em coats and all 
 Well finally we gave up and somehow we made it to America 
 Well our new neighbors here in Pella loaned father oxen 
 And ploughs to make his first crop with 
 And you never saw taller corn that year than it was on our place 
 The next season why we were even lendin' out ploughs and oxen to other farms 
 That's the way it was here in the new land 
 Everybody helped everybody out if you got sick everybody came to visit 
 Even the doctor wouldn't take pay if he thought you couldn't afford it 
 But old Doc Brown was always there if you ever needed him
 
 Love is a burnin' thing
 And it makes a fiery ring
 Bound by wild desire
 I fell into a ring of fire
 
 I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
 I went down, down, down
 And the flames went higher
 And it burns, burns, burns
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 
 I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
 I went down, down, down
 And the flames went higher
 And it burns, burns, burns
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 
 The taste of love is sweet
 When hearts like ours meet
 I fell for you like a child
 Oh, but the fire went wild
 
 I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
 I went down, down, down
 And the flames went higher
 And it burns, burns, burns
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 
 I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
 I went down, down, down
 And the flames went higher
 And it burns, burns, burns
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 And it burns, burns, burns
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 The ring of fire
 
 Love is a burnin' thing
 And it makes a fiery ring
 Bound by wild desire
 I fell into a ring of fire
 
 I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
 I went down, down, down
 And the flames went higher
 And it burns, burns, burns
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 
 I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
 I went down, down, down
 And the flames went higher
 And it burns, burns, burns
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 
 The taste of love is sweet
 When hearts like ours meet
 I fell for you like a child
 Oh, but the fire went wild
 
 I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
 I went down, down, down
 And the flames went higher
 And it burns, burns, burns
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 
 I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
 I went down, down, down
 And the flames went higher
 And it burns, burns, burns
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 And it burns, burns, burns
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 The ring of fire, the ring of fire
 The ring of fire
 
 The father heard church bells at midnight a wrong time for church bells to chime 
 He went to the tower found a little girl there said why ring the bells at this time 
 I'm just ringing the bells for Jim please father ringing the bells for Jim 
 I'm sorry I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin' so I'm ringing the bells for Jim 
 Please father pray for him this Christmas he's sick and he's in so much pain 
 The doctors all say he'll be gone any day so I must ring the bells again 
 I'm just ringing the bells... 
  
 On the day after Christmas she brought him said father heed little Jim 
 You see he got well when he heard the church bells I was ringing the bells for Jim 
 I'm just ringing the bells... 
 
 'Cause it's Saturday night and I just got paid
 Fool about my money don't try to save
 My heart says go, go
 Have a time 'cause it's Saturday night
 And I'm feelin' fine

 I'm gonna rip it up
 I'm gonna shake it up
 I'm gonna ball it up
 I'm gonna ride it out
 And ball tonight
 
 I got a date and I won't be late

 When the music starts jumpin'
 I'll have a ball
 
 I'm gonna rock it up
 I'm gonna rip it up
 I'm gonna shake it up
 I'm gonna ball it up
 I'm gonna ride it out
 And ball tonight
 
 Along about 10 I'll be flying high
 Rocking on out into the sky

 'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul

 Well, I took my Ruby jukin' on the out-skirts of town
 She took her high heels off and rolled her stockings down
 She put a quarter in the jukebox to get a little beat
 Everybody started watchin', all the rhythm in her feet
 
 She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
 Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
 When Ruby starts a-rockin'
 Boy, it satisfies my soul
 
 Now, Ruby started rockin' 'bout one o'clock
 And when she started rockin'
 She just couldn't stop, she rocked on the tables
 And rolled on the floor, and everybody yelled
 "Ruby, rock some more"
 
 She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
 Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
 When Ruby starts a-rockin'
 Boy, it satisfies my soul
 
 It was 'round about four, I thought she would stop
 She looked at me and then she looked at the clock
 She said, "Wait a minute, Daddy
 Now don't get sour, all I want to do
 Is rock a little bit more"
 
 She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
 Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
 When Ruby starts a-rockin'
 Boy, it satisfies my soul
 
 One night, my Ruby left me all alone
 I tried to contact her on the telephone
 I finally found her about twelve o'clock
 She said, "Leave me alone, Daddy
 'Cause your Ruby wants to rock"
 
 She's my rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
 Rock and roll Ruby, rock and roll
 When Ruby starts a-rockin'
 Boy, it satisfies my soul
 
 Rock, rock, rock and roll
 Rock, rock, rock and roll
 Rock, rock, rock and roll
 Rock, rock, rock and roll
 When Ruby starts a-rockin'
 Boy, it satisfies my soul
 
 It seems like yesterday
 I heard the people say
 Son you were born to stray
 Someday you'll settle down
 I guess there'll come a time
 Maybe I'll tow the line
 Right now I'm doing fine
 Rolling from town to town
 
 I don't care where I ride
 I'll let my feet decide
 Do anything but don't ask that I
 Hang up my rock and roll shoes
 Hang up my rock and roll shoes
 
 Guitars and ringing tones
 In my blood and in my bones
 Show me a bus
 And I'll call it home
 'Cause I don't wanna change
 
 I don't care where I ride
 I'll let my feet decide
 Do anything but don't ask that I
 Hang up my rock and roll shoes
 Hang up my rock and roll shoes
 
 On a lonely day
 When they put me in my grave
 Ain't a worry you need to save
 Just hang up my rock and roll shoes
 
 So let that motor run
 Headed out towards the sun
 I'm in the mood for moving on
 But I'll be back someday
 
 I don't care where I ride
 I'll let my feet decide
 Do anything but don't ask that I
 Hang up my rock and roll shoes
 
 Now, this here's the story about the Rock Island Line
 Well, The Rock Island line, she runs down into New Orleans
 There's a big toll gate down there
 And, y' know, if you got certain things on board
 When you go through the toll gate
 Well you don't have to pay the man no toll
 Well, the train driver, he pulled up to the toll gate
 and The man hollered and asked him what all he had on board, and he said
 I got livestock, I got livestock
 I got cows, I got pigs, I got sheep, I got mules, I got all livestock
 Well, he said, you're alright, boy
 You don't have to pay no toll
 You can just go right on through
 So, he went on through the toll gate, and as he went through
 He started picking up a little bit of speed
 Picking up a little bit of steam
 He got on through he turned a look back to the man, he said
 Well, I fooled you, I fooled you
 I got pig iron, I got pig iron
 I got all pig iron

 that There were two more drinks that he'd like to try,
 Conductor said 'what could they be'
 'a hot cup of coffee and cold glass of tea'
 
 Well, the Rock Island Line she's a mighty good road
 Rock Island Line, it's a road to ride
 Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
 Well, if you could ride you gotta ride like you find it
 Get your ticket at the station called the Rock Island Line
 
 Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee 
 Let the water and the blood from Thy wounded side which fload 
 Thee of sin the double cure save from raft and make me pure 
 
 Let me hide myself in Thee 
 
 In my hand no prize I bring simply to Thy cross I cling 
 
 While I draw this pleading breath when my eyes shall close in death 
 Lord when I rise to world unknown and behold the on Thy throne 
 Rock of ages cleft for me let me hime myself in Thee 
 Let me hide myself in Thee
 
 I took a tour to Texas
 And from Waco I called you
 But day by day, no answer
 And I'm Big Bluebonnet blue
 
 I'm singing and they're dancing
 But I'm feeling Big D bad
 I'm Sweetwater beat
 And I'm Texas City sad
 
 The rhythm keeps me living
 But have you heard the news
 There's a sad song singer coming
 With the rockabilly blues
 
 It's hard to keep on singing
 When you're lonesome to the bone
 Ten thousand happy people but I'm San Antone alone
 One night stands and the man demands
 
 That I get up and go
 I'm Odessa desperate
 And San Angelo low
 
 The rhythm keeps me living
 But have you heard the news
 There's a sad song singer coming
 With the rockabilly blues
 
 It's the same old tune in Temple
 About the loving I ain't had
 I'm getting Beaumont bitter
 And Amarillo mad
 
 I'm giving up on calling you
 'Cause you're evading me
 I'm coming home and if you're gone
 I'm gonna be Tennessee free
 
 The rhythm keeps me living
 And have you heard the news
 There's a sad song singer coming
 With the rockabilly blues
 
 We're the best partners this world's ever seen,
 Together as close as can be.
 Sometimes it's hard to find time in between,
 To tell you what you are to me.
 
 You are the rose of my heart,
 You are the love of my life.
 A flower not fading nor falling apart,
 If you're tired, rest your head on my arm.
 Rose of my heart.
 
 When sorrow holds you in her arms of clay,
 It's rain drops that fall from your eyes.
 Your smile's like the sun come to earth for a day,
 You brighten my blackest of skies.
 
 You are the rose of my heart,
 You are the love of my life.
 A flower not fading nor falling apart,
 If you're cold, let my love make you warm.
 Rose of my heart.
 
 So hard times or easy times, what do I care,
 There's nothing I'd change if I could.
 The tears and the laughter are things that we share,
 Your hand in mine makes all times good.
 
 You are the rose of my heart,
 You are the love of my life.
 A flower not fading nor falling apart,
 You're my harbor in life's restless storm.Rose of my heart.
 
 Rose of my heart.
 
 Born to be a roughneck I'll never amount to nothin' 
 Pullin' case and layin' pipe is hard labor 
 Well I was born in a boomer shack bout a half mile from town 
 Papa was a driller on a wildcat crew and my mama never was around 
 I learn to cuss when I was two and fight when I was three 
 And by the time I was five there was no kid alive could ever get the best of me 
 Born to be a roughneck... 
  
 Well I started workin' like a regular man when I was just about knee high 
 Skinning the knuckles with my two bare hands but they never heard me cry 
 I remember walkin' down the road and hearin' somebody say 
 He was born to live a rougneck's life and he's never gonna change his ways 
 Born to be a roughneck... 
 Born to be a roughneck...
 
 
 Rowboat
 Row me to the shore
 She don't
 Wanna be my friend no more
 She dug a hole
 In the bottom of my soul
 She don't
 Wanna be my friend no more
 
 Pick me up
 Gimme some food to eat
 In your truck
 Goin' no place
 I'll be home
 Talkin' to nobody
 You'll be strange
 You'll be far away
 
 Big fat moon
 And my body's out of tune
 With my burnin' ways
 She's a billion years away
 Dog food on the floor
 And I've been like this before
 She is all
 And everything else is small
 
 Pick me up
 Gimme some alcohol
 In your truck
 Playin' the radio
 I'll be home
 With the gasoline
 You'll be stoned
 You'll be far away
 
 Rowboat
 Row me to the shore
 She don't
 Wanna be my friend no more
 She dug a hole
 In the bottom of my soul
 She is all
 And everything else is small
 
  
 Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep run softly Blue River run cool and deep 
 Oh I thrill to her kisses and she thrills to mine 
 Run softly while she sleeps and dreams for a time 
 'Cause she dreams of tomorrow when she'll be my wife 
 And I pray that as peaceful as you is our life 
 And if your murmuring soothes me till I'm sleeping too 
 Run softly Blue River we'll both dream with you 
  
 Oh I thrill to her kisses... 
 (Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep
 run softly Blue River run cool and deep) 
 (Run softly Blue River my darlin's asleep 
 run softly Blue River run cool and deep)
 
 You wired me awake
 And hit me with a hand of broken nails
 You tied my lead and pulled my chain
 To watch my blood begin to boil
 
 But I'm gonna break
 I'm gonna break my
 I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
 
 I'm gonna break
 I'm gonna break my
 I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
 
 Too cold to start a fire
 I'm burning diesel, burning dinosaur bones
 I'll take the river down to still waters
 And ride a pack of dogs
 
 I'm gonna break
 I'm gonna break my
 I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
 
 I'm gonna break
 I'm gonna break my
 I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
 
 When the forest burns along the road
 Like God's eyes in my headlights
 When the dogs are looking for their bones
 And it's raining icepicks on your steel shore
 
 I'm gonna break
 I'm gonna break my
 I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
 
 I'm gonna break
 I'm gonna break my
 I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
 
 I'm gonna break
 I'm gonna break my
 I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
 
 I'm gonna break
 I'm gonna break my
 I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
 
 I was born in Saginaw, Michigan
 And I grew up in a house on Saginaw Bay
 My daddy was a poor hard working Saginaw fisherman
 Too many times he came home with too little pay
 
 I loved a girl in Saginaw, Michigan
 She was the daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man
 But he called me, "That son of a Saginaw fisherman"
 And not good enough to ever claim his daughter's hand
 
 That's why I'm up here in Alaska looking around for gold
 Like a crazy fool I'm a digging in the frozen ground, so cold
 But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
 I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan
 
 I wrote my love in Saginaw, Michigan
 I said, "Honey, I'm a coming home, please wait for me
 And you can tell your dad that I'm coming back a richer man
 I've hit the biggest strike in Klondike history"
 
 Her dad met the bus in Saginaw, Michigan
 And he gave me a great big party with champagne
 Then he said, "Son, you're wise, young ambitious man
 Why don't you sell your father-in-law your Klondike claim?"
 
 Now he's up there in Alaska digging in the cold, cold ground
 That greedy fool is a looking for the gold I never found
 But it serves him right and nobody here is missing him
 Least of all the newly-weds of Saginaw, Michigan
 
 Standing on the corner with the lowdown blues
 A great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
 Honey let me be your salty dog
 
 Let me be your salty dog
 Or I won't be your little man at all
 Honey let me be your salty dog
 
 Look it here Sal, I know you
 Run down stocking and a wore out shoe
 Honey let me be your salty dog
 
 Let me be your salty dog
 Or I won't be your little man at all
 Honey let me be your salty dog
 
 Down in the wildwood sitting on a log
 Finger on the trigger and an eye on the hog
 Honey let me be your salty dog
 
 Let me be your salty dog
 Or I won't be your little man at all
 Honey let me be your salty dog
 
 Well I Pulled the trigger and the gun set go
 The shot gun over in Mexico
 Honey let me be your salty dog
 
 Let me be your salty dog
 Or I won't be your little man at all
 Honey let me be your salty dog
 
 Salty down now
 
 Let me be your salty dog
 Or I won't be your little man at all
 Honey let me be your salty dog
 
 Let me be your salty dog
 Or I won't be your little man at all
 Honey let me be your salty dog
 
 Well, my name it is Sam Hall, Sam Hall.
 Yes, my name it is Sam Hall, it is Sam Hall.
 My name it is Sam Hall an' I hate you, one and all.
 An' I hate you, one and all
 Damn your eyes.
 
 I killed a man, they said, so they said.
 I killed a man, they said, so they said.
 I killed a man, they said an' I smashed in his head.
 An' I left him laying dead,
 Damn his eyes.
 
 But a-swinging, I must go, I must go.
 A-swinging, I must go, I must go.
 A-swinging, I must go while you critters down below,
 Yell up, "Sam, I told you so."
 Well, damn your eyes!
 
 I saw Molly in the crowd, in the crowd.
 I saw Molly in the crowd, in the crowd.
 I saw Molly in the crowd an' I hollered, right out loud
 "Hey there Molly, ain't you proud?
 "Damn your eyes."
 
 Then the Sheriff, he came to, he came to.
 Ah, yeah, the Sheriff, he came to, he came to.
 The Sheriff, he come to an he said, "Sam, how are you?"
 An I said, "Well, Sheriff, how are you?"
 "Damn your eyes."
 
 My name is Samuel, Samuel.
 My name is Samuel, Samuel.
 My name is Samuel, an' I'll see you all in hell.
 An' I'll see you all in hell,
 Damn your eyes.
 
 Deep within my heart lies a melody
 A song of old San Antone
 Where in dreams I live with a memory
 Beneath the stars all alone
 It was there I found beside the Alamo
 Enchantment strange as the blue up above
 A moonlit pass that only she would know
 Still hears my broken song of love
 Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
 Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
 Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
 Speak once again of my love, my own.
 Broken song, empty words I know
 Still live in my heart all alone
 For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
 And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
 Deep within my heart lies a melody,
 A song of old San Antone
 Where in dreams I live with a memory
 Beneath the stars all alone
 It was there I found beside the Alamo
 Enchantment strange as the blue up above
 A moonlit pass that only she would know
 Still hears my broken song of love
 Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
 Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
 Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
 Speak once again of my love, my own.
 Broken song, empty words I know
 Still live in my heart all alone
 For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
 And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
 
 I was thinking about you guy yesterday
 I've been here three times before, and
 I think I understand a little bit how you feel about some things
 It's none of my business how you feel about some other things
 And I don't give a damn about how you feel about some of the things
 
 But anyways
 I try to put myself in your place
 And I believe this is the way that I would feel about San Quentin
 
 San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
 You've hosted me since nineteen-sixty-three
 I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen 'em die
 And long ago I stopped askin' why
 
 San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
 You've cut me and have scarred me through and through
 And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
 Mister Congressman, you can't understand
 
 San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
 Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
 You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
 And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold
 
 San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
 May your walls fall down and may I live to tell
 May all the world forget you ever stood
 And may all the world regret you did no good
 
 San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
 
 Thank you very much
  one more time?
 Hey, before we do it, if uh
 Any of the guards are still speaking to me, could I have a glass of water?
 
 Have a little drink
 No, thank you, brother
 Want to get rich?
 Don't need it brother
 
 Wanna fool around?
 No, thank you sister
 Ain't you heard that
 That old evil man within me died?
 
 Let's have a party
 I ain't going
 What you gonna do?
 Gonna keep praying
 
 And keep working out my salvation
 Trying to get sanctified
 No more condemnation, repented
 Jesus brought salvation, He saved me
 Justification brought me safely to His side
 
 And as I get to know Him more
 He gives me a taste of the coming glory
 And I'm trying to whip the devil
 I'm trying to get sanctified
 
 Sanctified, sanctified
 I'm working to whip the devil
 I'm trying to get sanctified
 
 Don't go to church
 Yes, I'm going
 Why you read that old Bible?
 'Cause I like it
 Well, I don't believe in God
 Well, God bless you
 You ain't got no argument
 For what I feel inside
 
 Aw, have a little fun
 That's what I'm having
 Life's passing you by
 I can hardly wait
 
 Well, I've got my mind set upon eternity
 Trying to get sanctified
 And there's no more condemnation, I repented
 Jesus brought salvation, He saved me
 Justification brought me safely to His side
 
 And as I get to know Him more
 He gives me a taste of the coming glory
 And I'm trying to whip the devil
 Trying to get sanctified
 
 Sanctified, sanctified
 Sanctified, sanctified
 Yes, I'm trying to whip the devil
 I'm trying to get sanctified
 
 Sanctified, sanctified
 Sanctified, sanctified
 I'm working out my salvation
 Trying to get sanctified
 Sanctified
 
 One, two, one, two, three, four
 The lights in the harbor
 Don't shine for me
 I'm like a lost ship adrift on the sea
 
 The sea of heartbreak
 Lost love and loneliness
 Memories of your caress
 So divine how I wish you were mine
 Again my dear
 I am on this sea of tears
 Sea of heartbreak
 
 Oh how did I lose you
 Oh where did I fail
 Why did you leave me
 Always to sail
 
 The sea of heartbreak
 Lost love and loneliness
 Memories of your caress
 So divine how I wish you were mine
 Again my dear
 I am on this sea of tears
 Sea of heartbreak
 
 Oh what I'd give just to sail back to shore
 Back to your arms once more
 
 Come to my rescue
 Oh, come here to me
 Take me and keep me
 Away from the sea
 
 The sea of heartbreak
 Lost love and loneliness
 Memories of your caress
 So divine how I wish you were mine
 Again my dear
 I am on this sea of tears
 Sea of heartbreak
 
 Sea of heartbreak
 Sea of heartbreak
 Sea of heartbreak
 
 As the bible is laid open
 And the bread of life I find
 In the words that you have spoken
 Seal it in my heart and mind
 
 Seal it in my heart and mind Lord
 Seal it in my heart and mind
 Let me always take it with me
 Seal it in my heart and mind
 
 I find prove of your forgiveness
 And what wisdom there I find
 And the strenght for daily living
 Seal it in my heart and mind
 
 Seal it in my heart and mind Lord
 Seal it in my heart and mind
 Let me always take it with me
 Seal it in my heart and mind
 
 Words of love and inspiration
 Light to guide me when I'm blind
 Keep me filled in preparation
 Seal it in my heart and mind
 
 Seal it in my heart and mind Lord
 Seal it in my heart and mind
 Let me always take it with me
 Seal it in my heart and mind
 
 The seasons come the seasons go we get a little sunshine rain and snow 
 Just the way that it was planned to be 
 But there's no seasons in my heart while you play the leading part 
 Cause the flowers will bloom eternally 
 Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow and my tears like withered leaves will fall 
 But spring could bring some glad tomorrow and darling we could be happy after all 
 
 As it is in nature's plan no season get the upper hand 
 How I try to keep this fact in mind 
 The trees are bare the cold wind blows and by experience we should know 
 Winter comes but the spring is close behind 
 Your leaving will bring
 
 I walked up to the desk and asked the man about a room
 I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
 Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
 I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
 Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
 But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
 
 I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
 But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
 The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
 And I'm alone on our second honeymoon
 
 I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
 The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
 The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss
 Two loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss
 We'd said that we'd return to live it over in this room
 But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
 
 Well I new someday, Ruby would be leavin'
 That she wasn't happy livin' quietly, quietly
 'Cause she would get the bedroom look each mornin'
 And I felt Ruby pull away from me
 
 Yeah, so go downtown about nine o'clock this evening
 Walk under that red light and down the hall, down the hall
 Look for the highest flyin' girl, that's Ruby
 And if you wait your turn you'll see Ruby fall
 
 Don't let her know that you even know me
 She'll be tryin' to forget it all
 And don't tell me how is was tonight, tomorrow
 'Cause I don't want to see Ruby fall
 
 I didn't hold her back, when she got restless
 One man is not enough when she wants it all
 Yeah, I let her go when I saw what she wanted
 'Cause I don't care to see Ruby fall
 
 After seven years behind these bars together
 I'll miss you more than a brother when you go when you go
 If only I had not tried to escape
 They'd barred me with you I know yes I know
 
 Won't you tell the folks back home I'll soon be coming
 And don't let them know I never will be free be free
 Sometimes write and tell me how they're doing
 And send a picture of mother back to me
 
 Say hello to Dad and shake his poor hardworking hand
 And send a picture of mother if you can
 
 I'm happy for you that you got your freedom
 But stay with me just another minute or so or so
 After all this sweating blood together
 Who'll be my fighting partner when you go when you go
 
 The hardest time will be on Sunday morning
 Church bells will ring on Heaven Hill Heaven Hill
 Please ask Reverend Garrett to pray for me
 And send a picture of mother if you will
 
 Say hello to Dad and shake his poor hardworking hand
 And send a picture of mother if you can
 
 There's a cross above the baby's bed,
 A Savior in her dreams.
 But she was not delivered then,
 And the baby became me.
 There's a light inside the darkened room,
 A footstep on the stair.
 A door that I forever close,
 To leave those memories there.
 
 So when the shadows link them,
 Into an evening sun.
 Well first there's summer, then I'll let you in.
 September when it comes.
 
 I plan to crawl outside these walls,
 Close my eyes and see.
 And fall into the heart and arms,
 
 Of those who wait for me.
 I cannot move a mountain now
 I can no longer run.
 I cannot be who I was then
 In a way, I never was.
 
 I watch the clouds go sailing
 I watch the clock and sun.
 Oh, I watch myself, depending on,
 September when it comes.
 
 So when the shadows link them,
 And burn away the clouds.
 They will fly me, like an angel,
 To a place where I can rest.
 When this begins, I'll let you know,
 September when it comes.
 
 Comb your hair and paint and powder
 You act proud and I'll act prouder
 You sing loud and I'll sing louder
 Tonight we're setting the woods on fire
 
 You my gal and I'm your feller
 Dress up in your frock of yeller
 You'll look swell honey, but I'll look sweller
 Setting the woods on fire
 
 We'll take in all the honky tonks
 Tonight we're having fun
 I'll show the folks a brand new dance
 That never has been done
 
 Hey, look a here baby
 Everything is fine
 Gonna sip up a little of wine
 Gonna make a little doggone time
 Setting the woods on fire
 
 You'll gas up my hot rod stocker
 We'll get hotter than a poker
 I'll be broke and you'll be broker
 Tonight we're setting the woods on fire
 
 We'll sit close to one another
 Up the one street and down the other
 We'll have a time o brother
 Setting the woods on fire
 
 We'll set aside a little time
 To fix a flat or two
 My tires and tubes are doing fine
 But the air is showing through
 
 We'll sit close to one another
 Up the one street and down the other
 We'll have a time o brother
 Setting the woods on fire
 
 I live down in Shantytown
 Where chicken's twenty cents a pound
 And if you live on such solid ground
 Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown?
 Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown?
 
 Well, I'm back on your side of the tracks
 Have you come back for me to take you back?
 Back to your high society to your cocktails and your teas
 I'll look up but don't look down 'cause we got pride in Shantytown
 
 I live down in Shantytown
 Where chicken's twenty cents a pound
 And if you live on such solid ground
 Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown?
 Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown?
 
 Behind the walls of your shackled heart beats pure
 While the rich have a love to endure
 Well, is the gold in your crown turning black?
 Is there something here in Shantytown that keeps you coming back?
 
 I live down in Shantytown
 Where chicken's twenty cents a pound
 And if you live on such solid ground
 Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown?
 Whatcha doin' down in Shantytown?
 
 
 She thinks I still care
 
 Just because I asked a friend about her
 Just because I spoke her name somewhere
 Just because I rang her number by mistake today
 She thinks I still care
 
 Just because I haunt the same old places
 Where the memory of her lingers everywhere
 Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
 She thinks I still care
 
 But if she's happy thinking I still need her
 Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
 But how could she ever be so foolish
 Oh were would she get such an idea
 
 Just because I asked a friend about her
 Just because I spoke her name somewhere
 Just because I saw her then went all to pieces
 
 She thinks I still care
 She thinks I still care
 
 I saw her through the window today
 She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon cafe
 I started to keep going
 But something made me stop
 She used to love me a lot
 
 She looked lonely and I knew the cure
 Old memories would win her heart for sure
 I thought I'd walk on in
 And I give it my best shot
 She used to love me a lot
 
 I sat down beside her and she smiled
 She said where have you been it's been awhile
 She was glad to see me
 I could almost read her thoughts
 She used to love me a lot
 
 She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
 Looking at her now I can't believe I said good-bye
 It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
 She used to love me a lot
 
 I remember how good it was back then
 And I said it's not to late to start again
 We could spend a night together
 Take up where we left off
 She used to love me a lot
 
 But I panicked as she turned to walk away
 As she went out the door I heard her say
 Yes I'm in need of something
 But it's something you ain't got
 But I used to love you a lot
 
 I thought she loved me with a love that wouldn't die
 Looking at her now I can't believe she said good-bye
 She just left me standing there, I never been so shocked
 She used to love me a lot
 She used to love me a lot
 She used to love me a lot, she used to love me a lot, she used to love me a lot
 
 I saw her through the window today
 She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon cafe

 You're the shepherd of my heart so treat it tenderly
 It's a heart that needs your ever loving care
 You're the shepherd of my heart until eternity
 Lead it not into the valley of despair
 
 While it's in your keeping, guard it with your love
 Shelter it from harm along life's way
 You're the shepherd of my heart and, darling, honestly
 It's a heart that will not ever go astray
 
 You're the shepherd of my heart so surely you must know
 You have but to speak and my heart will obey
 It's at your command, my dear, because it loves you so
 So, my darling shepherd, guide it where you may
 
 If it be green pastures or a rocky road
 It will follow you and not ask why
 You're the shepherd of my heart until the trumpet blows
 And I go to meet the shepherd in the sky
 
 I discovered the valley of the shifting whispering sands
 While prospecting for gold in one of our western states
 I saw the silent windmills the crumbling water tanks
 The bones of cattle and burroughs picked clean by buzzards
 Bleached by the desert sun
 I stumbled over a crumbling buckboard nearly covered by the sands
 And stopping to rest I heard a tinkling whispering sound
 And suddenly realized that even though the wind was quiet the sand did not lie still
 I seemed to be surrounded by a mystery so heavy and oppressive
 I could scarcely breath
 For days and weeks I wandered aimlessly in this valley
 Seeking answers to the many questions that raced through my fevered mind
 Where was everyone why the white bones the dry wells
 The barren valley where people must have lived and died
 Finally I could go no farther my food and water gone
 I sat down and buried my face in my hands and resting thus
 I learnt the secret of the shifting whispering sands
 How I escaped from the valley I do not know
 But now to pay my final debt for being spared
 I must tell you what I learned out there on the desert so many years ago
 (When the day is oddly quiet and the breeze seems not to blow
 One would think the sand was resting but you'll find this is not so
 It is whispering softly whispering as it slowly moves along
 And for those who stop and listen it will sing this mournful song
 Of sidewinders and the horntoes of the Thorny Chaparral
 In the sunny days and moonlight nights the coyote's lonely yell
 How the stars seem you could touch them as you lay and gaze on high
 At the Heavens where we're hoping we'll be going when we die)
 Yes it always whispers to me of the days of long ago
 When the settlers and the miners fought the crafty Navaho
 How the cattle roamed the valley happy people worked the land
 And now everything is covered by the shifting whispering sands
 How the miner left his buckboard went to work his claim that day
 And the burroughs broke their halters when they thought he'd gone to stay
 Wandered far in search of water on to Old Sidewinder's Well
 And there their bones picked clean by buzzards that were circling when they fell
 (How they found the aged miner lying dead upon the sand
 After months they could but wonder if he died by human hand
 So they dug his grave and laid him on his back and crossed his hands
 And his secret still is hidden by the shifting whispering sands)
 This is what they whispered to me on the quiet desert air
 Of the people, and the cattle and the miner lying there
 If you want to learn their secret wander through this quiet land
 And I'm sure you'll hear the story of the shifting, whispering sands
 
 Turn on the speak it's the first time I get to talk on the speak cause you know okay
 Darn those smart alec crazy cajon boy come in to my nice clean kitchens
 And get into my pantry get my blackberry jim jam that I'd pick blackberries
 And make a jim jam in the winter time to take out on the shrimpin' boat

 And they come in to my blackberry jim jam in the pantry and get them all over

 Of soddy bodies dressed in dandy carmel candy eatin' chicken
 Fingel lickin' dancin' rancin' mancin' tancin'
 Makin' me and all by babies foldin' wads of wonderous waddy
 
 Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house where we used to live
 All I have left is a heart full of sorrow since she said she'd never forgive
 The house that we've built was once filled with laughter
 But I changed that laughter to tears
 Now I live in a world without sunshine oh I wish you were here
 Shutters and boards...
 Last night I dreamed that you came to our house to take an old book from the shelf
 If you'll open the shutters I'll tear down the boards
 'Cause I drove every nail by myself
 Shutters and boards...
  Shutters and boards...
 
 Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright 
 Round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild 
 Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace 
 Silent night holy night all is dark save the light 
 
 See the eastern wise men bring gifts and homage to our King 
 Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born 
 Silent night  all is calm all is bright 
 Poorest dreams from heaven afar heavenly host sing hallelujah 
 
  
 Silent night holy night wonderous dark lend Thy light 
 With the angels let us sing hallelujah hail the King 
 Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born

 I don't want your lonely mansion
 With a tear in every room
 All I want's the love you've promised
 Beneath the halo moon
 
 But you think I should be happy
 With your money and your name
 And hide myself in sorrows
 While you play your cheatin' game
 
 Silver threads and golden needles
 Cannot mend this heart of mine
 And I dare not drown my sorrows
 In the warm glow of your mind
 
 You can't buy my love with money
 'Cause I ain't never was that kind
 Silver threads and golden needles
 Cannot mend this heart of mine
 
 Silver threads and golden needles
 Cannot mend this heart of mine
 And I dare not drown my sorrows
 In the warm glow of your mind
 
 You can't buy my love with money
 'Cause I ain't never was that kind
 Silver threads and golden needles
 Cannot mend this heart of mine
 
 Hey little girl, with tears in your eyes
 Don't waste your time now, askin' me why
 I don't know, I know I'll just be movin' along
 You'd say that home is where my love is at
 I say that home is where I hang my hat
 The time has come to sing a travelin' song
 
 You own a house and a lot of close friends
 I love the feel of my back to the wind
 The two won't match, you know the caves so wild would be wrong
 You want your friends and love, a child and a home
 You can't buy love on a twenty year loan
 The time has come to sing a travelin' song
 
 Someday where we sat on that old porch swing
 A tamer man might offer you a ring
 A man that wants his friends and neighbors, a child and a home
 Don't waste your tears on dreams that never can be
 What's right for others is not right for me
 The time has come to sing a travelin' song
 
 The time has come to sing a travelin' song
 
 So you gave up all between us for a glamorous carear 
 And with all your talent you should be the big star of the year 
 Then you'll be public property so I release my claim to you 
 Go on and give 'em all you've got sing it pretty Sue 
 I can't take just part of you and give the world a half 
 So Smile for all the papers and give 'em autographs 
 Go on to all the cities so your public can see you 
 But I'll watch on television so sing it pretty Sue 
  
 I hope you'll soon be on the top of every hitparade 
 I'll try to be excited bout the progress that you've made 
 I'll collect your pictures like any fan would do 
 And I'll buy all your records so sing it pretty Sue 
 But I won't ever tell a soul that we have ever met 
 I'll just be one of millions who'll give the praise you get 
 And maybe every year or so I'll drop a card to you 
 To tell you I'm still listening so sing it pretty Sue
 
 The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom
 And I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
 And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell
 "Let my guitar friend do my request"
 
 Let him sing me back home with a song I
 And make my old memories come alive
 And take me away and turn back the years
 Sing me back home before I die
 
 I recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the streets
 Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
 And I heard him tell the singers, "There's a song my mama sang
 Could I hear it once before you move along?"
 
 Let him sing me back home, with the song I used to hear
 Make my old memories come alive
 Take me away and turn back the years
 Sing me back home before I die
 Sing me back home before I die
 
 I'm not a savior and I'm not a saint
 The man with the answers, I certainly ain't
 I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong
 I'm just a singer of songs
 
 But I can take you for a walk along a little country stream
 I can make you see through lovers eyes and understand their dreams
 I can help you hear a baby's laugh and feel the joy it brings
 Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing
 
 I'm not a prophet and I'm not a priest
 I'm not a wise man who's come from the East
 I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong
 I'm just a singer of songs
 
 But I can take you to a city where a Man was crucified
 I can tell you how He lived and I can tell you why He died
 I can help proclaim the glory of this Mighty King of kings
 Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing
 
 I'm not a great man, I don't claim to be
 But when I meet my Maker and He questions me
 I won't hang my head, I'll stand proud and strong
 And say, "I was a singer, Lord, I was a singer
 Yes, I was a singer of songs"
 
 One mornin' at breakfast I said to my wife
 "We've been everywhere once and some places twice"
 As I had another helpin' of country ham
 She said, "We ain't never been to Vietnam
 There's a bunch of our boys over there"
 So, we went to the Orient, Saigon
 
 Well, we got a big welcome when we drove in
 Through the gates of a place that they call Long Ben
 We checked in and everything got kinda quite
 But a soldier boy said, "Just wait 'til tonight
 Things get noisy, things start happening'
 Big bad firecrackers"
 
 Well, that night we did about four shows for the boys
 And they were livin' it up with a whole lot of noise
 We did our last song for the night
 Then we crawled into bed for some peace and quite
 But things weren't peaceful and things weren't quite
 Things were scary
 
 Well, for a few minutes June never said one word
 And I thought at first that she hadn't heard
 Then a shell exploded not two miles away
 She sat up in bed and I heard her say, "What was that?"
 I said "That was a shell or a bomb"
 She said, "I'm scared", I said, "Me too"
 
 Well, all night long that noise kept on
 And the sound would chill you right to the bone
 The bullets and the bombs and the motor shells
 Shook our bed every time one fell and it never let up
 It was gonna get worse before it got any better
 
 Well when the sun came up the noise died down
 We got a few minutes sleep and we were sleepin' sound
 Then a soldier knocked on our door and said
 "Last night we brought in seven dead and fourteen wounded"
 And would we come down to the base hospital
 And see the boys, yeah
 
 So we went to the hospital ward by day
 And every night we were singin' away
 Then the shells and the bombs 'til dawn again
 And the helicopters brought in a wounded man
 Night after night, day after day, comin' and a goin'
 
 So we sadly sang for them our last song
 And reluctantly we said so long
 We did our best to let them know that we cared
 For every last one of them it's over there
 Whether we belonged over there or not
 Somebody over here loves them and needs them
 
 Well, now that's about all there is to tell
 About that little trip into livin' hell
 And if I ever go back over there anymore
 Hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for
 I hope that war's over with and they all come back home
 To stay in peace
 
 Some people say a man is made out of mud
 A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
 Muscle and blood and skin and bones
 A mind that's weak and a back that's strong
 
 You load sixteen tons, and what do you get
 Another day older and deeper in debt
 Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
 I owe my soul to the company store
 
 I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
 I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
 I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
 And the straw boss said "Well, a-bless my soul"
 
 You load sixteen tons, and what do you get
 Another day older and deeper in debt
 Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
 I owe my soul to the company store
 
 I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
 Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
 Raised in the Canebrake by an old mama lion
 Ain't no a high-toned woman make me walk the line
 
 You load sixteen tons, and what do you get
 Another day older and deeper in debt
 Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
 I owe my soul to the company store
 
 If you see me comin', better step aside
 A lot of men didn't, and a lot of men died
 With one fist of iron, and the other of steel
 If the right one don't get you then the left one will
 
 You load sixteen tons, and what do you get
 Another day older and deeper in debt
 Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
 I owe my soul to the company store
 
 I ride an old paint he's on the worryside 
 And I'm a saddle tramp about to cross the great divide 
 Where there's grass in the coolies and water in the drawl 
 And the forty pound saddle won't make us both raw 
 Slow rider slow rider move on a little more 
 The sky boss is waitin' at the big ranch house door 
 I can't help but missin' the daughters that I had 
 One went to Denver the other went bad 
 My young wife died in a poolroom fight 
 But I try to keep singin' from morning till night 
 Slow rider slow rider... 
  
 Whenever I die take my saddle from the wall 
 Strap it on snuffy lead him out of the stall 
 Throw me on his back and turn him toward the west 
 He knows how to take me to the spot I love best 
 Slow rider slow rider...
 
 Well, the whole town listened to the radio
 For the Smiling Bill McCall Show
 Everyone in Nashville
 Was listenin' to Bill
 
 I don't want to be layin' in bed
 When they pronounce me dead
 
 He'd stand and breathe in the microphone
 With his guitar hangin' to his knee bone
 All the girls just sat and dreamed
 When Bill began his sing
 
 I don't want my hat to be hung
 When my last song is sung
 
 But he never let fame go to his head
 "This is Smiling Bill McCall", he said
 "Gonna pick and sing a song or two
 You all listen till I'm through"
 
 And if you're at the house or in your car
 Tune in this time tomorrow
 
 To all the boys he was a big hero
 They'd glue their ears to the radio
 Then talkin' a most unusual drawl
 Imitatin' Bill McCall
 
 Daddy, can I get me a guitar
 'Cause I want to be a star
 
 The girls would say of Bill McCall
 Why I bet he's over six feet tall
 Handsomest man in Nashville
 They said of Smiling Bill
 
 He won't be plantin' potato slips
 When he cashes in his chips
 
 Then one day Bill didn't make the show
 Didn't even show up for a week or so
 The station's boss said to city hall
 "Find Smiling Bill McCall"
 
 It won't be hard to track him down
 He's got the biggest feet in town
 
 Well, there's a creek that runs through Nashville
 And on the bank they found Smiling Bill
 He's committin' suicide
 But they grabbed him before he tried
 
 "Turn me loose, I want to jump", he screamed
 "'Cause I can't stand that theme"
 Let this be my final breath
 'Cause I'm scared to half to death"
 
 The big brave Smiling Bill McCall
 Is only four feet tall
 I'd rather be in the river dead
 Than to hear 'em laughin' at my bald head
 
 The years have been many the years have been long 
 But at last I'm returning to daddy and home 
 He's looking my way though he hardly can see 
 God bless my old daddy he recognize me 
 There's snow in his hair and I helped to put it there a halo of worry and care 
 As my daddy grows old he's more precious than gold 
 For I cherish the snow in his hair 
 
 His shoulders were bent with the weight of the years 
 I scarcely could hold back the flood tide of tears 
 He walked with a cane as he hurried along coming to meet me to welcome me home 
 There's snow in his hair
 
 I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin' 
 I try to make believe there's nothing wrong
 But they're always asking me about you darling
 And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone
 If they ask me I guess I'd be denyin' 
 That I've been unhappy all alone
 But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
 Where's my darling, when's she coming home
 
 I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
 To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
 But I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining through
 And then I get so doggone lonesome
 
 Time stands still when you're a waitin' 
 Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
 One lonely hour seems forever 
 Sixty minutes more to wait for you
 But I guess I'll keep waitin' 'til you're with me
 'Cause I believe that loving you is right
 But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow 
 If I can't have you with me tonight
 
 Well I know I'll keep on loving you 
 'Cause true love can't be killed
 I ought to get you off of my mind 
 But I guess I never will
 I could have a dozen others 
 But I know I'd love you still
 'Cause I get so doggone lonesome
 
 Softly and tenderly, Jesus is calling
 Calling for you and for me
 See,on the portals he's waiting and watching
 Watching for you and for me
 
 Come home,come home
 Ye who are weary,come home
 Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
 Calling,O sinner,come home
 
 Oh for the wonderful love he has promised
 Promised for you and for me
 Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon
 Pardon for you and for me
 
 Calling, oh sinner,come home
 
 
 When the postman delivered a letter
 It filled her dear heart full of joy
 But she didn't know till she read the inside
 It was the last one from her darling boy
 Dear Mom, was the way that it started
 I miss you so much it went on
 Mom, I didn't know, that I loved you so
 But I'll prove it when this war is won
 I'm writing this down in a trench, Mom
 Don't scold if it isn't so neat
 You know as you did, when I was a kid
 And I'd come home with mud on my feet
 The captain just gave us our orders
 And Mom, we will carry them through
 I'll finish this letter the first chance I get
 But now I'll just say I love you
 Then the mother's old hands began to tremble
 And she fought against tears in her eyes
 But they came unashamed for there was no name
 And she knew that her darling had died
 That night as she knelt by her bedside
 She prayed Lord above hear my plea
 And protect all the sons that are fighting tonight
 And dear God keep America free
 
 Belinda was mine 'til the time that I found her
 Holdin' Jim
 And lovin' him
 Then Sue came along, loved me strong, that's what I thought
 Me and Sue,
 But that died, too
 
 Don't know that I will but until I can find me
 A girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
 I'll be what I am
 A solitary man
 Solitary man
 
 I've had it here, being where love's a small word
 A part time thing
 A paper ring
 I know it's been done havin' one girl who loves me
 Right or wrong
 Weak or strong
 
 Don't know that I will but until I can find me
 The girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
 I'll be what I am
 A solitary man
 A solitary man
 
 Don't know that I will but until love can find me
 And the girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me
 I'll be what I am
 A solitary man
 A solitary man
 
 Solitary man
 
 I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
 A rough riding fighting Yankee man
 I love mom and apple pie
 And the freedoms that we all enjoy across this beautiful land
 
 I worked hard and I fight hard for the old Red, White, and Blue
 And I'll die a whole lot harder if it comes to where I have to
 I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
 A rough riding fighting Yankee man
 
 And when I see old Glory waving
 I think of all the brave men 
 Who have fought and died for what is right and wrong
 And when I see old Glory burnin', my blood begins to churnin'
 And I could do some fightin' of my own
 
 I don't believe in violence, I'm a God fearing man
 But I'll stand up for my country just as long as I can stand
 'Cause I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
 A rough riding fighting Yankee man
 
 I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
 A rough riding fighting Yankee man
 And I enjoy the liberty of being what I want to be 
 And achieve any goals that I can
 
 I was taught to turn the other cheek, but daddy used to say
 Walk soft and pack a big stick, but never walk away
 I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
 A rough riding fighting Yankee man
 
 And when I see old Glory waving
 I think of all the brave men 
 Who have fought and died for what is right and wrong
 And when I see old Glory burnin', my blood begins to churnin'
 And I could do some fightin' of my own
 
 'Cause I love all my brothers and we're proud of our group
 We've got the greenest country here on God's green earth
 I'm a flag waving, patriotic nephew of my Uncle Sam
 A rough riding fighting Yankee man
 
 There's a southern accent
 Where I come from
 The young 'uns call it country
 The Yankees call it dumb
 I got my own way of talkin'
 But everything is done
 With a southern accent
 Where I come from
 
 Now that drunk tank in Atlanta
 Was just a motel room to me
 I think I might go work Orlando
 If them orange groves don't freeze
 I got my own way of workin'
 But everything is run
 With a southern accent
 Where I come from
 
 For just a minute there I was dreaming
 For just a minute it was all so real
 For just a minute she was standing there, with me
 
 There's a dream that I keep having
 Where my mama comes to me
 And she kneels down over by the window
 And says a prayer for me
 I got my own way of prayin'
 And everyone's begun
 With a southern accent
 Where I come from
 
 We have our own way of livin'
 And everything is done
 With a southern accent
 Where I come from
 
 I've been a thrill seeking rambler
 And often came into this town
 But the thrills were too high for my little sky
 So I dug in and I've settled down
 
 And I got a good job in Nashville
 No way they can pay me enough
 For grindin' up tobacco leaves
 Making brut and snuff
 
 Southern comfort is killin' me
 
 I'm slowly chokin' in Tennessee
 I shovel the snuff until late afternoon
 Then I crawl with the traffic and I choke on its fumes
 And fall on the face when I get to my room
 
 Southern comfort is killin' me
 
 I met a woman in Nashville
 For a while we were carryin' on
 She'd washed snuff out of my shirts every night
 And keep me with clean ones on
 
 But I guess she got tired of tobacco
 At least of the regular kind
 Now I'm still workin' where nicotine
 And memories are burnin' in my mind
 
 And Southern comfort is killin' me
 
 The Cumberland cannot enhermit each bee
 I'm sniffin' and dippin' and livin' alone
 I smell funny smoke and I know where she's gone
 She's in some other county now proving her own
 
 Southern comfort is killin' me
 Southern comfort is killin' me
 
 Added to their thirteen colonies
 Tennessee, Vermont, Kentucky
 Louisiana and Ohio, Mississippi, Indiana
 Alabama, Maine, Missouri
 
 Added Arkansas and Michigan added Florida and Texas
 And in Texas five thousand men under Santa Anna
 Had crossed the Rio Grande headed for San Antonio
 David Crockett left Tennessee with the volunteers headed for San Antonio
 
 At a Spanish mission near San Antonio they met a knife-fighter
 And a gambler named Jim Bowie and a Britisher named Travis
 A hundred and eighty Americans against five thousand to the death
 
 Southwind, you picked her up in Jacksonville
 And left me cold and lonesome in the rain
 Southwind, you took her off to Nashville
 Left me chokin' in the smoke behind the train
 And you go whoo-woo-hoo
 She's gone a gain on the Southwind
 
 Southwind, I need a forty-dollar ticket
 And about this time tomorrow I'll be gone
 Southwind, but if I had forty dollars
 I would by myself a smile to carry on
 And you go whoo-woo-hoo
 She's gone a gain on the Southwind
 
 Southwind, take her fast and take her far
 'Cause that's the way she always likes to go
 Southwind, I will be waitin' for the round trip
 If you'll bring her back and I done told her so
 Don't you go whoo-woo-hoo
 She's gone again on the Southwind
 
 Jesus
 I don't wanna die alone
 Jesus, oh Jesus
 I don't wanna die alone
 
 My love wasn't true
 Now all I have is you
 
 Jesus oh Jesus
 I don't wanna die alone
 
 Jesus
 If you hear my last breath
 Don't leave me here
 Left to die a lonely death
 I know I have sinned but Lord I'm
 Suffering
 
 Jesus, oh Jesus
 If you hear my last breath
 
 Jesus
 I don't wanna die alone
 Jesus, oh Jesus
 I don't wanna die alone
 
 My love wasn't true
 Now all I have is you
 
 Jesus, oh Jesus
 I don't wanna die alone
 
 Jesus
 Jesus
 All my troubles
 All my pain
 Will leave me
 Once again
 
 All my troubles
 All my pain
 It's gonna leave me once again
 
 All my troubles
 All my pain
 It's gonna leave me once again 
 Gonna leave me
 Once again
 
 There's just one word I don't want to hear
 When I heard it called it cost a friend quite dear
 I can hear it echo as though it were now
 When I was a chasin' of the long horned cow
 
 Stampede they're comin' up to draw
 Stampede three thousand herd or more
 Here they come a smokin' fire boys you better earn your hire
 Stampede and hell to score
 
 Now Frank he was my partner he rode point upon my heart
 We drank and fought and partnered back to back at troubles start
 We heard the call on evening in the thunder and the black
 When the lightnin' hit the leaders and the devil led the pack
 
 Stampede they're comin' up to draw...
 
 Our horses they were handy for we had just rode in
 We went from drinkin' coffee to thinkin' of our sins
 There wasn't time for prayin' there was hardly time to cuss
 It was a smokin' roarin' rattle and the leaders were on us
 
 Stampede they're comin' up to draw
 
 Old Frank's foot it missed the stirrup and his hand it missed the horn
 And as the cattle crossed him from his body life was torn
 I was mounted and a ridin' when I heard his final yell
 Said hey Johnny head the wild bunch and do the ladies well
 
 Stampede they're comin' up to draw
 
 No I ain't got no partner cause old Frank's done dead and gone
 But just so he'd be remembered Peter put him in this song
 Some admire headstones but I think he'd like this best
 He weren't fancy in his livin' so he ain't fancy in his rest
 
 Stampede they're comin' up to draw
 
 Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
 Giving all your love to just one man
 You'll have bad times
 And he'll have good times,
 Doin' things that you don't understand
 
 But if you love him you'll forgive him,
 Even though he's hard to understand
 And if you love him oh be proud of him,
 'cause after all he's just a man
 
 Stand by your man,
 Give him two arms to cling to,
 And something warm to come to
 When nights are cold and lonely
 
 Stand by your man,
 And show the world you love him
 Keep giving all the love you can
 Stand by your man
 
 Stand by your man,
 And show the world you love him
 Keep giving all the love you can
 Stand by your man
 
 They put this microphone down here near my guitar
 Heh, let it all hang out
 I thought my guitar was out of tune at first
 You sorry son of a..
 It is out of tune
 Is that right?
 Terry, is that right?
 Will you tune this son bitch for me?
 Got all kinds of songs, here's one called "A boy named sue"
 You want to hear that one?
 You want to hear "a boy named sue"?
 I do too. I'm anxious to hear it
 I don't know how in the hell it's gonna sound. I'm anxious to hear it
 Does that camera block your view right there, is that alright?
 You want me to leave it there?
 Just gonna put it there then
 Where in the hell is my guitar? Oh, here it is
 
 We're sorry to say, the Luther passed away seven months ago
 After being with us for 13 years. Luther Perkins
 And uh, the fella that is playing the guitar with us now is doing a wonderful job
 'Course nobody can really replace Luther.
 How about one big cheer for Luther Perkins
 
 Yeah, I had a song called San Quentin, I was going to do
 Where's my....hey, in my kit back in there where I've got all my dope
 I mean, where I got all my things
 
 There's a, there's a, there's a little red notebook back there
 Would somebody, would one of the guards bring it to me
 Somebody bring it to me, bring me the red notebook, and I will uh..
 
 Hey, that, that briefcase back there of mine, you know,
 That's got all the songs I stole in it
 
 Telling it like it is, ain't I? Alright
 
 Wrote a song yesterday. I try.
 It takes a lot of imagination to write a sometimes to write a song
 And to really, to really put something into it
 Where somebody else can understand it and feel it .
 Well we've been in several prisons
 San Quentin, and Folsom prison, and the Starkville Mississippi jail
 An El Paso jail. And uh.
 You wouldn't believe it, one night I got in jail in Starkville Mississippi
 For picking flowers.
 I was walking down the street. I may sing heaven for you a little bit later
 I was walking down the street....what?
 Excuse me I couldn't hear you I was talking
 I was walking down the street, and uh
 You know, going to get me some cigarettes or something
 'Bout two in the morning, after a show. I think it was
 Anyway, I reached down and picked a dandelion here and a daisy there as I went along
 And this car pulls up.
 Said, get it the hell in here boy, what are you doing?
 Said, I'm just picking flowers
 Well,thirty six dollars for picking flowers and a night in jail 
 You can't hardly win can ya, goddamn
 No telling what they'd do if you pull an apple or something
 Well I'd like to do this song on behalf of all you guys in San Quentin
 To kinda get back at whoever you want to out there
 In my case, I'd like to get back at the fella down in Starkville Mississippi
 That still has my thirty six dollars
 
 Well, I left my motel room, down at the Starkville Motel,
 The town had gone to sleep and I was feelin' fairly well.
 I strolled along the sidewalk 'neath the sweet magnolia trees;
 
 I was whistlin', pickin' flowers, swayin' in the southern breeze.
 I found myself surrounded; one policeman said: "That's him.
 Come along, wild flower child. Don't you know that it's two a.m."
 
 They're bound to get you.
 'Cause they got a curfew.
 And you go to the Starkville City jail.
 
 Well, they threw me in the car and started driving into town;
 I said: "What the hell did I do?"
 And he said: "Shut up and sit down."
 
 Well, they emptied out my pockets, took my pills and guitar picks.
 I said: "Wait, my name is..." "Ah, shut up."
 Well, I sure was in a fix.
 
 The sergeant put me in a cell, then he went home for the night;
 I said: "Come back here, you so and so;
 I ain't bein' treated right."
 
 Well, they're bound to get you.
 'Cause they got a curfew.
 And you go to the Starkville City jail.
 
 I started pacin' back and forth, and now and then I'd yell,
 And kick my forty dollar shoes against the steel floor of my cell.
 I'd walk awhile and kick awhile, and all night nobody came.
 
 Then I sadly remembered that they didn't even take my name.
 At 8 a.m. they let me out, I said: "Gimme them things of mine!"
 They gave me a sneer and a guitar pick, and a yellow dandelion.
 
 They're bound to get you.
 'Cause they got a curfew.
 And you go to the Starkville City jail.
 And you go to the Starkville City jail.
 
 To love you so and still not have you will destroy me in time 
 So I'm goin' away where nobody knows me and get you off of my mind 
 I've packed my things a dozen times but unpack is all I do 
 Yes I'm still in town still around and still in love with you 
 I made it to the edge of town and turned around 
 I made it to the bridge downtown but my nerve let me down 
 I tried to go but how can I leave when all roads lead to you 
 Yes I'm still in town still around and still in love with you 
  
 I made it to the edge of town...
 
 Well, the readin' and the writin' arithmetic
 Never did get through to me
 It ain't because I'm square or thick
 'Cause I learned my A, be, see
 
 But when I graduated from the grammar school
 And I moved one grade above
 I began to be a snook at books
 But I made straight A's in love
 
 Now the teacher would say to learn your algebra
 But I'd bring home see's and D's
 How could I make an A when there's a swingin' maid
 On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me?
 
 Oh, my grades are low on my card, I know
 But they oughta give me one above
 If they'd give me a mark for learnin' in the dark
 I'd have straight A's in love
 
 Now in my senior year with graduation near
 I did my homework every night
 And when my momma said I oughta go to bed
 I turn out all the lights
 
 But my sweetie pie was waitin' right outside
 She'd be a coolin' like a dove
 Though I did my best, I failed semester test
 But I made straight A's in love
 
 Now the teacher would say to learn your algebra
 But I'd bring home see's and D's
 How could I make an A when there's a swingin' maid
 On the left and on the right and in the back and the front of me
 
 Oh, my grades are low on my card, I know
 But they oughta give me one above
 If they'd give me a mark for learnin' in the dark
 I'd have straight A's in love
 
 In New York city just walking the street
 Ran out of money had nothing to eat
 I stopped at the Plaza, that fancy hotel
 Where you can check in if you're well to do well'?'
 The first of July and a hundred and four
 I stopped at the Plaza's front revolving door
 I stepped in the door and went around for a ride
 Treatin' myself to the cool air inside
 Then I found myself in a chandeliered room
 Where people were dining and I hid in the gloom
 My hunger pains hurt 'til I thought I would break
 When a waiter brought out a big strawberry cake
 
 Oh that strawberry cake
 Oh that strawberry cake
 Out in California them berries were grown
 And into this city them berries were flown
 For making that strawberry cake
 
 Then I thought of Oxnard, just north of LA
 Where I picked strawberries for many a day
 Hard work with no future for the harvest was done
 And I headed eastward a-travelin' by thumb
 And nobody wanted me here in this town
 I felt like a stray dog they all kick around
 Them berries reminded me of my bad breaks
 I'm hungry and I want that strawberry cake
 
 I deserve that strawberry cake
 Deserve that strawberry cake
 I ran and I grabbed it then out the side door
 Into Central Park through the bushes I tore
 Holdin' my strawberry cake
 
 I look back behind me and what do I see
 The chef and headwaiter and the ma'tre d
 I had a nice helpin' of cake as I ran
 I gobble them berries as fast as I can
 They're closin' the gap as I slowed down to eat
 But the cake brought a new surge of power to my feet
 I hid in the bush when the lead I did take
 And I quietly finished my strawberry cake
 
 I ate all that strawberry cake
 That fine fancy strawberry cake
 Someone at the plaza is without dessert
 But for the first time in days now my belly don't hurt
 I'm full of strawberry cake
 
 As I walked out on the streets of Laredo.
 As I walked out on Laredo one day,
 I spied a poor cowboy wrapped in white linen,
 Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.
 
 "I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy."
 These words he did say as I boldly walked by.
 "Come an' sit down beside me an' hear my sad story.
 "I'm shot in the breast an' I know I must die."
 
 "It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing.
 "Once in the saddle, I used to go gay.
 "First to the card-house and then down to Rose's.
 "But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today."
 
 "Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin.
 "Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall.
 "Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin.
 "Roses to deaden the clods as they fall."
 
 "Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly.
 "Play the dead march as you carry me along.
 "Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me,
 "I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong."
 
 "Then go write a letter to my gray-haired mother,
 "An' tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone.
 "But please not one word of the man who had killed me.
 "Don't mention his name and his name will pass on."
 
 When thus he had spoken, the hot sun was setting.
 The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay.
 We took the young cowboy down to the green valley,
 And there stands his marker, we made, to this day.
 
 We beat the drum slowly and played the Fife lowly,
 Played the dead march as we carried him along.
 Down in the green valley, laid the sod o'er him.
 He was a young cowboy and he said he'd done wrong.
 
 Well now sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertime
 Be my little sugar and love me all the time
 Honey in the morning honey in the evening honey at suppertime
 Be my little honey and love me all the time
 
 Put your arms around me swear by stars above
 You'll be mine forever in the heaven of love
 Sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertime
 Be my little sugar and love me all the time
 
 Now sugar time is anytime that you're near oh you're so dear
 Now don't you roam just be my honeycomb and live in a heaven of love
 
 Well sugar in the morning
 
 Summertime is past and gone
 I'm on my way back home
 
 Summertime is past and and gone
 And I'm on my way back home
 To see the only one I ever loved
 
 * Now the moon is shining bright
 It lights my pathway tonight
 Back to the only one I ever loved
 
 ** Oh I know she waits for me
 Back in old Tenneessee
 She was sent to me from God above
 
 * Repeat
 
 ** Repeat
 
 * Repeat
 
 Well, I woke up Sunday morning
 With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
 And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
 So I had one more for dessert
 Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
 And found my cleanest dirty shirt
 Then I washed my face and combed my hair
 And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
 
 I'd smoked my mind the night before
 With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
 But I lit my first and watched a small kid
 Playing with a can that he was kicking
 Then I walked across the street
 And caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken
 And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
 Somewhere, somehow along the way
 
 On a Sunday morning sidewalk
 I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
 'Cause there's something in a Sunday
 That makes a body feel alone
 And there's nothing short a' dying
 That's half as lonesome as the sound
 Of the sleeping city sidewalk
 And Sunday morning coming down
 
 In the park I saw a daddy
 With a laughing little girl that he was swinging
 And I stopped beside a Sunday school
 And listened to the songs they were singing
 Then I headed down the street
 And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
 And it echoed through the canyons
 Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
 
 On a Sunday morning sidewalk
 I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
 'Cause there's something in a Sunday
 That makes a body feel alone
 And there's nothing short a' dying
 That's half as lonesome as the sound
 Of the sleeping city sidewalk
 And Sunday morning coming down
 
 Many years ago in days of childhood I used to play till evening SHADOWS CAME
 THEN winding down AN old familiar pathway I hear my mother call at setting sun
 Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
 Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last
 THROUGH THE DISTANT CLOUDS I SEE MY MOTHER
 HER FACE IS SHINING BRIGHT, WITH TENDER LOVE
 SHE'S GONE UP IN HEAVEN, WITH HER MAKER
 AND I CAN STILL HEAR HER VOICE, FROM UP ABOVE
 
 Come home come home it's suppertime the shadows lengthen fast
 Come home come home it's suppertime we're going home at last
 
 There is a young cowboy he lives on the range
 His horse and his cattle are his only companions
 He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons
 Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
 
 And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
 Thinking about women and glasses of beer
 And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
 He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
 As if maybe someone could hear
 
 Goodnight you moonlight ladies
 Rockabye sweet baby James
 Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
 Won't you let me go down in my dreams
 And rockabye sweet baby James
 
 Now the first of December was covered with snow
 And so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
 Lord, the Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
 With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go
 
 There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
 A song that they sing when they take to the sea
 A song that they sing of their home in the sky
 Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
 But singing works just fine for me
 
 Well, now sweetheart you done me wrong
 You have left me all alone
 Maybe there will come a time
 Sweetheart, when you will change your mind
 
 The road is rough
 And rocky too, and 
 
 Well, now I looked over Jordan and what did I see
 Comin' for to carry me home
 There was a band of angels a comin' after me
 Comin' for to carry me home
 
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 
 Well, I'm sometimes up and I'm sometimes down
 Comin' for to carry me home
 But I know my soul is heavenly bound
 Comin' for to carry me home
 
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 
 Well, now if you get there before I do
 Comin' for to carry me home
 Tell all of my friends that I'm a comin' too
 Comin' for to carry me home
 
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 Well, now they're comin' for to carry me home
 
 We're gonna ride the Bible train now
 No some won't ride, but we're going get on the Bible train
 Some ride but not all the way
 The Bible train is in the yard now and it's waiting and oh it looks so good
 But you might get bored and impatient waiting like those two good brothers over there
 They pass around the bottle in the car before they got on the train
 Just want to take one more for the road and then, that leads to something else
 Well they ain't on the train no more and maybe 9 or 10 got off with them
 There's a sister in the church and she says to her friend 
 Your husband works at night and so does mine, why don't we just
 
 Get together sometime when they're gone and go downtown and find us some action, 
 Well then they gotta get off the Bible train.
 
 And then another man he's sitting over there looking at a woman in the corner 
 And he's gives her that eye, you know and they
 
 Meet later, secretly, so they got to get off, 
 This train's got a rule against adultery.
 
 And while all this is happening the train is getting ready to go, 
 But there's a lot more to get off than different reasons
 
 Just before the train pulls out, 
 But listen its starting to move now, 
 Listen to it.
 
 Here we go'.
 
 As it leaves the man on the caboose with a long white beard says,
 This train is bound for gory, this train,
 This train is bound for glory, this train,
 This train is bound for glory nobody rides it but the righteous and holy,
 This train is bound for glory, this train
 
 This train is a free train, this train,
 This train is a free train, this train,
 This train is a free train,
 Everybody rides in Jesus' name
 This train is a free train, this train,
 
 This train it don't pull no liars, this train
 This train don't pull no liars, this train
 This train don't pull no liars,
 No false pretenders and no backbiters
 This train don't pull no liars, this train.
 
 This train is a clean train, this train
 This train is a clean train, this train
 This train is a clean train,
 Everybody rides it in Jesus' name
 This train is a clean train, this train
 
 Do you want to ride it children, this holy train'
 Do you want to ride it children, this righteous train'
 
 Get on board
 Get on board
 Get on board
 Get on board this holy train
 Get on board
 Get on board
 Get on board this holy train
 
 Well, I've been from Boston to L.A.
 Seen Boulder Dam and Frisco Bay
 I seen New York City and Washington
 
 Seen Montreal and Saskatchewan and Rhode Island
 And I've worked in three all night
 Service stations and I drove a truck
 
 Take me home, my heart is heavy and my feet are sore
 Take me home, I don't wanna roam no more
 
 Well, I slept all night in a water trough
 Had the flu and the croup and the whoopin' cough
 Had the mumps and the measles and the seven years itch
 
 And I can't count the times
 That I've had a cold and a sore throat
 Not to mention all the times
 That I cut my fingers on a sardine can
 
 Take me home, my heart is heavy
 
 Well, I can just see 'em all now just a gatherin' 'round
 Mama's supper table when the sun goes down
 And my good old pappy when the blessing is said
 
 Fillin' up his plate with black eyed peas
 And all that stuff and side meat
 And a great big hunk of my dear sweet mama's
 Hot buttered cornbread
 
 Take me home, my heart is heavy
 Take me home, my heart is heavy
 
 On your knees you are taller than trees you can look over heartaches and pain 
 When my faith is gone to my knees I will go growing stronger and taller than trees 
 One night it was a long time ago now I knelt at my mother's knee 
 And she said son lift up your eyes to him in the skies 
 And you'll grow like the mighty oaks 
 But you son created in image of God can become taller than the tallest trees 
 And this was the answer I felt as down at her knees I knelt 
 On your knees you're taller than trees 
 You can look over all your heartaches and son you can look over all of your pains 
 When my faith is gone to my knees I will go growing stronger and taller than trees
 
 I'm gonna write a tear stained letter,
 I'm gonna mail it straight to you.
 I'm gonna bring back to your mind,
 What you said about always being true.
 Bout our secret hiding places;
 Being daily satisfied.
 I can see you sitting and reading it,
 While you hang you head and cry.
 I just hope you're not so sad,
 You're gonna go down suicide.
 
 I'm gonna write a tear stained letter:
 Put it special delivery.
 'Cause it's gonna be full of stuff,
 That's only known to you and me.
 'Bout how every time I get turned on,
 You turn me off and bring me down.
 It'll be about the darkest news,
 That ever did arrive in your hometown.
 It'll be about the saddest thing,
 Your mailman ever did bring around.
 
 I'm gonna write a tear stained letter,
 I'm gonna tell you one more time.
 That you still could reconsider,
 And come back to being mine.
 An' if you think about what I'm saying,
 It'd be hard to refuse.
 Just be sure you think a long time,
 On the answer that you choose.
 It will be a most important piece,
 Of personal, private news.
 
 I'm gonna write a tear stained letter,
 Mark it "Personal Private News."
 An' I hope you'll keep it to yourself,
 An' don't go 'round crying the blues.
 Giving off a bad impression,
 As to what went really wrong.
 When what it was was that suddenly,
 The music was all gone.
 And this man and this woman got cut off,
 In the middle of our song.
 
 I'm gonna write a tear stained letter,
 I'm gonna put it to a tune.
 So I'll be sending with it,
 A sweet melody for you.
 And not some red-hot, upbeat zinger,
 That'll set your body on fire.
 But a hunk of love included,
 Meant to take you a little higher.
 And to settle on your sweet, sweet mind,
 At night when you retire.
 
 I'm gonna write a tear stained letter.
 
 You take this hammer take it to the capt hey take this hammer take it to the capt 
 Take this hammer take it to the capt you can tell him I'm gone tell him I'm gone 
 'Cause I ain't gonna take no more kicks and whippings

 You can tell him I'm gone gone gone you can tell him I'm gone 
 Captain call me a hard headed devil well the captain call me a hard headed devil

 Tell him I'm gone tell him I'm gone just tell him I'm gone 
 Take this hammer take it to the capt hey take this hammer take it to the capt
 
 You keep saying you love him
 I believe that it's true
 And it just doesn't matter
 How much I love you
 
 But in time you'll understand, dear
 When you shed a tear
 Then you'll know you were living
 In your tender years
 
 In your eyes there's a love light
 That shines for him
 But how long will it stay there
 Will that love light grow dim
 
 You can just see the happiness
 You can't see the tears
 It's true, 'cause you're living
 In your tender years
 
 So if I can't be your first love
 I'll wait and be your last
 I'll be somewhere in your future
 To help you forget the past
 
 And you'll know that I love you
 With a love that's sincere
 For I'll wait 'til you're through living
 In your tender years
 
 Yes, you'll know that I love you
 With a love that's sincere
 Yes, I'll wait 'til you're through living
 In your tender years
 
 Mama I guess you heard
 I got married in Tennessee
 I got a blue-eyed girl
 Who thinks the world of me
 We got a cabin in the country
 And a creek that rolls nearby
 And a dog that won't even bark at a firefly
 Our clothes just hang outside our backdoor
 And there's a tire that swings in the air
 Ten feet or more
 There's a church I can't seem to find
 On Sunday mornin'
 But I sure found the place that I belong in
 
 And we wear blue jeans
 And big green beans
 Spend the summertime naturally high
 By chopping wood, the next one or five
 Saving our money for the county fair
 George Jones' supposed to be there
 We got forty acres of corn in the ground
 Tennessee taters we sell by the pound
 Proud as we can be
 To live in Tennessee
 
 Mama you and dad have got to come stay with us sometime
 I know you love that sweet little gal of mine
 You and her could talk about babies
 Make some home made apple pie
 While me and dad could take a walk
 Maybe talk about old times
 
 And we wear blue jeans
 And big green beans
 Spend the summertime naturally high
 By chopping wood, the next one or five
 Saving our money for the county fair
 George Jones' supposed to be there
 We got forty acres of corn in the ground
 Tennessee taters we sell by the pound
 Proud as we can be
 That we live in Tennessee
 
 We are proud as we can be
 To be from Tennessee
 We are proud as we can be
 To be from Tennessee
 
 In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town,
 Sat a boy and his guitar, and the people came from miles around.
 And all the girls from there to Austin,
 Were slipping away from home and putting jewelery in hock.
 To take the trip, to go and listen,
 To the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.
 
 And he would play,
 
 Well, he couldn't ride or wrangle, and he never cared to make a dime.
 But give him his guitar, and he'd be happy all the time.
 And all the girls from nine to ninety,
 Were snapping fingers, tapping toes, and begging him: "Don't stop."
 And hypnotized and fascinated,
 By the little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.
 
 And he would play,
 
 Then one day he was gone, and no one ever saw him 'round,
 He'd vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town.
 But all the girls still dreamed about him.
 And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked.
 And then one day on the Hit Parade,
 Was a little dark-haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top box.
 
 And he would play
 
 Back about eighteen and twenty-five
 I left Tennessee very much alive
 I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud
 If I hadn't been riding on the Tennessee Stud
 
 Had some trouble with my sweetheart's Pa
 One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
 I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fudd
 And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud
 
 The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
 The color of the sun and his eyes were green
 He had the nerve and he had the blood
 There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud
 
 Drifted on down into no man's land
 Across the river called the Rio Grande
 Raced my horse with the Spaniard's foe
 Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold
 
 Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
 We got in a fight over Tennessee
 Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
 And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud
 
 The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
 The color of the sun and his eyes were green
 He had the nerve and he had the blood
 There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud
 
 I rode right back across Arkansas
 I whupped her brother and I whupped her Pa
 I found that girl with the golden hair
 She was riding on a Tennessee Mare
 
 Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
 Little horse colt playing round the door
 I loved the girl with the golden hair
 And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare
 
 The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
 The color of the sun and his eyes were green
 He had the nerve and he had the blood
 There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud
 
 Listen to my song
 And if you want to sing along
 It's about where I belong
 Texas
 
 Sometimes far into the night
 And until the morning light
 I pray with all my might
 To be in Texas
 
 It's where I want to be
 The only place for me
 Where my spirit can be free
 Texas
 
 It's where I want to be
 The only place for me
 Where my spirit can be free
 Texas
 
 Listen to my song
 And if you want to sing along
 Its about where I belong
 Texas
 
 Bein' six years old I had seen some trains before
 So it's hard to figure out what I'm at the depot for
 Things're big and black and smokin' steam screamin' at the wheels
 Bigger'n anything there is last that's the way she feels
 
 Trains're big and black and smokin' louder'n July 4th
 But everybody's actin' like this might be something more
 Than just pickin' up the mail or the soldiers from the war
 Somethin' even old man Wileman's never seen before
 
 And it's late afternoon on a hot Texas day
 Somethin' strange was goin' on and we's all in the way
 There are 50 or 60 people just sittin' on their cars
 And the ole men left their domioes and come down from the bars
 
 And everybody's checkin' old Jack Kittrell checks his watch
 And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear 'em pop
 So we already knowed it when they finally said train time
 You'd've thought that Judgement Day was rollin' down the line
 
 'Cause things got real quiet and mama jerked me back
 But not vbefore I get the chance to lay a nickel on the track
 
 Look out here she comes she's comin' look out there she goes she's gone
 Screamin' straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone
 Big and red and silver she don't lay no smoke
 She's a fast rollin' streamline come to show the folks
 
 I said look out here she comes she's comin' look out there she goes she's gone
 Screamin' straight through Texas like a mad dog cyclone
 
 Lord she never even stopped
 She left 50 or 60 people still sittin' on their cars
 Wonderin' what it's comin' to and how it got this far
 And me I got a nickel smashed flatter than a dime
 By a mad dog runaway red silver streamline train
 
 Look out here she comes
 Look out here she comes
 
 You're tellin' everyone in town that I don't treat you right
 You even say I stay away and don't come home at night
 I'm losing you and you are all I've got thanks a lot thanks a lot
 
 It seems you like to hurt me and you know I'm good to you
 I'd give you anything I own do anything you want me to
 Yeah now you really got me on the spot thanks a lot thanks a lot
 
 Still I would forgive you if you'd let me I'd be glad if we could try again
 But it seems that you're just out to get me
 And it looks as if you're just about to win
 No matter what you do I'll always do love you
 
 And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
 And you're callin' me those things you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot
 
 No matter what you do I always do love you
 And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
 You say I'm happy but you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot thanks a lot
 
 Up in the mornin', out on a job
 Work like the devil for my pay
 While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
 But roll around heaven all day
 
 Fussed with my woman
 Toil for my kids
 Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
 While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
 But roll around heaven all day
 
 Good Lord up above, can't you hear me cryin'
 Tears all in my eyes
 Send down that cloud with your silvery linin'
 Lift me to paradise
 
 Oh, show me that river, take me across
 Wash all my troubles away
 Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
 But roll around heaven all day
 
 Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
 But roll around heaven all day
 
 In a vine covered shack in the mountains. 
 Bravely fighting the battle of time. 
 There's a dear one who's wept through life's sorrows. 
 It's that silver haired daddy of mine.
 
 If I could recall all the heartaches, dear ole daddy I've caused you to bear. 
 If I could erase those lines from your face and bring back the gold to your hair. 
 If God would but grant me the power just to turn back the pages of time. 
 I would give all I own just to put a tone to that silver haired daddy of mine.
 
 Mhm mhm when you left I shed a million teardrops over you 
 But that's all over my crying days are through 
 When you left my heart was cold and every day was blue 
 But that's all over I've found somebody new 
 Someone that can make me happy make me want to smile 
 Someone I'm gonna have around me for a long long while 
 Someday we may meet again but I won't fall for you 
 That's all over I've found somebody new mhm mhm 
 
 Someone that can make me happy... 
 Yes that's all over I've found somebody new mhm mhm
 
 Well now I heard that you been thinking bout me really I don't mind 
 I know you try to block my progress a lot of the time 
 Well the mean things you said don't make me feel bad 
 Cause I can't miss a friend that I never had 
  I've got Jesus and that's enough  that's enough 
 When I'm sick  and troubled  
 When I call him he will answer my prayers  
 When I'm burdened  with a load  
 That's when Jesus is a comforter  
 Well you may scorn me turn your back on me 
 God's got his arms wrapped all around me 
  I've got Jesus and that's enough  that's enough 
 You know there's been a lotta times that I didn't have a dime 
 And I didn't cry to nobody but my Lord 
 He heard my plea and came to see about me cause he's one thing I can afford 
 So if you push me down he'll pick me up 
 And he'll stick by me when the goin' gets tough 
  I've got Jesus and that's enough  that's enough 
 Well he's the great emancipator and my heart regulator  yes he is 
 He'll make my way brighter and my burdens lighter yes he will  
 Well you may scorn me turn your back on me 
 God's got his arms wrapped all around me 
 And he fights down the devil till he makes him give up 
 And that's enough  that's enough 
 When I'm sick ....
 
 To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
 And reminisce with you that's my desire.
 To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
 And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
 We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
 I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
 To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
 Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.
 
 There was a showdown at high noon reputations on the line
 It was the good guys and the bad guys I was eight and he was nine
 And I forgot to keep my back to the wall in Dodge that day
 And from somewhere behind me I heard him say
 
 "That's one you owe me I let you slide
 I can't back shoot a buddy it goes against my pride
 So like two desperado's we'll ride off in the sun
 But just remember you owe me one"
 
 It was high school and football on two different teams
 I was good but he was better than I would ever be
 And when I finally crossed the goal line ahead of him that day
 As the crowd was goin' wild I heard him say
 
 "That's one you owe me I let you slide
 I can't back shoot a buddy it goes against my pride
 So like two desperado's we'll ride off in the sun
 But just remember you owe me one"
 
 She was long and lean and pretty and soon to be his bride
 When she strayed into my arms one day with lovin' on her mind
 Well I was almost tempted by her soft touch and her sigh
 But the next time I saw him I could look him in the eye
 
 That's one you owe me I let you slide
 I can't back shoot a buddy it goes against my pride
 So like two desperado's we'll ride off in the sun
 But just remember you owe me one
 
 That's one you owe me I let you slide
 I can't back shoot a buddy it goes against my pride
 So like two desperado's we'll ride off in the sun
 But just remember you owe me one
 
 Saw a girl in Tampa I asked her for a date 
 She said baby I'm a sailor this thing better waits 
 I said I don't believe you would you show me some proof 
 She showed me her tattoo then I knew that that's the truth 
 Met a woman on a highway by the exit sign 
 You'd bet your last dollar that she was forty-nine 
 But she swore to me that she was still in her youth 
 When I turned down the lights I knew that that's the truth 
 Had a girl on a border I guess she was shy never spoke a word in years not even hi 
 But one night she said honey we're gonna raise the roof 
 She put on some dancin' shoes then I knew that that's the truth 
 I knew a preacher's daughter in fact I knew her well 
 He said son you better ramble unless you've got somethin' to sell 
 It's an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth 
 He pulled out a forty-four now I know that that's the truth that's the truth
 
 
 Oh, the Apache Squaw,
 How many long, lean years you saw,
 How many bitter Winter nights,
 Shivering in a cold teepee, 
 Shivering in a cold teepee.
 
 Oh, the Apache Squaw,
 How many hungry kids you saw,
 How many bloody warriors,
 Run in to the sea, fleeing to the sea.
 
 Well, they tell me that you saw Cochise,
 When he made his last stand,
 He said, 
 The next white man that sees my face,
 Is gonna be a dead white man.
 
 Oh, the Apache Squaw,
 How many broken hearts you saw,
 You've had misty eyes for year,
 Could that mist be tears, 
 Could that mist be tears.
 
 Here lies less more
 Four slugs from a forty-four
 No less no more
 
 Out in Arizona just south of Tucson
 Where tumbleweeds tumble in search of a home
 There's a town they call Tombstone where the brave never cry
 They live by a sixgun by a sixgun they die
 
 It's been a long time now since the town was a boom
 The jailhouse is empty so's the Palace Saloon
 Just one look will tell you that this town was real
 A secluded old dirt road leads up to Boot Hill
 
 Walk up to the fence there and look at the view
 That's where they were hanging eighteen eighty two
 It's easy to see where the brave men have died
 Rope marks on the oak tree are now petrified
 
 At night when the moon shines so far away
 It gets mighty lonesome lookin' down on their graves
 There lies Billy Clanton never wanted to kill
 But he's there with the guilty way up on Boot Hill 
 
 Ira Hayes
 Ira Hayes
 Call him drunken Ira Hayes
 He won't answer anymore
 Not the whiskey drinking Indian
 Or the marine that went to war
 
 Gather 'round me people
 There's a story I would tell
 'Bout a brave young Indian
 You should remember well
 From the land of the Pima Indian
 A proud and noble band
 Who farmed the Phoenix Valley
 In Arizona land
 Down the ditches a thousand years
 The waters grew Ira's peoples' crops
 'Til the white man stole their water rights
 And the sparkling water stopped
 Now, Ira's folks were hungry
 And their land grew crops of weeds
 When war came, Ira volunteered
 And forgot the white man's greed
 
 Call him drunken Ira Hayes
 He won't answer anymore
 Not the whiskey drinking Indian
 Or the marine that went to war
 
 There they battled up Iwo Jima hill
 Two hundred and fifty men
 But only twenty-seven lived
 To walk back down again
 And when the fight was over
 And Old Glory raised
 Among the men who held it high
 Was the Indian, Ira Hayes
 
 Call him drunken Ira Hayes
 He won't answer anymore
 Not the whiskey drinking Indian
 Or the marine that went to war
 
 Ira Hayes returned a hero
 Celebrated through the land
 He was wined and speeched and honored
 Everybody shook his hand
 But he was just a Pima Indian
 No water, no home, no chance
 At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
 And when did the Indians dance
 
 Call him drunken Ira Hayes
 He won't answer anymore
 Not the whiskey drinking Indian
 Or the marine that went to war
 
 Then Ira started drinking hard
 Jail was often his home
 They let him raise the flag and lower it
 Like you'd throw a dog a bone
 He died drunk early one morning
 Alone in the land he fought to save
 Two inches of water and a lonely ditch
 Was a grave for Ira Hayes
 
 Call him drunken Ira Hayes
 He won't answer anymore
 Not the whiskey drinking Indian
 Or the marine that went to war
 
 Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
 But his land is just as dry
 And his ghost is lying thirsty
 In the ditch where Ira died
 
 I asked my love to take a walk
 Take a walk just a little ways
 And as we walked, along we talk
 All would be our wedding day
 
 And only say that you'll be mine
 In no others arms entwined
 Down beside where the waters flow
 Down by the banks of the Ohio
 
 I asked her if she'd marry me
 And my wife forever be
 She only turned her head away
 And had no other words to say
 
 And only say that you'll be mine
 In no others arms entwined
 Down beside where the waters flow
 Down by the banks of the Ohio
 
 I plunged a knife into her breast
 And told her she was going to rest
 She cried "Oh Willy, don't murder me
 I'm not prepared for eternity"
 
 I took her by her golden curls
 And drug her down to the river side
 And there I threw her into drown
 And I watched her as she floated down
 
 And only say that you'll be mine
 In no others arms entwined
 Down beside where the waters flow
 Down by the banks of the Ohio
 
 And going home between twelve and one
 I cried "Oh Lord, what have I've done?"
 I've killed the only girl I love
 Because she would not marry me
 
 And only say that you'll be mine
 In no others arms entwined
 Down beside where the waters flow
 Down by the banks of the Ohio
 
 Wish I had a known ya
 When you were a little younger
 Around me you might have learned
 a thing or two
 If I had known you longer
 You might be a little Stronger
 And maybe you'd shoot straighter 
 Then you doooo
 Maybe you'd shoot straighter 
 Then you do
 
 As he walked into the poolroom
 You could tell he didn't fit
 In his handmade boots, custom suits
 and pearl handled shooting stick
 Tonight there'd be a showdown
 then everyone would know
 Who shoots the meanest game around
 The Baron or Billy Joe
 Billy Joe looked Edgy
 About to lose his cool
 But the Baron's hands were steady
 As the two began to duel
 Yeah he was like a general
 on a battlefield of slate
 And he'd say to Billy Joe 
 each time he sunk the eight
 He'd Say
 
 Wish I had a known ya
 When you were a little younger
 Around me you might have learned
 a thing or two
 If I had known you longer
 You might be a little Stronger
 And maybe you'd shoot straighter 
 Then you doooo
 Maybe you'd shoot straighter 
 Then you do
 
 Now Billy Joe was busted
 But he hadn't felt the sting
 And from the far end of the table
 He threw his mother's wedding ring
 And he said you won my money
 But it ain't gonna do the trick
 I'll bet this ring on one more game
 against your fancy stick
 The Baron's eyes got foggy
 as the ring rolled on the felt
 And he almost doubled over
 Like he had been hit below the belt
 Twenty years ago 
 It was the ring his wife had worn
 And he didn't know before he left
 that a son would soon be born
 It sounded just like thunder
 when the Baron shot the break
 But it grew thickly quiet
 as He lined up the eight
 Then a warm hand touched his shoulder
 and it chilled him to the bone
 When he turned and saw the woman
 Who had loved him for so long
 The game was never finished
 The eight ball never fell
 The Baron calmly picked it up
 and put it on the shelf
 Then he placed the ring 
 In the hands that held him long ago
 and he tossed that fancy shooting stick
 To his son Billy Joe
 And he said
 
 Wish I had a known ya
 When you were a little younger
 Around me you might have learned
 a thing or two
 If I had known you longer
 You might be a little Stronger
 And maybe you'd shoot straighter 
 Then you doooo
 Maybe you'd shoot straighter 
 Then you do
 
 The beast in me
 Is caged by frail and fragile bars
 Restless by day
 And by night rants and rages at the stars
 God help the beast in me
 
 The beast in me
 Has had to learn to live with pain
 And how to shelter from the rain
 And in the twinkling of an eye
 Might have to be restrained
 God help the beast in me
 
 Sometimes it tries to kid me
 That it's just a teddy bear
 And even somehow manage to vanish in the air
 And that is when I must beware
 Of the beast in me 
 That everybody knows
 They've seen him out dressed in my clothes
 Patently unclear
 If it's New York or New Year
 God help the beast in me
 
 The beast in me
 
 I think sir the battle is over and the young soldier laid down his gun 
 I'm tired of running for cover I'm certain the bottle is done 
 For see over there where we fought them it's quiet for they've all gone away 
 All left is the dead and the dying the Blue laying long side the Gray 
 So you think the battle is over and you even lay down your gun 
 You carelessly rise from your cover for you think the battle is done 
 Now boy hit the dirt listen to me for I'm still the one in command 
 Get flat on the ground here beside me and lay your ear hard to the sand 
 Can you hear the deafening rumble can you feel the trembling ground 
 It's not just the horses and wagons that make such a deafening sound 
 For every shot fired had an echo and every man killed wanted life 
 There lies your friend Jim McKenney can you take the news to his wife 
 No son the battle's not over the battle has only begun 
 The rest of the battle will cover the part that has blackened the sun 
 The fight yet to come's not with cannon nor will the fight be hand to hand 
 No one will regroup the forces no charge will a general command 
 The battle will rage in the bosom of mother and sweetheart and wife 
 Brother and sister and daughter will grieve for the rest of their lives 
 Now go ahead rise from your cover be thankful that God let you live 
 Go fight the rest of the battle for those who gave all they could give 
 I see sir the battle's not over the battle has only begun 
 The rest of the battle will cover this part that has blackened the sun 
 For though there's no sound of the cannon and though there's no smoke in the sky 
 I'm dropping the gun and the sabre and ready for battle am I
 
 There's a blizzard comin' on and I'm wishin' I was home
 For my pony's lame and he can't hardly stand
 Lord my hands feel like they're froze and there's a numbness in my toes
 But it's only seven miles to Mary Anne it's only seven miles to Mary Anne
 
 You can bet we're on her mind for it's nearly suppertime
 And I know that there's hot biscuits in the pan
 Listen to that northern sigh if we don't get home we'll die
 But it's only five more miles to Mary Anne it's only five more miles to Mary Anne
 
 That wind's howlin' and it seems mighty like a woman's screams
 And we'd best be movin' faster if we can
 Dan just think about that barn with that hay so soft and warm
 It's only three more miles to Mary Anne it's only three more miles to Mary Anne
 
 Come on Dan get up your ornery cuss or you'll be the death of us
 I'm so weary but I'll help you if I can
 All right Dan perhaps it's best we'll just stop awhile and rest
 For it's still another mile to Mary Anne it's still another mile to Mary Anne
 
 Late that night the storm was gone and they found him there at dawn
 He made it but he couldn't leave ol' Dan
 Yes they found him on the plains his hands froze into the reins
 He was just a hundred yards from Mary Anne
 He was just a hundred yards from Mary Anne
 
 
 I live in the cemetery ol' caretaker they call me 
 In the wintertime I rake the leaves and in the summer I cut the weeds 
 When a funeral comes the people cry and pray 
 They bury their dead and they all go away 
 But through their grief I still can see their hate and greed and jealousy 
 So here I work and I somehow hide from a world that rushes by outside 
 And each night when I rest my head I'm contented as the peaceful death 
 But who's gonna cry when old John dies who's gonna cry when old John dies 
 Once I was a young man dashing with the girls 
 Now no one wants an old man I lost my handsome curls 
 But I want to say when my time comes lay me facing the rising sun 
 Put me in the corner where where I buried my pup 
 Tell the preacher to pray then cover me up 
 Don't lay flowers where my head should be maybe God let some grow for me 
 And all the little children that I love like my own 
 Will they be sorry that old John's gone 
 Who's gonna cry when old John dies who's gonna cry when old John dies
 
 On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth 
 And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people hail the king 
 Whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was 
 In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus 
 
 A mass of people movin' here and there I wandered where 
 On every face at every place was hurry up I'm late 
 But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said merry Christmas mate 
 And I felt the Christmas spirit 
 
 In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany 
 I walked along to see what the feeling there would be 
 And here again was the busy din the rushin' the yellin' 
 But some kind boy said Frohliche Weihnachten 
 Not undesratnding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin' 
 I felt the Christmas spirit 
 
 In Bethlehem I heard a hymn some distant choir sang 
 And with other tourists I walked along to a church as its bells rang 
 Then I heard someone tell someone there's where Christ was born 
 I wonder if he looked like our baby looked on that first morn 
 
 And then I really felt the Christmas spirit 
 From a businessman in the Holy Land as a sidewalk souvenir shop 
 I bought a little Bible since I'd hardly stopped 
 And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out 
 
 And as I flipped the pages I saw these words and I knew what it was all about 
 For I read fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy 
 Which shall be to all people 
 For unto you he was born this day in the City of David a Saviour 
 Which is Christ the Lord 
 
 Then I took the little Holy Book held it close and tight 
 I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night 
 So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day 
 I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay 
 
 (O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lie 
 Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by 
 Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light 
 The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight)
 
 There are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men that toil for gold
 The Arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold
 The Northern Lights have seen queer sights but the queerest they ever did see
 Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge I cremated Sam McGee
 
 Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee where the cotton blooms and blows
 Why he left his home in the South to roam round the Pole God only knows
 He was always cold but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell
 Though he'd often say in his homely way that he'd sooner live in hell
 
 On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail
 Talk of your cold through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail
 If our eyes we'd close then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see
 It wasn't much fun but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee
 
 And that very night as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow
 And the dogs were fed and the stars o'er head were dancing heel and toe
 He turned to me and Cap says he I'll cash in this trip I guess
 And if I do I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request
 
 Well he seemed so low that I couldn't say no then he says with a sort of moan
 It's the cursed cold and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone
 Yet taint being dead it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains
 So I want you to swear that foul or fair you'll cremate my last remains
 
 A pal's last need is a thing to heed so I swore I would not fail
 And we started on at the break of dawn but God! he looked ghastly pale
 He crouched on the sleigh and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee
 And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee
 
 With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid and I hurried horror-driven
 There wasn't a breath in that land of death because of a promise given
 It was lashed to the sleigh and it seemed to say you may tax your brawn and brains
 But you promised true and it's up to you to cremate those last remains
 
 Now a promise made is a debt unpaid and the trail has its own stern code
 In the days to come though my lips were dumb in my heart how I cursed that load
 In the long long night by the lone firelight while the huskies round in a ring
 Howled out their woes to the homeless snows oh God! how I loathed the thing
 
 And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow
 And on I went though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low
 The trail was bad and I felt half mad but I swore I would not give in
 And I'd often sing to the hateful thing and it hearkened with a grin
 
 Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge and a derelict there lay
 It was jammed in the ice but I saw in a thrice it was called the Alice May
 And I looked at it and I thought a bit and I looked at my frozen chum
 Then Here said I with a sudden cry is my crematorium
 
 Some planks I tore from the cabin floor and I lit the boiler fire
 Some coal I found that was lying around and I heaped the fuel higher
 The flames just soared and the furnace roared such a blaze you never did see
 And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal and I stuffed in Sam McGee
 
 Then I made a hike for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so
 And the heavens scowled and the huskies howled and the wind began to blow
 It was icy cold but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks and I don't know why
 And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky
 
 I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear
 But the stars came out and they danced about before I ventured near
 I was sick with dread but I bravely said: I'll just take a peep inside
 I guess he's cooked and it's time I looked then the door I opened wide
 
 And there sat Sam looking cool and calm in the heart of the furnace roar
 And he wore a smile you could see a mile and he said please close that door
 It's fine in here but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm
 Since I left Plumtree down in Tennessee this is the first time I've been warm
 
 There are strange things done in the midnight sun by the men that toil for gold
 The Arctic trails have their secret tales that would make your blood run cold
 The Northern Lights have seen queer sights but the queerest they ever did see
 Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge I cremated Sam McGee
 
 Go on girl take your chances
 See how long you can go on from man to man
 I can read the lines between your stolen glances
 And I know it's time to fold this loosing hand
 'Cause you're drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame
 Of the cheatin' game they taught you how to play
 You've got nothing to lose but your soul girl
 And you've only the devil to pay
 
 You've been flying so high you don't know
 That you're blind to the writin' on the wall
 But some day you'll look down
 And you'll find you've got no place to fall
 When the bright lights're gone you'll be standing alone
 Forsaken in the naked light of day
 Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying
 And you've still got the devil to pay
 
 Join your friends while you got 'em
 'Cause you know they're gettin' fewer every day
 You can't wait to let them take you to the bottom
 And I'm gettin' tired of standin' in your way
 But when you hit the ground don't come looking around
 For the pieces of the love you threw away
 That's the price of the high life you're livin'
 And you still got the devil to pay
 
 You've been flying so high
 
 About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war
 I saw my first pistol in the general store
 In the general store, when I was thirteen
 Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
 
 So l asked if I could have one when I grew up
 Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up
 She really blew up and I didn't understand
 Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
 She really blew up and I didn't understand
 Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
 The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
 Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
 
 My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt
 Shoot as fast as lightnin' but it loads a mite slow
 Loads a mite slow and i soon found out
 It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
 So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45
 Called a peacemaker but I never knew why
 Never knew why, I didn't understand
 Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
 Never knew why, I didn't understand
 Cause Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
 The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
 Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand
 
 Well I get into a card game in a company town
 Caught a miner cheating I shot the dog down
 Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
 Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
 The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
 Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
 Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
 Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
 Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
 Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
 the devil's right hand, the devil's right hand
 Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
 
 A little child on a sickbed lay
 And death was very near
 He was the pride and the only child
 Of a railroad engineer
 
 His duty had called him from those he loved
 And seeing that hope was dim
 While a tear he shed to his wife, he said
 "Just have two lanterns trimmed"
 
 Just hang a light when I pass tonight
 Hang it where it can be seen
 If the baby's dead then show the red
 If he's better then show the green
 
 In a little shack by the railroad track
 A mother with watchful eyes
 Saw a gleam of hope in a tender smile
 As the train went rushing by
 
 Just one short look was his only chance
 To see the light a gleam
 In the midnight air, there rose a prayer
 Thank God the light was green
 
 Just hang a light when I pass tonight
 Hang it where it can be seen
 If the baby's dead then show the red
 If he's better then show the green
 
 While traveling this land from border to border and from sea to sea
 There have a few occasions to leave the beaten path and to find the place
 And quiet that's good for thought and just walking through a trackless forest
 Or exploring ruins of the earliest settlers or walking along a creekbed
 
 Hoping to find a relic such as a tomahawk an axe
 Or even an arrowhead left by a race of long since vanished Indians
 There's a great thrill and it's a wonderful feeling to find a flint arrowhead
 
 Over fields of new turned sod and in communion with my God I walked alone
 In a furrow bed I found an arrowhead chiseled from stone
 I don't know how long ago some redman drew his bow on its last fight
 Or did he drop it here afraid white men were near to attack at night
 
 I do know this one thing beyond all questioning it was made to kill
 And proof of a master trade is in this arrowhead he made fashioned with skill
 That I inherited this ground is denied by this stone I've found but when and by who
 Come join me in my tracks then let's stop and look back to the vale and through
 
 In love and peace we'll see the shadows and the trees and voices too
 But quietly slowly tread this home of the forgotten dead whose bones are dust
 I'm proud that their craftsmen's skill survives the ages still left in my trust
 
 Refrain:
 They wouldn't bend
 They held on to the will of God so we are told
 They wouldn't bow
 They would not bow their knees to Idols made of gold
 They wouldn't burn
 They were protected by the Fourth Man in the fire
 They wouldn't bend
 They wouldn't bow, they wouldn't burn.
 
 Now the prophet Daniel tells about
 Three men who walked with God
 Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
 Before the wicked king they stood
 And the king commanded them bound and thrown
 Into the fiery furnace that day
 But the fire was so hot that the men were slain
 That forced them on their way.
 
 Refrain:
 
 Now when the three were cast in and the king rose up
 To witness this awful fate
 He began to tremble at what he saw
 In astonished tones he spake
 Did we not cast three men bound
 Into the midst of the fire
 Well, Lo, I see four men unhurt
 Unbound and walkin' down there;
 
 There's Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
 And the fiery coals they trod
 But the form of the Fourth Man that I see
 Is like the Son of God
 
 
 About 20 years ago, on a train bound for nowhere,
 I met up with The Gambler; We were both too tired to sleep.
 So we took turns a starin' through the window at the darkness.
 Til' boredom overtook us and he commenced to speak. 
 
 He said: "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
 "And knowin' what their cards were, by the way they held their eyes.
 "And if you don't mind my sayin', I would say you're out of aces;
 "And for one taste of your whiskey, I will give you some advice." 
 
 So I handed him my bottle, and he drank down my last swallow.
 Then he bummed a cigarette; then he bummed a light.
 The night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression.
 He said: "If you're gonna play the game, boy, you better learn to play it right." 
 
 "'Cos ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survival,
 "Is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep.
 "And ev'ry hand's a winner, just like ev'ry hand's a loser.
 "And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep. 
 
 "You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
 "Know when to walk away; know when to run.
 "You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
 "There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done."
 
 "You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
 "Know when to walk away; know when to run.
 "You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
 "There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done." 
 
 And when he finished speakin', he turned back t'ward the window.
 Put out his cigarette; faded off to sleep.
 And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler he broke even.
 But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
 
 "You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
 "Know when to walk away; know when to run.
 "You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
 "There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done." 
 
 "You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
 "Know when to walk away; know when to run.
 "You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
 "There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done." 
 
 "You got to know when to hold 'em; know when to fold 'em.
 "Know when to walk away; know when to run.
 "You don't ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table.
 "There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done."
 
 I'm a charger that charges through the night,
 Like an orange bolt of lightning passing everything in sight.
 I'm the best pal that you boys ever had,
 I'm thunder on the highway lookin' bad, bad, bad.
 
 I'm a knight, like the kind in shining armor,
 With my polished body gleaming, I'm a fighter and a charmer.
 If trouble comes your way just ask for me,
 My friends all know me as General Lee.
 
 I'm the Gerneral Lee,
 A pistol pumpin', steel belted cavalry.
 I'll never let you down when you're riding with me;
 Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean.
 Take a look back there:
 Sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere;
 We'll cross the fields and we'll be running free,
 They'll eat dust compliments of me:
 
 The General Lee
 
 I'm a hero, and that's how I'll make you feel
 When you're riding shotgun with me and the law is at your heels.
 I'm glory bound, but when the chase is done,
 I'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun.
 
 I've got style, tearing through the curves;
 Let my flag wave proudly to the people that I serve.
 I'm number one, and I will always be
 The pride of the South they call the General Lee.
 
 I'm the Gerneral Lee,
 A pistol pumpin', steel belted cavalry.
 I'll never let you down when you're riding with me;
 Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean.
 Take a look back there:
 Sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere;
 I'll jump that pond and we'll be running free,
 And they'll go swimmin', compliments of me:
 
 The General Lee
 The General Lee
 General Lee
 
 The good earth swallows up the seed and swallows life as well
 From long before the day you're born till heaven comes or hell
 It binds your hands with chains of clay that are so hard to break
 But when I left good earth behind I made a big mistake
 
 I've traveled far and traveled wide
 I've seen a lot of things
 But looking back on all the years
 I don't know what they mean
 Like steel I'm probably stronger
 From going through the fire
 I kept on climbin' lower
 Diggin' deeper to get higher
 
 I turned around one evening when the sun was going down
 I heard the Bible told a preacher who just pulled into town
 At last I'm back on good earth where I should have always been
 Lord forgive me if I ever try to leave good earth again
 
 Well the good earth was my mama and my daddy too
 Now I'm working my hands in soil tryin' to pay my due
 And when I'll breathe my last breath which may not be too long
 Just shovel a little good earth over my head
 'Til everybody open up the hymn book and sing a happy song
 
 Shall we gather at the river in the sweet by and by
 Just as I am Jesus loves me one of these days I'll fly
 I'm standing on the promises Lord build the place for me
 In the good earth over Jordan by the Sea of Galilee mhm
 
 If you should meet some lonely soul,
 Who on this earth can't reach his goal,
 And he's traveling on a road, 
 So dark and dim,
 Lend a hand, say a prayer, 
 Give a smile that he might share,
 But for the grace of God, 
 It could be you instead of him.
 
 Befriend each stranger in the night,
 Help to make his burdens light,
 Lift up the fallen ones and be a friend,
 Shed a tear, share a sigh, 
 Share his fears, don't pass him by,
 But for the grace of God, 
 It could be you instead of him.
 
 What a beautiful thought I am thinking
 Concerning the great speckled bird
 And to know that my name is recorded
 On the pages of God's holy word
 
 Desiring to lower her standards
 They watch every move that she makes
 They long to find fault with her teaching
 But really she makes no mistakes
 
 I am glad I have learned of her meekness
 I am glad that my name is on her book
 For I want to be one never fearing
 The face of my Savior to look
 
 And when He come descending from Heaven
 On a cloud like He said in His word
 I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
 On the wings of the great speckled bird
 
 I was a highwayman
 Along the coach roads I did ride
 With sword and pistol by my side
 Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
 Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
 The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
 But I am still alive
 
 I was a sailor
 I was born upon the tide
 And with the sea I did abide
 I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
 I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
 And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
 But I am living still
 
 I was a dam builder
 Across the river deep and wide
 Where steel and water did collide
 A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
 I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
 They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
 But I am still around
 I'll always be around and around and around and around and around
 
 I fly a starship
 Across the Universe divide
 And when I reach the other side
 I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
 Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
 Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
 But I will remain
 And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again
 
 Man had need of shelter from the evil from the night
 The devil wind was blowin and from heaven came a light
 The Son of god a carpenter and he came with a plan
 To build a house where heaven could be offered unto man
 
 When he came here he laid down a mighty firm foundation
 And the columns and the beams were churches scattered through the nations
 And then rooms were added to it on that same old solid rock
 And roofs were raised by willing hands from the bottom to the top
 
 Then people came and filled the house with singin prayer and praise
 Some turned and rejected his house fell on meaner days
 O Son of God! O Carpenter! Will you come back around?
 The blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is falling down
 
 Now the storm is ragin' and the devil's angry roar
 Is screaming at the windows and howling at the door
 And though the faithful few inside are standing true and strong
 The house has been neglected and it won't be standing long
 
 When he came here he laid down a mighty firm foundation
 And the columns and the beams were churches scattered through the nations
 And then rooms were added to it on that same old solid rock
 And roofs were raised by willing hands from the bottom to the top
 
 Then people came and filled the house with singin prayer and praise
 Some turned and rejected his house fell on meaner days
 O Son of God! O Carpenter! Will you come back around?
 Our blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is falling down
 O Son of God! O Carpenter! Will you come back around?
 The blocks and beams are crumbling and the house is falling down
 
 
 I was a stumble bummin' down the neon Music City sidewalks
 With the Junkie and the Juicehead who had problems of their own
 Stuck with luck it kept me standin' just a step away from starvin'
 And the talent that I swore I'd show before I'd go back home
 
 Ninety days I looked the army makin' neither love nor money
 And my only set of clothes was gettin' closer to the bone
 And the Junkie placed an order with the Prophet on the corner
 And he told him of the soul that he'd been sellin' for a song
 
 He said my future was my fortune but I let it slip away
 Slowly smokin' myself broke on eighty cigarettes a day
 Findin' out that crime ain't all there is that doesn't pay
 And writin' words that no one's gonna see but did you said it who said it
 
 I can read my fortune in the bottom of a glass
 And I can see it's time for me to make my last request
 Won't you fill my grave with whiskey when I'm laid away to rest
 So the boys can say I drank myself to dead
 Well I drank the whole thing over puttin' one and two together
 And it added up to more of what I didn't want to be
 I ain't blamin' Music City but it's only gonna see me
 One more day and the wake up and the time it takes to leave
 
 'Cause I got a dirty picture of what could have been my future
 In a Prophet pushin' day dreams on a corner for a fee
 And the wino lookin' lonely at a bottle gettin' empty
 And a hungry lookin' junkie huntin' tea in sympathy
 
 And I bet that junkie's laughin' after the life he threw away
 Slowly smokin' himself broke on eighty cigarettes a day
 Pleadin' down the Prophet to a price that he can pay
 And writin' words that no one's gonna see but did you said it who said it
 
 Every empty bottle is my private crystal ball
 And starin' into the future findin' nothin' there at all
 Which is what I'll miss tomorrow when the neon shadows fall
 On the Junkie and the Juicehead minus me
 
 
 When I was a curly headed baby
 My daddy sat me down upon his knee
 He said, "Boy, you go to school and learn your letters
 Don't you be a dirty miner like me"
 
 I was born and raised in the mouth of the Hazard Hollow
 Coal cars rambled past my door
 Now they're standin' in a rusty row all empty
 And the L & N
 Don't stop here anymore
 
 I used to think my daddy was a black man
 With script enough to buy the company store
 Now he goes downtown with empty pockets
 And his face is white as a February snow
 
 I was born and raised in the mouth of the Hazard Hollow
 Coal cars rambled past my door
 Now they're standin' in a rusty row all empty
 And the L & N
 Don't stop here anymore
 
 Last night I dreamed I went down to the coal yard
 To draw my pay like I always did before
 But them ol' kudzu vines were comin' through the window
 And the leaves and grass were growin' through the floor
 
 I was born and raised in the mouth of the Hazard Hollow
 Coal cars rambled past my door
 Now they're standin' in a rusty row all empty
 And the L & N
 Don't stop here anymore
 
 Anybody got any special requests for us to do
 John Henry?
 Lemme do John Henry then and we'll go...
 
 Johnny Henry's pappy woke him up one midnight
 He said "Before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you," Said "Listen boy
 Learn to hoist a jack and learn to lay a track learn to pick and shovel too
 And take that hammer, It'll do anything you tell it to."
 
 John Henry's mammy had about a dozen babies
 John Henry's pappy broke jail about a dozen times
 The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money
 He said, "I'll pay you a quarter at a time starting tomorrow
 That's the pay for a steel driver on this line."
 
 Then the section foreman said, "Hey! Hammer-swinger!
 I see you your own hammer boy but, what all can them muscles do?" and he said,
 "I can hoist a jack I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too."
 He said "Can you swing a hammer" He said "do anything you hire me to."
 
 "Now ain't you something! So high and mighty with all that muscle!"
 Go ahead, boy. Pick up that hammer, and show me what you can do!"
 
 He said to get a rusted spike and swing it down three times
 Pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to
 Go on and do what you say you can do
 
 With a steel-nosed hammer on a four foot switch handle
 John Henry raised it back 'til it touched his heels then
 The spike went through the cross-tie and split it half in two
 Thirty-five cents a day for driving steel
 Said "Sweat, boy! Sweat! Only two more swings!"
 "I was born drivin' steel"
 
 Well now John Henry hammered in the mountains
 He'd give a grunt he give a groan every swing
 The women-folks from miles around heard him and come down
 To watch make the cold-steel ring "Lord! What a swinger!
 Watch him make the cold-steel ring"
 
 But the bad boss came up laughin' at John Henry
 He said, "You full of vinegar now but you bout' through!
 We gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin'
 Then what's all them muscles gonna do? Huh? John Henry?
 Gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you."
 
 John Henry said, "I feed four little brothers
 And baby sisters' walkin' on her knees
 Now did the Lord say that machines ought to take place of the livin'?
 And what's a substitute for bread and beans? I ain't seen it!
 Do engines get rewarded for their steam?
 
 John Henry said to his captain said "A man ain't nothin' but a man
 But if you'll bring that steamdrill 'round I'll beat it fair and honest.
 I'll die with that hammer in my hand but, I'll be laughin',
 Cause you can't replace a steel-drivin' man.
 
 There was a big crowd of people at the mountain.
 John Henry said to the steam-drill "How is you?
 Said pardon me, Mister Steamdrill I suppose you didn't hear me.
 I said how are you Huh?
 Can you turn a jack? Can you lay a track? Can you pick and shovel too?
 Listen, this hammer-swinger's talkin' to you.
 
 Two-thousand people hollered, "Go John Henry!"
 Then somebody hollered," The mountain's cavin' in!"
 John Henry told the captin, "Tell the kind-folks not to worry
 It ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind, it keeps me breathin'
 This steel-driver's muscle it ain't thin.
 
 "Captain tell the people to move back farther
 I'm at the finish line and ain't no drill
 It's so far behind that it don't got the brains to quit it
 When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills Lord, Lord
 When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills"
 
 Now, John Henry had a little woman
 I believe the lady's name was Paulie Ann yeah that was his good woman
 John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home
 Early next mornin' he said,
 "Come here Paulie Ann, come here sugar.
 Said you know I been laying here, watching that sun come up
 And I believe this is the first time I've seen the sun come up
 That I couldn't come up with it
 He said, ,
 He said take that hammer, Paulie Ann and go to that railroad
 And when you swinging with that lead man
 You tell em that's not all I can do. Tell em,
 I can hoist a jack and I can lay a track I can pick and shovel too.
 Ain't no machine can that's been proved to you!
 
 There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house
 The section hands laid him in the sand
 Trains go by on the rails John Henry laid.
 They slow down and take off the hats,
 When they come to whoreys lynn retsina' his back.
 They say,"Mornin' Steel-driver, you sure was a hammer-swinger."
 Then they go on by pickin' up a little bit of speed.
 Clickity clack
 
 Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord
 Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man
 
 Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man lord lord
 Yonder lies a steel-drivin' man
 
 Yonder lies a steel-drivin'
 
 Thank you very much
 You know John Honey was a real man. He worked on a tunnel in West Virginia
 Digin' a tunnel for the San Jose railroad.
 And he was a mighty big man they say
 That from his heels, on around to the ground he had a stroke of 19 feet
 Boy that's a long stroke. Wooo that's a long stroke
 
 I was standing by the window yesterday morning,
 Without a thought of worry or regret
 When I saw the postman coming down the pathway
 He was bringing me a letter edged in black
 He rang the bell and whistled while he waited,
 And then he said, Good morning to you, Jack.
 But he never knew the sorrow he had brought me
 When he handed me the letter edged in black.
 
 With trembling hand I took the letter from him,
 I broke the seal, and this is what it said:
 Come home, my boy, your dear old father wants you,
 Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead.
 
 The last words your mother ever uttered,
 Were tell my boy I want him to come back.
 My eyes are dimmed, my poor old heart is breaking,
 And I'm writing you this letter edged in black.
 
 I bow my head in sadness and in silence,
 The sunlight of my life it all has fled,
 Since the postman brought that letter yesterday morning,
 Saying come home, my boy, your poor old mother's dead.
 
 Those angry words I wish I'd never spoken,
 You know I never meant them, don't you, Jack?
 May the angels bear me witness, I am asking
 Your forgiveness in this letter edged in black.
 
 I have found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me
 He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
 He's the Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see
 All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole
 
 In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay
 And He tells me every care on Him to roll
 He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star
 He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul
 
 He will never, never leave me nor yet forsake me here
 While I live by faith and do His blessed will
 There's a wall of fire about me and I've nothing now to fear
 With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill
 
 And then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face
 Where rivers of delight shall ever roll
 He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star
 He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul

 Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
 Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
 There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
 That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me
 
 She walks these hills in a long black veil
 She visits my grave when the night winds wail
 Nobody knows, nobody sees
 Nobody knows but me
 
 The judge said son, what is your alibi
 If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
 I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
 I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
 
 Did I hear someone applaud?
 
 Now the scaffold is high and eternity's near
 She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
 But sometimes at night, when the north wind moans
 In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones
 
 She walks these hills in a long black veil
 She visits my grave when the night winds wail
 Nobody knows, nobody sees
 Nobody knows but me
 
 Can I have a glass of water?
 huh? Alright
 Lemme have a, have a drink of water. I'm about to choke up
 That's cocaine blues.
 We got a special surprise for, you fellas
 And especially for one fella.
 In a few minutes we're going to record a brand new song that
 I just sang last night for the first time
 It was written by someone here in Folsom prison
 Can I have a drink of water?
 Last time, last time I was here I had a drink of water
 And uh, I don't know what the hell it run off
 I think it must have run off Luther's boots or something
 Is that water?
 You promise that's water, huh
 Is that water bob?
 That's water
 Serve everything in tin cups?
 He caught it, didn't he?
 I have an announcement here
 Sandoval, Sandoval, S-A-N-D-O-V-A-L. Sandoval
 Eighty eight four one nine is wanted in reception
 
 You gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
 You gave me a song I learned to sing
 You showed me some beauty through the windows of your soul
 And you showed me a world I've never seen
 
 Each giving to the other love and givin' it away
 We spent the precious time we knew was borrowed
 'Cause you gave me the courage to live with yesterday
 And you gave me tomorrow
 
 You brought me a candle to light my way to bed
 You erased those shadows I'd been seeing
 You brought me a pillow to rest my weary head
 You taught me a gentle way of dreaming
 
 And even if you leave me I'll be richer when you go
 I'm richer with the loving gift you gave me
 'Cause you gave me a blanket to keep me from the cold
 And you gave me a baby
 
 
 "And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder
 One of the four beasts saying,
 'Come and see.' and I saw, and behold a white horse"
 
 There's a man goin' 'round takin' names
 And he decides who to free and who to blame
 Everybody won't be treated all the same
 There'll be a golden ladder reachin' down
 When the man comes around
 
 The hairs on your arm will stand up
 At the terror in each sip and in each sup
 Will you partake of that last offered cup
 Or disappear into the potter's ground?
 When the man comes around
 
 Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
 One hundred million angels singin'
 Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
 Voices callin', voices cryin'
 Some are born and some are dyin'
 It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
 And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
 The virgins are all trimming their wicks
 The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
 It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
 
 Till armageddon no shalam, no shalom
 Then the father hen will call his chickens home
 The wise man will bow down before the throne
 And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
 When the man comes around
 
 Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
 Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
 Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
 Listen to the words long written down
 When the man comes around
 
 Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
 One hundred million angels singin'
 Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
 Voices callin', voices cryin'
 Some are born and some are dyin'
 It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
 And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
 The virgins are all trimming their wicks
 The whirlwind is in the thorn trees
 It's hard for thee to kick against the prick
 In measured hundredweight and penny pound
 When the man comes around
 
 "And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts
 And I looked, and behold a pale horse
 And his name that sat on him was death, and hell followed with him"
 
 Will we get cold and hungry will times be very bad 
 When we're needin' bread and meat where we gonna get it dad 
 We'll get it from the man in the house on the hill 
 Yes we will from the man on the hill 
 Ploughin' time is over still the fields are bare 
 How we gonna make a livin' with twenty acres to share 
 I'll beg for more land from the man on the hill yes I will I'll ask the man on the hill 
 I ain't got no Sunday shoes that I can wear to town 
 Papa reckon the boss has got a pair of hand-me-downs 
 I'll go and ask the man in the house on the hill yes I will I'll ask the man on the hill 
 Maybe he will help us maybe we'll get by 
 But who's gonna pay the dyin' bills if we all should die 
 We'll leave it to the man in the sky when we die 
 Yes we'll leave it to the man in the sky
 
 There once was a man and he couldn't cry 
 He hadn't cried for years and for years
 Napalmed babies, movie love stories
 For instance could not produce tears
 As a child he had cried as all children will
 Then at some point his tear ducts all ran dry
 Grew to be a man, it all hit the fan
 Things got bad, but he couldn't cry
 
 His dog got ran over, his wife up and left him
 After that he got sacked from his job
 Lost his arm in the war, was laughed at by a whore
 Ah, but still not a sniffle or sob
 
 Well, his novel was refused, and his movie was panned
 His big Broadway show was a flop
 
 He got sent off to jail, you guessed it, no bail
 Oh, but still not a dribble or a drop
 
 In jail he was beaten, bullied and buggered
 And made to make license plates
 Water and bread was all he was fed
 Not once did a tear stain his face
 
 Doctors were called in, scientists, too
 Theologians were last and practically least
 
 They all agreed sure enough, this is no cream puff
 Oh, but in fact an insensitive beast
 
 He was taken from the jail and placed in a place
 For the insensitive and the insane
 He made a lot of friends and he played a lot of chess
 And he cried every time it would rain
 
 Once it rained forty days and it rained forty nights
 And he cried and he cried and he cried and he cried
 
 On the forty first day, he passed away
 He just dehydrated and died
 
 He went up to heaven, located his dog
 After that, he rejoined his arm
 Below all the critics, they took it all back
 Cancer robbed the whore of her charm
 
 His ex-wife died of stretch marks 
 His ex-employer went broke
 The theologians were finally found out
 
 Right down to the ground, the jail house burned down
 And the earth suffered perpetual drought
 
 
 The crowd is waiting for the bullfight, Matador
 My final fight the place is packed once more
 Anita won't throw me a rose this fight
 The one she wears is not for me tonight
 
 She's watching now with her new love I know
 Walk proud and slow
 Be strong and sure give the crowd their show
 They want blood you know
 You're still their idol as you were before
 
 Kill just one more
 Remind Anita
 You're the greatest Matador
 
 Walk on out, forget Anita in the stands
 Be a tall and brave and noble man
 Be better than you've ever been before
 Make this your greatest moment Matador
 
 She's watching now with her new love I know
 Walk proud and slow
 Be strong and sure and give the crowd their show
 They want blood you know
 You're still their idol as you were before
 
 Kill just one more
 Remind Anita
 You're the greatest Matador
 
 It all began when they  took me from my home
 And put me on Death Row
 A crime for which I'm totally innocent, you know
 
 I began to warm and chill
 To objects and their fields
 A ragged cup, a twisted mop
 The face of Jesus in my soup
 Those sinister dinner deals
 The meal trolley's wicked wheels
 A hooked bone rising from my food
 And all things either good or ungood
 
 And the mercy seat is waiting
 And I think my head is burning
 And in a way I'm yearning
 To be done with all this weighing of the truth
 An eye for an eye
 And a tooth for a tooth
 And, anyway, I told the truth
 And I'm not afraid to die.
 
 I hear stories from the chamber
 Christ was born into a manger
 And like some ragged stranger
 He died upon the cross
 Might I say it seems so fitting in its way
 He was a carpenter by trade
 Or at least that's what I'm told
 
 My killed hands tattooed E.V.I.L.
 across it's brother's fist
 That filthy five!
 They did nothing to challenge or resist
 
 In Heaven His throne is made of gold
 The ark of His Testament is stowed
 A throne from which I'm told
 All history does unfold.
 It's made of wood and wire
 And my body is on fire
 And God is never far away
 
 Into the mercy seat I climb
 My head is shaved, my head is wired
 And like a moth that tries
 To enter the bright eye
 I go shuffling out of life
 Just to hide in death awhile
 And, anyway, I never lied
 
 And the mercy seat is waiting
 And I think my head is burning
 And in a way I'm yearning
 To be done with all this weighing of the truth
 An eye for an eye
 And a tooth for a tooth
 And, anyway, I told the truth
 And I'm not afraid to die.
 
 And the mercy seat is burning
 And I think my head is glowing
 And in a way I'm hoping
 To be done with all this twistin' of the truth
 An eye for an eye
 And a tooth for a tooth
 And, anyway, there was no proof
 And I'm not afraid to die
 
 And the mercy seat is glowing
 And I think my head is smokin'
 And in a way I'm hoping
 To be done with all these looks of disbelief.
 A life for a life
 And a truth for a truth
 And I've got nothing left to lose
 And I'm not afraid to die
 
 And the mercy seat is smokin'
 And I think my head is melting
 And in a way that's helping
 To be done with all this twistin' of the truth
 An eye for an eye
 And a truth for a truth
 And, anyway, I told the truth
 But I'm afraid I told a lie.
 
 Peterbilt drivers don't pick up low riders
 They don't slow for the curves in the road
 They hate to keep logs, they hate riders on hogs
 Watch out for a shift in your load
 
 When I was young, I had Gene Autry guns
 But I never had a Lionel train
 Now I've got a truck, if I keep payments up
 And it weighs thirty tons in the rain
 
 I wear Frisco jeans with riveted seams
 My money is chained to my belt
 I wear a Cat cap just like my pap
 He drove till it ruined his health
 
 Now, Georgia Bill Smith wore thick glasses and boots
 He could see 'bout as far as he could walk
 He came up too fast on that bridge overpass
 Lord, the preacher sure gave a fine talk
 
 When I was young, I had Gene Autry guns
 But I never had a Lionel train
 Now I've got a truck if I keep payments up
 And it weighs thirty tons in the rain
 
 I've read a few lines from the poets
 And sometimes, I might cross the line
 I don't know the answer to the mystery of life
 But a woman sure helps pass the time
 
 When I was young, I had Gene Autry guns
 But I never had a Lionel train
 Now I've got a truck if I keep payments up

 The next in line will be someone who loves you
 The next in line is me, 'cause it's my time
 Now how long will it be, 'til you end my misery
 You better be prepared to linger, when you get to me
 
 The time has come for you to love me, if you ever are
 Come to me now, so I can make you mine
 I watched them rush to you so fast
 I waited so I'd be the last
 It's my time, 'cause I'm the next in line
 
 The next in line will hold your love forever
 The next in line is me and here I am
 Give me a day or two and I'll get through to you
 You'd been my baby long ago, if you'd turned down a few
 
 This old heart can't take much more waitin' for your love
 I'm tired and we're runnin' short of time
 I'll make you love me more than everyone before
 It's my time to try, 'cause I'm the next in line
 
 I stood and watched you take their hearts
 And break 'em one by one
 My time is comin', so I waited while you had your fun
 
 Now I'm through a-waitin' way behind
 It's my time, 'cause I'm the next in line
 
 Harry Truman was our president
 A coke and burger cost you thirty cents
 I was still in love with Mavis Brown
 On the night Hank Williams came to town
 
 I Love Lucy debuted on TV
 That was one big event we didn't see
 'Cause no one stayed at home for miles around
 It was the night Hank Williams came to town
 
 Mama ironed my shirt and daddy let me take the truck
 I drove on out to Grapevine and picked old Mavis up
 We hit that county line for one quick round
 On the night Hank Williams came to town
 
 A thousand people sweltered in the gym
 Then I heard someone whisper hey, that's him
 That's when the crowd let out this deafening sound
 It was the night Hank Williams came to town
 
 On and on he sang into the night
 'Jambalaya', 'Cheatin' heart', I saw the light
 How'd they get Miss Audrey in that gown
 On the night Hank Williams came to town
 
 Mavis had her picture made with Hank outside his car
 She said he sure is humble for a Grand Old Opry Star
 Mavis said why don't we hang around
 It ain't often that Hank Williams comes to town
 
 While Hank signed his autograph on Beaulah Rice's fan
 Mavis got acquainted with the Driftin' Cowboys Band
 The effect on all our lives was quite profound
 On the night Hank Williams came to town
 
 
 On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame 
 And I love that old cross where the dearest and best 
 For a word of lost sinners was slain 
 So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down 
 
 I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown 
 To the old rugged cross I will ever be true it's shame and reproach gladly bear 
 Then he'll call me some day to my home far away where his glory forever I'll share 
 So I'll cherish... 
 
 And exchange it some day for a crown
 
 There once was a musical troupe 
 A pickin' singin' folk group
 They sang the mountain ballads 
 And the folk songs of our land
 
 They were long on musical ability 
 Folks thought they would go far
 But political incompatibility led to their downfall
 
 Well, the one on the right was on the left
 And the one in the middle was on the right
 And the one on the left was in the middle
 And the guy in the rear was a Methodist
 
 This musical aggregation toured the entire nation
 Singing the traditional ballads 
 And the folk songs of our land
 They performed with great virtuosity 
 And soon they were the rage
 But political animosity prevailed upon the stage
 
 Well, the one on the right was on the left
 And the one in the middle was on the right
 And the one on the left was in the middle
 And the guy in the rear burned his driver's license
 
 Well the curtain had ascended 
 A hush fell on the crowd
 As thousands there were gathered to hear The folk songs of our land
 But they took their politics seriously 
 And that night at the concert hall
 As the audience watched deliriously 
 They had a free-for-all
 
 Well, the one on the right was on the bottom
 And the one in the middle was on the top
 And the one on the left got a broken arm
 And the guy in the rear, said, "Oh dear"
 
 Now this should be a lesson if you plan to start a folk group
 Don't go mixin' politics with the folk songs of our land
 Just work on harmony and diction 
 Play your banjo well
 And if you have political convictions keep them to yourself
 
 Now, the one on the left works in a bank
 And the one in the middle drives a truck
 The one on the right's an all-night deejay
 And the guy in the rear got drafted

 So blue 
 Lonesome too 
 But still true
 Rosie haunts me 
 Makes me think of you
 
 You're the one rose that's left in my heart, dear 
 I love you, adore you, I do
 Each night in dreamland we wander along 
 Telling love stories anew 
 When from a blue sky 
 A black cloud came rolling 
 Breaking my heart in two 
 
 Oh we ought not to part 
 I have said from the start 
 You're the one rose that's left in my heart
 
 Oh we ought not to part 
 I have said from the start 
 You're the one rose that's left in my heart
 
 Well with everybody tryin' to tell us what to do
 You wonder how are you to know whose word is true
 But the preacher just keep on a bringing us a very same word
 And from St Paul to Billy Graham the same is heard
 And the preacher said of truth Jesus said
 
 Well we can see that the world is full of greed
 There's so much hate yet there is so much need
 What should we do when no one seems to care
 What can we do when there is no love there
 And then the preacher said of love Jesus said
 
 Well please tell us the road we oughta go in such confusion how are we to know
 And if there is a heaven show us to its gates
 Oh you'd better tell us preacher before it's too late
 And then the preacher said of heaven Jesus said
 (Jesus said seek the first the kingdom of God and his righteousness
 And all these things shall be added unto you)
 Well please tell us we can find a way to climb every mountain that we face every day
 And time of troubles what to depend upon to be the truth and help us carry on
 And the preacher said of trouble Jesus said
 (Jesus said let not your heart be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me
 In my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you
 I go to prepare a place for you
 And if I prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself
 That where I am there you may be also)
 
 
 Oh I wish I had someone to love me, Yes someone to call me their own
 Oh I wish I had someone to live with, ?Cause I'm tired of living all alone
 Please meet me tonight in the moonlight
 Please meet me tonight all alone
 For I have a sad story to tell you
 It's a story that's never been told
 (I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow
 Leaving my poor ol' darling alone)
 With the cold prison bars all around me
 And my head on a pillow of stone
 Now I have a grand ship out on the ocean
 All mounted with silver and gold
 And before my poor darling would suffer
 That ship would be anchored and sold
 Now if I had the wings of an angel
 Over these prison walls I would fly
 And I'd fly to the arms of my poor darling
 And there I'd be willing to die
 
 I feel tears wellin' up
 Cold and deep inside
 Like my heart's sprung a big break
 And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful
 That I may never shake
 You might say that I was takin' it hard
 Oh, she wrote me off with a call
 But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
 When I may break right down and bawl
 
 Well, the race is on
 And here comes pride up the backstretch
 Heartaches are goin' to the inside
 My tears are holdin' back
 They're tryin' not to fall
 My heart's out of the runnin'
 True love's scratched for another's sake
 The race is on and it looks like heartache
 And the winner loses all
 
 One day I ventured in love
 Never once suspectin'
 What the final result would be
 How I lived in fear of wakin' up each mornin'
 Findin' that you're gone from me
 There's ache and pain in my heart
 For today was the one I hated to face
 Somebody new came up to win her
 I wound up in second place
 
 Well, the race is on
 And here comes pride up the backstretch
 Heartaches are goin' to the inside
 My tears are holdin' back
 They're tryin' not to fall
 My heart's out of the runnin'
 True love's scratched for another's sake
 The race is on and it looks like heartache
 And the winner loses all
 
 Away, away, away rolled the rebel Johnny Yuma
 
 Johnny Yuma was a rebel
 He roamed through the west
 And Johnny Yuma, the rebel
 He wandered alone
 
 He got fightin' mad
 This rebel lad
 He packed no star
 As he wandered far
 Where the only law
 Was a hook and a draw
 The rebel, Johnny Yuma 
 
 Johnny Yuma was a rebel
 He roamed through the west
 Johnny Yuma, the rebel
 He wandered alone
 
 He searched the land
 This restless lad
 He was panther quick
 And leather tough
 'Cause he figured that
 He had been pushed enough
 The rebel, Johnny Yuma 
 Johnny Yuma
 
 Johnny Yuma was a rebel
 He roamed through the west
 Johnny Yuma, the rebel
 He wandered alone
 
 Fightin' mad
 This rebel lad
 With a dream he'd hold
 'Til his dyin' breath
 He'd search his soul
 And gamble with death
 The rebel, Johnny Yuma 
 Johnny Yuma
 
  He rode easy in the saddle. He was tall and lean, and at first you'd a-thought nothing but a streak of mean could make a man look so down right strong, but one look in his eyes and you knowed you was wrong. He was a mountain of a man, and I want you to know. He could preach hot hell or freezin' snow. He carried a Bible in a canvas sack and folks just called him The Reverend Mr. Black. He was poor as a beggar, but he rode like a king. Sometimes in the evening, I'd hear him sing:
 
 Chorus:
 I gotta walk that lonesome valley. I got to walk it by myself. Oh nobody else can walk it for me. I got to walk it by myself.
 You got to walk that lonesome valley. You got to walk it by yourself. Oh nobody else can walk it for you. You got to walk it by yourself.
 
 If ever I could have thought this man in black was soft and had any yellow up his back, I gave that notion up the day a lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray. Yeah, he kicked open the meeting house door and he cussed everybody up and down the floor! Then, when things got quiet in the place, he walked up and cusses in the preacher's face! He hit that Reverend like a kick of a mule and to my way of thinkin' it took a real fool to turn the other face to that lumber jack, but that's what he did, The Reverend Mr. Black. He stood like a rock, a man among men and he let that lumberjack hit him again, and then with a voice as quiet as could be, he cut him down like a big oak tree when he said:
 
 It's been many years since we had to part and I guess I learned his ways by heart. I can still hear his sermon's ring, down in the valley where he used to sing. I followed him, yes, sir, and I don't regret it and I hope I will always be a credit to his memory 'cause I want you to understand. The Reverend Mr. Black was my old man!
 
 We're goin' west to Kaintuck, down the road to Moccasin Gap
 Down the wilderness road, down the dug road, the old reedy creek road
 The road down troublesome, the road through Moccasin Gap
 
 Well, it's a hot day in '73 and this is my wife and my kid with me
 Daniel Boone lost his boy the other day
 Young Jim Boone's dead, now twenty miles away
 
 Well, if you love your wife and love your baby, man
 You better turn that wagon back as soon as you can
 Every Injun in them hills has gone berserk
 And you never gonna make it to Kaintuck
 Ah, I bet I'm gonna make it to Kaintuck
 
 I'm goin' west to Kaintuck, down the road to Moccasin Gap
 Down the wilderness road, down the dug road, the old reedy creek road
 The road down troublesome, the road through Moccasin Gap
 
 I was born the running kind
 With leaving always on my mind
 Home was never home to me
 At anytime
 Every front door found me hoping
 I would find the back door open
 There just had to be an exit for the running kind
 
 Within me there's a prison
 Surrounding me alone
 As real as any dungeon
 With its wall of stone
 I know running's not the answer
 Though, running's been my nature
 And a thing in me that keeps me moving on
 
 I was born the running kind
 With leaving always on my mind
 Home was never home to me
 At anytime
 Every front door found me hoping
 I would find the back door open
 There just had to be an exit for the running kind
 
 I was born the running kind
 With leaving always on my mind
 Home was never home to me
 At anytime
 Every front door found me hoping
 I would find the back door open
 There just had to be an exit for the running kind
 
 
 
 Sequoia's winters were sixteen silent tongue spirit clean 
 He walked at his father's side 
 Across the smoking battle ground where red and white men lay all around 
 So many here had died 
 The wind had scattered around snow white leaves upon the ground 
 Not leaves like leaves from trees 
 Sequoia said what can this be what's the strange thing here I see 
 From where come leaves like these 
 Sequoia turned to his father's eyes and he said father you're wise 
 From where come such snow white leaves 
 With such strange marks upon these squares 
 Not even the wise owl could put them there 
 So strange these snow white leaves 
 His father shielding his concern resenting the knowledge Sequoia yearned 
 Crumbled the snow white leaves 
 He said when I explain then it's done these are talking leaves my son 
 The white men's talking leaves 
 The white man takes a berry of black and red 
 And an eagle's feather from the eagle's bed 
 And he makes bird track marks 
 And the marks on the leaves they say carry messages to his brother far away 
 And his brother knows what's in his heart 
 They see these marks and they understand the truth in the heart of the far off man 
 The enemies can't hear them 
 Said Sequoia's father son they weave bad medicine on these talking leaves 
 Leave such things to them 
 Then Sequoia walking lightly followed his father quietly but so amazed was he 
 If the white man talks on leaves why not the Cherokee 
 Vanished from his father's face Sequoia went from place to place 
 But he could not forget 
 Year after year he worked on and on till finally he cut into stone 
 The Cherokee alphabet 
 Sequoia's hair by now was white his eyes began to lose their light 
 But he taught all who would believe 
 That the Indian's thoughts could be written down 
 Just as the white men's there on the ground and he left us these talking leaves
 
 Moses led God's children out to find the promised land
 And on the way he'd stop each day and look to Heaven and
 Asked God for help as he could not withstand the task alone
 And then one day he looked away and thereby lay a stone
 God said write upon this stone these words I say to you
 And if you all obey my rules I'll see you safely through
 God opened Heaven's door and then He guided Moses' hands
 And then He said go and tell my children these are my commands
 Go and climb that mountain Moses climb that mountain now and pray
 Climb that mountain now and tell us what our Lord has had to say
 Thou shalt have no Gods before me is my great command
 And thou shalt not make any graven image by thy hand
 Thou shalt not take my name in vain if thou would guiltless be
 Remember thou to keep the sabbath day alone for me
 Honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt not kill
 Thou shalt not commit adult'ry and thou shalt not steal
 Love thy neighbor as thyself and show thy neighbor peace
 Covet not thy neighbor's house nor anything that's his
 Go and climb that mountain...
 Moses showed these words of God to all the children then
 They pulled up stakes and headed out to find the promised land
 That Moses had described to them and told of comforts there
 The children of oppression thought they'd not find anywhere
 But they were soon to part from him and push alone awhile
 For it was never meant for him to walk that final mile
 The children cried if we must go on Moses without you
 Then talk to God just one more time and tell us what to do
 Go and climb that mountain...
 Thou shalt have no Gods before me...
 
 Many many years ago when this land was young
 A lot of our country was covered by big tall beautiful trees
 And men had to have the trees to make wood to build houses
 Make furniture with to make boots even to make paper with
 So as more and more people came more wood was needed
 And more and more trees were cut down
 And the man that lived in the forest and cut down the trees
 Was called the Timber man
 
 Well my world is green and dark and dumb my home is in the loggin' camp
 All week I cut down the mighty trees Saturday I get to do as I please
 I give the man more than his hire and he'll never know it if I tire
 Show me the toughest tree around the Timber man will bring it down
 Swing it hard cut it clean no halfway or in-between
 Move when the axe is in my hand make way for the Timber man
 
 Yeah he was a mighty big tough man usually
 That Timber man that lived in that forest and cut down those big trees
 Well they say there's sawdust in my brain and don't get caught out in the rain
 I got stump water in my blood the sweat from my brow turns the ground to mud
 When the men don't know how to fell a tree the one they'll come and ask is me
 I'll mark my spot and I'll take my stand the tree's gonna fall for the Timber man
 Swing it hard cut it clean
 
 And when they're cuttin' on a tree and it's just about ready to fall
 The man yells out timeber timber
 
 The troubadour the troubadour sings from his heart
 The song that's the hit of the show
 Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar 
 Alone in the bright spotlight's glow
 The song was for someone he loved so true
 Who loved him then left him for someone new
 The troubaour the troubadour smile as he sings
 But his heart is breaking in two
 
 They beg for more the troubadour sings once again
 The song that's the hit of the show
 Watch him sing and play the strings of his guitar 
 Alone in the bright spotlight's glow
 There is a hush in the darkened hall 
 A few hearts are heavy and teardrops fall
 But in the crowd one head is bowed for the troubadour
 And oh her heart aches most of all
 Troubadour troubadour her heart aches most of all
 
 Troubadour
 
 Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou 
 Oh wagon trains rollin' along they fade from my visions and in time will be gone 
 I see an eagle in space my people will follow oh oh a vanishing race 
 Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou 
 
 An Indian brave rolled along one day on a lonely mountain trail 
 And he gazed below with a heart of woe where the prairie schooners sail 
 A vision formed like a mortal storm in the dust of the wagon train 
 A vanishing race appeared in space and he sang his sad refrain 
 
 Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou 
 Oh wagon trains rollin' along... 
 Oh now great spirits on high please spare them the sorrow you show to my eye oh oh 
 Now my blankets are roll and I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh 
 
 Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou 
 And I ride to the valley of the brave Navajo oh oh 
 Oh oh a vanishing Navajo oh the vanishing Navajo 
 Ii Ii ou Ii Ii Ii ou Ii Ii ou
 
 From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
 She climbs a flowery mountains o'er the hills and by the shore
 She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
 She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball
 
 Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
 As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
 Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
 Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
 
 Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
 As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
 She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
 She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball
 
 Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
 And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
 His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
 We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball
 
 There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
 But the strangest of them all
 Was a friend of mine who spent his time
 Staring at the wall
 Staring at the wall
 
 As he looked at the wall
 So strong and tall
 You could hear him softly curse
 Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
 But I'm gonna be the first
 I'm gonna be the first
 
 Well the warden walked by and said son don't try
 I'd hate to see you fall
 For there is no doubt they'll carry you out
 If you ever touch that wall
 If you ever touch that wall
 
 Well a years went by since .....that's the truth
 Well a years gone 
 Well a years gone by since he made his try
 But I can still recall
 How hard he tried and the way he died
 But he never made that wall
 Never made that wall
 
 Well there's never been a man ever shook this can
 But I knew a man who tried
 The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
 But I know it was suicide
 I know it was suicide
 
 There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
 But the strangest of them all
 Was a friend of mine who spent his time staring at the wall
 Staring at the wall
 
 As he stared at that wall so strong and tall
 You could hear him softly curse nobody at all
 Ever climbed that wall but I'm gona be the first
 Yeah I'm gonna be the first
 
 The warden walked by and said son don't try
 I'd hate to see you fall
 For there is no doubt they'll carry you out
 If you ever touch that wall
 If you ever touch that wall

 But I can still recall
 How hard he tried and the way he died
 But he never made that wall
 He never made that wall
 
 There's never been a man ever shook this can

 The newspapers called it a jail break plan
 But I know it was suicide
 I know it was suicide
 
 I went out walking
 Through streets paved with gold
 Lifted some stones
 Saw the skin and bones
 Of a city without a soul
 I went out walking
 Under an atomic sky
 Where the ground won't turn
 And the rain it burns
 Like the tears when I said goodbye
 
 Yeah I went with nothing
 Nothing but the thought of you
 I went wandering
 
 I went drifting
 Through the capitals of tin
 Where men can't walk
 Or freely talk
 And sons turn their fathers in
 I stopped outside a church house
 Where the citizens like to sit
 They say they want the kingdom
 But they don't want God in it
 
 I went out riding
 Down that old eight lane
 I passed by a thousand signs
 Looking for my own name
 
 I went with nothing
 But the thought you'd be there too
 Looking for you
 
 I went out there
 In search of experience
 To taste and to touch
 And to feel as much
 As a man can
 Before he repents
 
 I went out searching
 Looking for one good man
 A spirit who would not bend or break
 Who would sit at his father's right hand
 I went out walking
 With a bible and a gun
 The word of God lay heavy on my heart
 I was sure I was the one
 Now Jesus, don't you wait up
 Jesus, I'll be home soon
 Yeah I went out for the papers
 Told her I'd be back by noon
 
 Yeah I left with nothing
 But the thought you'd be there too
 Looking for you
 
 Yeah I left with nothing
 Nothing but the thought of you
 I went wandering
 
 Oh ho
 
 I saw a way worn traveler in tattered garments clad 
 And struggling up the mountain, it seemed that he was sad 
 His back was laden heavy, his strength was almost gone 
 But he shouted as he journeyed, ''Deliverance will come" 
 Then palms of victory, crowns of glory 
 Palms of victory I shall wear 
 Yes, palms of victory, crowns of glory 
 Palms of victory I shall wear 
 
 The summer sun was shining, the sweat was on his brow 
 His garments torn and dusty, his step seemed very slow 
 But he kept pressing onward, for he was wending home 
 Still shouting as he journeyed, "Deliverance will come" 
 Then palms of victory, crowns of glory 
 Palms of victory I shall wear 
 Yes, palms of victory, crowns of glory 
 Palms of victory I shall wear 
 
 You've cut out your dancing,
 And you never see a show;
 Friends drop by to pick you up,
 And you hardly ever go;
 It seems your head is in the clouds above.
 You've got the ways of a woman in love.
 
 I walk by your house at night
 In hope that I might see
 The guy who's got you in a spin;
 I wish that guy was me!
 I don't know why it's you I'm dreaming of.
 You've got the ways of a woman in love.
 
 Many is the night
 I've stayed awake and cried;
 Now you'll never know how much
 You've hurt my foolish pride.
 
 I recall your kisses,
 The times I held you tight;
 Now when I come to see you,
 You're sitting in the light,
 Missing all the things that we dreamed of.
 You've got the ways of a woman in love.
 
 Many is the night
 I've stayed awake and cried;
 Now you'll never know how much
 You've hurt my foolish pride.
 
 I recall your kisses,
 The times I held you tight;

 You're sitting in the light,

 You've got the ways of a woman in love.
 
 It took a mighty good man with salty hands
 And a mighty long raft to keep the fore before the act
 You take ten good men and guts and luck
 And you might navigate the whirl and the suck
 
 Well, the Tennessee River changed its mind
 At Chattanooga she oughta unwind
 She could a run right on the Georgia Sea
 But she cut right back through Tennessee
 
 Well, the settlers come by raft
 And boat bringin' everything that could stay a float
 But like a loco horse that'll twist and buck
 They hardly ever made it through the whirl and the suck
 
 It took a mighty good man with salty hands
 And a mighty long raft to keep the fore before the act
 You take ten good men and guts and luck
 And you might navigate the whirl and the suck
 
 When General Washington was in his knicker bocks
 The Cherokee Indians through the Chattanooga Rocks
 And the Chickamagua tribe and the Nickajack
 They kept the watch where the river cut back
 And if a raft or a boat ever rode the bend
 The Indians got 'em cause they had 'em hemmed in
 
 It took a mighty good man with salty hands
 And a mighty long raft to keep the fore before the act
 You take ten good men and guts and luck
 And you might navigate the whirl and the suck
 
 Oh, give to me a winding stream, it must not be too wide 
 Where waving leaves from maple trees meet from either side 
 The water must be deep enough to float our small canoe 
 With no one else but you 
 Oh do not disturb my waking dream, 
 and the splendor of my winding stream 
 Flower in my canoe, her eyes, they looked me through 
 My maiden fair with golden hair is very much like you 
 
 The sparkling trout beneath the bank doth leave his hiding place 
 Kingfisher there from the bough above so eager to give chase 
 The spreading branches overhead, the sunrise peeping through 
 When looking down at you 
 Oh do not disturb my waking dream, 
 and the splendor of that winding stream 
 Oh flower in my canoe, her eyes, they looked me through 
 A maiden fair with golden hair is very much like you 
 A maiden fair with golden hair is very much like you 
 
 I've been living a new way
 Of life that I love so
 But I can see the clouds are gathering
 And the storm will wreck our home
 
 For last night he held you tightly
 And you didn't even shove
 This is true for I've been watching
 From the window up above
 
 You must have thought that I was sleeping
 And I wish that I had been
 But it's best to know you
 And the way your heart can sin
 
 I thought we belong together
 And our hearts fit like a glove
 I was wrong for I've been watching
 From the window up above
 
 From my eyes the teardrops started
 As I listened on and on
 Heard you whisper to him softly
 That our marriage was all wrong
 
 But I hope he makes you happy
 And you will never loose his love
 I was wrong I was watching
 From the window up above
 
 How I wish I could be dreaming
 And wake up to an honest love 
 I was wrong for I was watching
 From the window up above
 
 Bet it ain't raining back home,
 Bet you sister's still on the phone,
 Bet momma's in the kitchen cooking fried chicken,
 Wishing that I hadn't done wrong. 
 
 Momma, don't you worry about it none though,
 Everything's gonna be alright, momma,
 They're teaching us a lot of new things in here, momma,
 Things like there ain't no good in an evil hearted woman,
 
 And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James,
 And you don't go writing hot checks down in Mississippi,
 And there ain't no good chain gang. 
 Papa's reading yesterday's mail,
 
 Wishing that the hay was all bailed,
 I bet he's wishing he could go fishing,
 And here I am a'lazing in jail.
 Well, papa, don't you worry about it none,
 
 Now, everything's gonna be alright, papa,
 They're teaching us a lesson today, 
 We're learning pretty well too,
 We've already learned a whole lot of stuff already,
 
 Things like there ain't no good in an evil hearted woman,
 And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James,
 And you don't go writing hot checks down in Mississippi,
 And there ain't no good chain gang. There ain't no good in an evil hearted woman,
 
 And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James,
 And you don't go writing hot checks down in Mississippi,
 And there ain't no good chain gang. 
 There ain't no good in an evil hearted woman,
 
 And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James,
 And you don't go writing hot checks down in Mississippi,
 And there ain't no good chain gang. There ain't no good in an evil hearted woman,
 And I ain't cut out to be no Jesse James,
 
 And you don't go writing hot checks down in Mississippi,
 And there ain't no good chain gang.
 
 You're gonna break another heart
 You're gonna tell another lie
 
 Well, here I am and there you go, you're gone again
 I know you're gonna be the way you've always been
 
 Breaking hearts and telling lies is all you know
 Another guy gives you the eye
 There you go
 
 There you go
 You're gone again
 I should've known
 I couldn't win 
 
 There you go
 You're by his side
 You're gonna break another heart
 You're gonna tell another lie
 
 Because I love you so, I take much more than I should take
 I want you even though I know my heart is going to break
 
 You build me up and for a while I'm all aglow
 Then your fickle heart sees someone else
 There you go
 
 There you go
 You're gone again
 I should've known
 I couldn't win 
 
 There you go
 You're by his side
 You're gonna break another heart
 You're gonna tell another lie
 
 "So, you're going to leave the old home, Jim 
 Today you're going away 
 So, you're going among the city folks to dwell" 
 So spoke a kind old mother 
 To her boy one summer day 
 "If your mind's made up that way, I wish you well 
 The old home will be lonesome 
 We'll miss you when you go 
 The birds won't sing so sweet when you're not nigh 
 But if you get in trouble, Jim Just write and let us know" 
 She spoke these words and then she said goodbye 
 
 If sickness overtakes you 
 Or old companions shake you 
 As through this world you wander all alone 
 When friends you haven't any 
 In your pocket not a penny 
 There's a mother always awaiting you at home 
 
 Ten years later to this village 
 Came a stranger no one knew 
 His steps were halt and ragged clothes he wore 
 The little children laughed at him 
 As down the lane he trod 
 At last he stopped before a cottage door 
 He gently knocked, no sound he heard 
 He thought, "Can she be dead?" 
 But then he heard a voice well known to him 
 Was his mother's voice, but her hair had silvered 
 By the touch of time 
 And she said, "Thank God, they've sent me home my Jim" 
 
 If sickness overtakes you Or old companions shake you 
 As through this world you wander all alone 
 When friends you haven't any In your pocket not a penny 
 There's a mother always awaiting you at home 
 
 
 These are my people
 This is a land where my forefathers lie
 These are my people
 In brotherhood, we're heirs of a creed to live by
 A creed that proclaims that by loved one's blood stains
 This is my land and these are my people
 
 These are my people
 They were born on and lived by the land
 These are my people
 And their cities were raised by hardworking hands
 And their faces do tell that they're holding on well
 To this, their land
 Yes, these are my people
 
 These are my people
 These are the ones who will reach for the stars
 These are my people
 By the light of the Earth, you can tell they are ours
 A new step to take and a new day will break
 For this, my land
 Yes these are my people
 
 These are my people
 Hmm
 
 These hands aren't the hands of a gentleman these hands are calloused and old 
 These hands raised a family these hands built a home 
 Now these hands raised to praise the Lord 
 
 These hands won the heart of my loved one and with hers they were never alone 
 If these hands filled their task then what more could you ask 
 For these fingers have worked to the bone 
 
 Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like me be 
 For my life hasn't been a success 
 Some people have power but still they grieve 
 While these hands brought me happiness 
 
 Now I'm tired and I'm old and I haven't much gold 
 Maybe things ain't been all that I planned 
 Lord above hear my plea when it's time to judge me 
 Take a look at these hard working hands take a look at these hard working hands
 
 These things shall pass and some great morning 
 We'll look back and smile at heartaches we have known 
 So don't forget when shadows gather 
 The Lord our God is still the King upon his throne 
 A rose looks grey at midnight but the flame is just asleep 
 And steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white heat 
 These things shall pass and life be sweeter 
 When love and faith are strong they cannot long endure 
 These things shall pass so don't you worry 
 The darkest time is just one hour before dawn 
 So hold up high and face your troubles 
 And don't despair if you must face them all alone 
 A rose looks grey at midnight... 
 
 Bad luck wind been blowin' at my back
 I was born to bring trouble to wherever I'm at
 Got the number thirteen tattooed on my neck
 When the ink starts to itch 
 Then the black will turn to red
 
 I was born in the soul of misery
 Never had me a name
 They just gave me the number 
 When I was young
 
 Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well
 The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell
 Bad luck wind been blowin' at my back
 I pray you don't look at me 
 I pray I don't look back
 
 I was born in the soul of misery
 Never had me a name
 They just gave me the number 
 When I was young
 
 I was born in the soul of misery
 Never had me a name
 They just gave me the number 
 When I was young
 
 They just gave me the number 
 When I was young
 
 I ain't a gonna need this house no longer ain't a gonna need this house no more
 Ain't got time to fix the shingles ain't got time to fix the door
 Ain't got time to oil the hinges nor to mingle the window panes
 I ain't gonna need this house no longer I'm gettin' ready to meet the saints
 This ole house once I knew my children this house once I knew my wife
 This ole house was joy and comfort as we fought the storms of life
 This ole house once rang with laughter this ole house heard many a shouts
 Now she trembles in the darkness oh when the lightnin' walks about
 I ain't a gonna need this house no longer...
 
 Now my old hound dog lies a sleepin' he don't know I'm gonna leave
 Else he'd wake up by the fireplace and he'd sit there and gowl and grieve
 But my huntin' days are over ain't gonna hunt the coon no more
 Gabriel done brought in my chariot when the wind blew down the door
 I ain't a gonna need this house no longer...
 
 We're gonna ride the Bible train now
 No some won't ride, but we're going get on the Bible train
 Some ride but not all the way
 The Bible train is in the yard now and it's waiting and oh it looks so good
 But you might get bored and impatient waiting like those two good brothers over there
 They pass around the bottle in the car before they got on the train
 Just want to take one more for the road and then, that leads to something else
 Well they ain't on the train no more and maybe 9 or 10 got off with them
 There's a sister in the church and she says to her friend 
 Your husband works at night and so does mine, why don't we just
 
 Get together sometime when they're gone and go downtown and find us some action, 
 Well then they gotta get off the Bible train.
 
 And then another man he's sitting over there looking at a woman in the corner 
 And he's gives her that eye, you know and they
 
 Meet later, secretly, so they got to get off, 
 This train's got a rule against adultery.
 
 And while all this is happening the train is getting ready to go, 
 But there's a lot more to get off than different reasons
 
 Just before the train pulls out, 
 But listen its starting to move now, 
 Listen to it.
 
 Here we go'.
 
 As it leaves the man on the caboose with a long white beard says,
 This train is bound for gory, this train,
 This train is bound for glory, this train,
 This train is bound for glory nobody rides it but the righteous and holy,
 This train is bound for glory, this train
 
 This train is a free train, this train,
 This train is a free train, this train,
 This train is a free train,
 Everybody rides in Jesus' name
 This train is a free train, this train,
 
 This train it don't pull no liars, this train
 This train don't pull no liars, this train
 This train don't pull no liars,
 No false pretenders and no backbiters
 This train don't pull no liars, this train.
 
 This train is a clean train, this train
 This train is a clean train, this train
 This train is a clean train,
 Everybody rides it in Jesus' name
 This train is a clean train, this train
 
 Do you want to ride it children, this holy train'
 Do you want to ride it children, this righteous train'
 
 Get on board
 Get on board
 Get on board
 Get on board this holy train
 Get on board
 Get on board
 Get on board this holy train
 
 
 Time has passed I've forgotten mother nature does wonderful things 
 I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything 
 You can change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing 
 I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything 
 
 Goodbye good luck may God bless you I don't say I won't love again 
 I guess that it's true for me and for you that time changes everything
 
 It was the time of the preacher
 When the story began
 Of the choice of a lady
 And the love of a man
 
 And how he loved her so dearly
 He went out of his mind
 When she left him for someone
 She'd left behind
 
 He cried like a baby
 He screamed like a panther
 In the middle of the night
 And he saddled his pony
 And he went for a ride
 
 It was the time of the preacher
 In the year of '01
 Now the preaching is over
 And the lesson's begun
 
 But he could not forgive her
 Though he tried and he tried and he tried
 And the halls of his memory
 Still echo her lies
 
 He cried like a baby
 He screamed like a panther
 In the middle of the night
 And he saddled his pony
 And he went for a ride
 
 It was the time of the preacher
 In the year of '01
 Now the lesson is over
 And the killing's begun
 
 It was the time of the preacher
 In the year of '01
 When you think it's all over
 It's only begun
 
 And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped show me how to beat the devil.
 
 It was winter time in Nashville, down on music city row.
 And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold.
 To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul.
 Keep the chilly wind off my guitar.
 
 My thirsty wanted whisky; my hungry needed beans,
 But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream.
 So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams,
 I left my pride and stepped inside a bar.
 
 Actually, I guess you'd could call it a Tavern:
 Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor;
 Friendly shadows.
 
 I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar.
 And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar.
 An' he turned and said: "Come up here boy, and show us what you are."
 I said: "I'm dry." He bought me a beer.
 
 He nodded at my guitar and said: "It's a tough life, ain't it?"
 I just looked at him. He said: "You ain't makin' any money, are you?"
 I said: "You've been readin' my mail."
 He just smiled and said: "Let me see that guitar.
 "I've got something you oughta hear."
 Then he laid it on me:
 
 "If you waste your time a-talkin' to the people who don't listen,
 "To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear.
 "And if you should die explainin' how the things that they complain about,
 "Are things they could be changin', who do you think's gonna care?"
 
 There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind,
 Who were crucified for what they tried to show.
 And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time.
 'Cause the truth remains that no-one wants to know.
 
 Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before,
 Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door.
 When no-one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor,
 And lonesome was more than a state of mind.
 
 You see, the devil haunts a hungry man,
 If you don't wanna join him, you got to beat him.
 I ain't sayin' I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing.
 Then I stole his song.
 
 And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen,
 To the things that I am sayin', prayin' someone's gonna hear.
 And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about,
 Are things they could be changin', hopin' someone's gonna care.
 
 I was born a lonely singer, and I'm bound to die the same,
 But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul.
 And if I never have a nickle, I won't ever die ashamed.
 'Cause I don't believe that no-one wants to know.
 
 Yes, went they through the Lehigh Valley
 To Lake Erie past Virginia
 And the land called out its challenge
 Bring your men to match our mountains
 See the green Ohio Valley
 See the Cumberland, the Wabash
 
 On the Tennessee they floated
 On great rafts to the Mississippi
 And the Cherokee and Shawnee
 And the Creek and The Ojibwa
 And the Choctaw and the Quapaw
 And all the tribes along the rivers
 
  that they were coming
 That the white man was upon them
 They built their homes along the rivers
 Built their churches, brought their preachers
 Came upon the white misery
 Stopped before the shining mountains
 
 Many died from the beginning
 For the freedom of America
 Like that day down in New Orleans
 
 So you're feeling numb about me being gone
 So you see now you're half alive when you're alone
 Well I just hope the pain will ease a little as you wait
 You gave me love but too little too late
 
 Dark days're coming now you see
 Hard times for you as well as me
 All time load is coming under your front gate
 You gave me love but too little too late
 
 So you got plans about some fine affair
 Well think about it a little while while you're lying there
 Love long and hard and don't make your lover wait
 You gave me love but too little too late
 
 Dark days're coming now you see
 Hard times for you as well as me
 All time load is coming under your front gate
 You gave me love but too little too late
 
 You gave me love but too little too late
 
 Honey, I love you too much
 Need your lovin' too much
 Want the thrill of your touch
 Gee, I can't hold you too much
 You do all the livin'
 While I do all the givin'
 'Cause I love you too much
 
 You spend all my money too much
 Have to share you honey, too much
 When I want some lovin', you're gone
 Don't you know you're treatin' me wrong
 Now you got me started
 Don't you leave me broken hearted
 'Cause I love you too much
 
 Every time I kiss your sweet lips
 I can feel my heart go flip flip
 I'm such a fool for your charms
 Like to hear you sighin'
 Even though I know you're lyin'
 'Cause I love you too much
 
 Need your lovin' all the time
 Need you huggin', please be mine
 Need you near me, stay real close
 Please, please, hear me, you're the most
 Now you got me started
 Don't you leave me broken hearted
 'Cause I love you too much
 
 Train of love's a coming big black wheels a humming
 People waiting at the station happy hearts a drumming
 Trainman tell me maybe ain't you got my baby
 Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
 But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
 
 Now stop your whistle blowing 'cause I've got ways of knowing
 Your bringing other people's lovers but my own keeps going
 Train of love this evening when she's not gone she's leaving
 Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
 But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
 
 Train of love now hasting sweet hearts standing waiting
 Here and there and everywhere there gonna be embracing
 Trainman tell me maybe ain't you got my baby
 Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
 But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
 
 Train of loves a leaving, leaving my heart grieving
 But early and late I'll set and wait because I'm still believing
 We'll walk away together though' I may wait forever
 Ever so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
 But everybody's baby but mine's coming home
 
 Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds 
 Took a transfusion and I shot my woman down 
 Went right home and I went to bed I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head 
 Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun took a transfusion and away I run 
 Made a good run but I run too slow they overtook me down in Juarez Mexico 
 Late in the hot joints takin' the pills in walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill 
 He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown 
 You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down 
 Said yes oh yes my name is Willy Lee 
 If you've got a warrant just a read it to me 
 Shot her down because she made me slow 
 I thought I was her daddy but she had five more 
 When I was arrested I was dressed in black put me on a train and they took me back 
 Had no friends for to go my bail they slapped my dried up carcass in that country jail 
 Into the courtroom my trial began where I was handled by twelve honest men 
 Just before the jury started out I saw the little judge commenced to look about 
 In about five minutes in walked the man holding the verdict in his right hand 
 Verdict read in the first degree I hollered Lowdy Lowdy have a mercy on me 
 The judge he smiled as he picked up his ben 99 years in the San Quentin pen 
 99 years underneath that ground I can't forget the day I shot my woman down 
 Come on you guys and listen unto me lay off that liquor and let that transfusion be
 
 Trouble in mind, I'm blue
 But I won't be blue always
 'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
 
 I'm going down to the river
 I'm going top take me a rocking chair
 And if the blues don't leave me, I rock on away from here
 
 Trouble in mind, I'm blue
 But I won't be blue always
 'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
 
 Trouble in mind, that's true
 I have almost lost my mind
 Life ain't worth living, I feel like I could die
 
 Trouble in mind, I'm blue
 My poor heart is healing slow
 I've never had such trouble in my whole life before
 
 I'm gonna lay my head on some lonesome railroad line
 And let that two-nineteen special ease my troubled mind
 
 Trouble in mind, I'm blue
 But I won't be blue always
 'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
 
 Troublesome waters much blacker than night 
 Are hiding from view of the harbor's bright lights 
 Tossed in the turmoil of life's stormy sea I cry to my Saviour have mercy on me 
 Then gently I'm feeling the touch of his hands guiding my boat in safely to land 
 Leading the way to heaven's bright shore 
 Troublesome waters I'm fearing no more 
  
 Troublesome waters around me do roll they're rocking my boat and racking my soul 
 Loved ones are drifting and living in sin the treacherous whirlpools are pulling them in 
 Then gently I'm feeling... 
  
 When troublesome waters are rolling so high I'll lift up my voice and to heaven I'll cry 
 My Lord I am trusting give guidance to me and steady my boat on life's troubled sea 
 Then gently I'm feeling...
 
 I woke up this mornin' in a terrible mood
 Now you talk about a woman treatin' a good man rude
 She had me talkin' to myself gazin' at that mean ol' wall
 She had another daddy waitin' down at the end of the hall
 
 She changes with the weather like the leaves I recall
 She blossoms in the spring but then she's gone in the fall
 A two timin' woman with a heart of solid stone
 She tells me that she loves me but her heart's a little under grown
 
 Well, she said she'd never leave me but she got the urge to roam
 She drifts around the country like a steamboat on a foam
 She never changes course, she just goes along that same ol' way
 And I hope she keeps a driftin' rolls along back home someday
 
 'Cause if I ever find her, gonna chain her to the floor
 And tell her, "Now sit there, woman, you ain't leavin' no more
 I'm gonna tame your mama till you're eatin' from my hand
 It's not that I don't love you, honey, it's just to make you understand"
 
 Yes, I woke up this mornin' in a terrible mood
 You talk about a woman treatin' a good man rude
 She had me talkin' to myself gazin' at that mean ol' wall
 She had another daddy waitin' down at the end of the hall
 
 I have been ungrateful
 I have been unwise
 Restless from the cradle
 But now I realize
 It's so hard to see the rainbow
 Through glasses dark as these
 Maybe I'll be able
 From down on my knees
 
 Oh, I am weak
 Oh, I know I am vain
 Take this weight from me
 Let my spirit be unchained
 
 Old man swearin' at the sidewalk
 I'm overcome
 Seems that we've both forgotten
 Forgotten to go home
 
 Oh, have I seen an angel
 Or have I seen a ghost
 Where's that rock of ages
 When I need it most
 
 Oh, I am weak
 Oh, I know I am vain
 Take this weight from me
 Let my spirit be unchained
 
 Oh my love, my darling 
 I've hungered for your touch 
 A long lonely time
 Time goes by so slowly 
 And time can do so much 
 Are you still mine
 I need your love 
 I need your love 
 God speed your love to me
 Lonely rivers flow 
 To the sea 
 To the sea 
 To the open arms of the sea
 Lonely riverside 
 Wait for me 
 Wait for me 
 I'll be coming home 
 Wait for me
 
 Time goes by so slowly 
 And time can do so much 
 Are you still mine
 I need your love 
 I need your love 
 God speed your love to me
 God speed your love to me
 
 Don't call my name out your window, I'm leavin'
 I won't even turn my head.
 Don't sent your kinfolk to give me no talkin'
 I'll be gone, like I said.
 
 You'd just say the same old thing
 That you be sayin' all along,
 Just lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut,
 Till I'm gone.
 Don't give me that old familiar cry and fuss and moan
 
 Understand your man, I'm tired of your bad-mouthin'
 Understand your man.
 
 You can give my other suit to the Salvation Army,
 And everything else I leave behind
 I ain't takin' nothin' that'll slow down my travelin'
 While I'm untanglin' my mind.
 
 I ain't gonna repeat
 What I said any more
 While I'm breathin' air that ain't been breathed before,
 I'll be just as gone as the wild goose in winter
 
 Then you'll understand your man, meditate on it
 Understand your man, you hear me talking
 Understand your man. Remember what I told you
 Understand your man
 Understand your man
 
 Here's a song called Virgie 
 That I wrote for aunt Virgie Haughs 
 And I dedicate it to her husband, to her children 
 And the countless people that loved her so much 
 
 Virgie, your house was always warm 
 And my bed was always ready when I came 
 Virgie, in the middle of the night 
 You would welcome friends of mine without a name 
 And you could always hear and see, the turning of the key 
 And your laughing voice to me was like a song 
 
 Virgie, your spirit sweet and free Is living still with me though you are gone 
 Virgie, you spoke softly and kind 
 And you'd never say a word to criticize 
 Virgie, your children love you so 
 More than we ever let you realize 
 And day or night I knew that I could bring my cares to you 
 And when I was wrong, you'd never put me down 
 Virgie, there's so much I could say 
 But I can't find the way to write it down 
 Can't find the way to write it down 
 
 Oh, those Wabash Blues
 I know I got my dues
 A lonesome soul am I
 I feel that I could die
 
 Candle light that gleams
 Taunts me in my dreams
 I'll pack my walking shoes
 To lose those Wabash Blues
 
 All around the water tank waitin' for a train
 A thousand miles away from home sleeping in the rain
 I walked up to a brakeman just to give him a line of talk
 
 He said if you've got money I'll see that you don't walk
 Well I haven't got a nickel not a penny can I show
 He said get off you railroad bum and he slammed the boxcar door
 
 Well he put me off in Texas a place I dearly love
 The wide open spaces all around me the moon and stars above
 Nobody seems to want me nor to lend me a helping hand
 
 I'm on my way from Frisco headin' back to Dixie Land
 My pocketbook is empty my heart is willed with pain
 I'm a thousand miles away from home just waitin' for a train
 
 Last week, uh, in Nashville, Bob Dylan, one of the top writers
 Well, I don't need to tell you who Bob Dylan is
 The greatest writer of our time was at our house, and
 He and I sat down and wrote a song together
 Let me see if I can find that damn thing, I'll sing it for you
 Yeah, here it is. It's called Wanted Man
 Do you know the introduction Bob? OK
 
 Wanted man in California,
 Wanted man in Buffalo
 Wanted man in Kansas City,
 Wanted man in Ohio
 
 Wanted man in Mississippi,
 Wanted man in ol' Cheyenne
 
 Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man
 
 I might be in Colorado,
 Or Georgia by the sea
 Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
 
 If you ever see me coming and if you know who I am
 Don't you breathe it to nobody 'cause you know I'm on the lamb
 
 Wanted man by Lucy Watson,
 Wanted man by Jeannie Brown
 Wanted man by Nellie Johnson,
 Wanted man in this next town
 
 I've had all that I wanted of a lot of things I've had
 And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad
 
 I got sidetracked in El Paso,
 Stopped to get myself a map
 Went the wrong way in Pleura with Juanita on my lap
 
 And I went to sleep in Shreveport,
 Woke up in Abilene
 Wonderin' why the hell I'm wanted at some town half way in between
 
 Wanted man in Albuquerque,
 Wanted man in Syracuse
 Wanted man in Tallahassee,
 Wanted man in Baton Rouge
 
 There's somebody set to grab me
 Anywhere that I might be
 And wherever you might look tonight
 You might get a glimpse of me
 
 Wanted man in California,
 Wanted man in Buffalo
 Wanted man in Kansas City,
 Wanted man in Ohio
 
 Wanted man in Mississippi,
 Wanted man in ol' Cheyenne
 
 Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man
 
 
 I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
 Traveling through this world below
 There is no sickness, no toil, nor danger
 In that bright land to which I go
 
 I'm going there to see my Father
 And all my loved ones who've gone on
 I'm just going over Jordan
 I'm just going over home
 
 I know dark clouds will gather 'round me
 I know my way is hard and steep
 But beauteous fields arise before me
 Where God's redeemed, their vigils keep
 I'm going there to see my Mother
 She said she'd meet me when I come
 
 So, I'm just going over Jordan
 I'm just going over home
 I'm just going over Jordan
 I'm just going over home
 
 Class of 55 
 Early one morning it was drizzling rain round the curve came the Memphis train 
 Heard somebody holler, and a million more, the King is dead, but Lord he still ain't gone 
 But he still ain't gone, but he still ain't gone  
 
 If you want to get to heaven, gotta D-I-E. You got to put on your coat and your T-I-E 
 If you want to catch a rabbit in an L-O-G, You gotta make a commotion like a D-O-G 
 Like a D-O-G, Like a D-O-G  
 
 Good Lord have mercy, what's the matter with me? what makes me want to love every woman I see? 
 I'm rating one another, I'm rating again, everyone I see looks like the place I came in 
 Looks like the place I came in  looks like the place I came in  
 
 Lord I got my name printed on my shirt, I ain't no ordinary dude ''cause I don't have to work 
 I just got to town and I'm gone again, but it's a different track, but it's the same old train 
 It's the same old train, it's the same old train (oh god, my god it's the same old train
 
 So here is the stable and there is the manger 
 The new Saviour sleeps on his first earthly night 
 The wise men brought riches but we brought a candle 
 It's all that we have but it gives a good light 
 We are the shepherds we walked cross the mountains 
 We left our flocks when the new star appeard 
 Oh the beautiful singin' of heavenly choir 
 We had to come see him we had to come here 
 We beg you forgive us for such a small offering 
 But our sheep are out there with wolves in the night 
 We bring you this candle it's all we have with us 
 But with it the new Saviour has his first light 
 We are the shepherds... 
 We thank Thee kind Joseph for bidding us enter 
 Please take our gift for the new babe to thine 
 'Tis only one candle but it is our symbol 
 Of how we believe that his great life will shine 
 We are the shepherds...
 
 We oughta be ashamed
 We oughta be ashamed
 We use and abuse such a wonderful name
 
 See the blooming of the flowers
 When the spring first appears
 Hear the crying of the baby
 In its first tender years
 
 Watch the flight of the robin
 When he knows winter's through
 And the One who made that Robin
 Is somewhere watching you
 
 So we oughta be ashamed
 We oughta be ashamed
 We use and abuse such a wonderful name
 Look at the beauty that's all around us
 
 From California to Maine
 Then we think how we mistreat it
 Oh, we oughta be ashamed
 
 Watch the people pass the beggar
 On the street as he cries
 "Pencils for a nickel"
 Still they pass him by
 
 See the rich man with all his money
 Ah, but still he complains
 Smell the flowing of all the whiskey
 Lord, we oughta be ashamed
 
 We oughta be ashamed
 We oughta be ashamed
 We use and abuse such a wonderful name
 And the beauty's all around us
 
 From California to Maine
 Oh, we think how He's mistreated
 We oughta be ashamed
 And think how we mistreat Him
 Lord, we oughta be ashamed
 
 We'll meet again
 Don't know where
 Don't know when
 But I know
 We'll meet again
 Some sunny day
 
 Keep smilin' through
 Just like you
 Always do
 'Til the blue skies drive
 The dark clouds
 Far away
 
 And will you please say hello
 To the folks that I know
 Tell 'em that I won't be long
 And they'll be happy to know
 That as you saw me go
 I was singing this song
 
 We'll meet again
 Don't know where
 Don't know when
 But I know
 We'll meet again
 Some sunny day
 
 Yeah we'll meet again
 I don't know where
 And I don't know when
 But I do know
 That we'll meet again
 Some sunny day
 
 So Honey
 Keep on smilin' through
 Just like you always do
 'Til the blue skies
 Drive the dark clouds
 Far away
 
 And would you please say hello
 To all the folks that I know
 And tell 'em I won't be long
 They'll be happy to know
 That as you saw me go
 I was singing this song
 
 We'll meet again
 Don't know where
 Don't know when
 But I know
 We'll meet again
 Some sunny day
 
 Lord if you should be looking down at little me
 I just like to say I'm trying to stay upon the right track
 But Lord the way gets hard temptation's come and I sure get tired
 But I'm watching for you like you told me to and welcome back
 
 Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus
 I'm watching for your light to shine like you said it would shine when you come
 Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus
 I hope you will see and recognize me and then take me home
 
 Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus
 I'm watching for your light to shine like you said it would shine when you come
 Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus
 I hope you will see and recognize me and then take me home
 
 Welcome back Jesus welcome back Jesus
 
 
 Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
 Oh were you there when they crucified my Lord?
 
 Tremble
 Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
 
 Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
 Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
 
 Tremble
 Were you there when they nailed Him to the cross?
 
 Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
 Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
 
 Tremble
 Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?
 
 Well, were you there when the stone was rolled away?
 Were you there when the stone was rolled away?
 
 Tremble
 Were you there when the stone was rolled away?
 
 I built her a castle of perma stone
 But I should have reigned more with her
 Too often I left my queen alone
 And that was no way to leave her
 
 I rode out in quest of song and wine
 And that was no way to treat her
 I kept her hangin' like grapes on the vine
 And that was no way to keep her
 
 Reds Goodguy rode by on his milk white steed
 And casually mentioned my misdeeds
 He promised her love far greater than mine
 Thus pulled out and plucked my grapes from the vine
 
 I built her a castle with patios
 But I seldom cooked out upon it
 I bought her a TV with stereo
 But I never listened much to it
 
 Now I have a castle but the queen's not home
 And that is no way to have her
 I have the vine but the grapes are gone
 And that's no way to run a vineyard
 
 Reds Goodguy rode by on his milk white steed
 And casually mentioned my misdeeds
 He promised her love far greater than mine
 Thus pulled out and plucked my grapes from the vine
 
 When I'm all through if I haven't been what they think I should be
 If the total isn't high enough when they figure me
 When I grow old if there's no gray from worry in my hair
 What do I care? What do I care?
 
 What do I care just as long as you were mine a little while?
 When the road was long and weary you gave me a few good mile
 What do I care if I miss a goal because I make a slip?
 I'll still be satisfied because I tasted your sweet lips
 
 What do I care if I never have much money?
 And sometimes my table looks a little bare
 Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss
 You love me and I love you, so what do I care?
 
 What do I care just as long as you were mine a little while?
 When the road was long and weary you gave me a few good mile
 What do I care if I miss a goal because I make a slip?
 I'll still be satisfied because I tasted your sweet lips
 
 What do I care if I never have much money?
 And sometimes my table looks a little bare
 Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss
 You love me and I love you, so what do I care?
 
 It all started in 1929 me and Diana had gone to Alaska
 To homestead some of that free government land
 Forty miles from the nearest gravel road we cut our life in the ponderosa pines
 We sweated hard to beat the winter snow
 But the cabin's up and we've got lots of times
 What have you got planned tonight Diana would you consider laying in my arms
 I love you more than ever now Diana I'm sure you're the reason I was born
 
 Jim was born the first year we were here look at him Diana he's almost grown
 And the baby's in the cradle fast asleep just think in no time they'll be up and gone
 What have you got planned
 
 Well time sure does fly by doesn't it Diana
 It's been almost two years now since you've been gone
 Think children grew up so fast
 But I guess they deserve to see the world now don't they
 But you know Diana remembering how you loved me
 And how much I love you I don't feel so alone
 What have you got planned
 What have you got planned
 
 What is man that you are mindful of him Lord
 You made the stars, you made the sun
 And all the worlds that came to be at your command
 What is man? What has he done?
 
 Then you crown him with glory and with honor
 Give him dominion over land and sea and air
 And store up an inheritance in heaven
 Oh what is man that you would care?
 
 What is man that you would let him live at all
 To shed the blood of his own kind
 And ever fail to even follow where you call
 What is man? Why do you mind?
 
 Yet you crown me with glory and with honor
 Give me dominion over land and sea and air
 And store up my inheritance in heaven
 Oh, what is man, that you care?
 What is man, Lord, that you would care?
 
 The old man turned off the radio
 Said, "Where did all of the old songs go
 Kids sure play funny music these days
 They play it in the strangest ways"
 Said, "it looks to me like they've all gone wild
 It was peaceful back when I was a child"
 Well, man, could it be that the girls and boys
 Are trying to be heard above your noise?
 And the lonely voice of youth cries "What is truth?"
 
 A little boy of three sittin' on the floor
 Looks up and says, "Daddy, what is war?"
 "son, that's when people fight and die"
 The little boy of three says "Daddy, why?"
 A young man of seventeen in Sunday school
 Being taught the golden rule
 And by the time another year has gone around
 It may be his turn to lay his life down
 Can you blame the voice of youth for asking 
 "What is truth?"
 
 A young man sittin' on the witness stand
 The man with the book says "Raise your hand"
 "Repeat after me, I solemnly swear"
 The man looked down at his long hair
 And although the young man solemnly swore
 Nobody seems to hear anymore
 And it didn't really matter if the truth was there
 It was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair
 And the lonely voice of youth cries 
 "What is truth?"
 
 The young girl dancing to the latest beat 
 Has found new ways to move her feet
 The young man speaking in the city square
 Is trying to tell somebody that he cares
 Yeah, the ones that you're calling wild
 Are going to be the leaders in a little while
 This old world's wakin' to a new born day
 And I solemnly swear that it'll be their way 
 You better help the voice of youth find 
 "What is truth/"
 
 Will you walk another mile turn a frown with a smile
 Will you live the lowly heart about to break
 Would you also give your cloak to one who took away your coat
 What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
 
 Would you feed the poor in spirit and befriend the persecuted
 Will you show the bounds how all the chains can break
 Did you sow the cropper seed will you walk among the weak
 What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
 
 Did you turn the other cheek are you counted with the meek
 Would you give a little more than you can take
 Will you shine your little light on the children of the night
 What on earth will you do for heaven's sake
 
 Will you feed the poor
 
 When God dips His pen of love in my heart
 And writes my soul a message, He wants me to know
 His Spirit, all divine, fills this sinful soul of mine
 When God Dips His Love In My Heart.
 Well, I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul?
 
 Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be
 But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
 When he reached down his hand for me
 When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me
 I was lost and undone without my God or his son
 When he reached down his hand for me
 
 I was near to despair when he came to me there
 And he showed me that I could be free
 Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete
 When he reached down his hand for me
 When he reached down
 
 The worst that I've ever been hurt in my life
 The first time I ever wanted to die
 Was the night when you told me you loved someone new
 And asked me if I could forget
 
 I'd be like a flower unwanted in spring
 Alone and neglected transplanted in vain
 To a garden of sadness where it's pedals will fall
 In the shadow of undying pain
 
 You can teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
 You may take a pebble and teach it to grow
 You can teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds
 But you can't teach my heart to forget
 
 There are those who are taking vacations to the mountains the lakes and the sea 
 Where they rest from their cares and their troubles 
 What a wonderful time that must be 
 But it seems not my lot to be like them I must toil through the heat and the cold 
 Seekin' out the lost sheep on the mountains bringing wanderers back to the fold 
 But when I take my vacation in heaven what a wonderful time that will be 
 Hearing concerts by the heavenly chorus and the face of my Saviour I'll see 
 Sitting down on the banks of the river neath the shade of the evergreen tree 
 There I'll rest from my burdens forever won't you take your vacation with me 
  
 There I'll rest from my burdens forever won't you take your vacation with me
 
  
 I've met the Master on my knees I was tested I was tried 
 I've seen the God of heaven paint the fields and country side 
 I've been the husband of one wife heard my newborn baby cry 
 But when I've learned enough to really live I'll be old enough to die old enough to die 
 I've always been a hard working man no stopping place have I found 
 But when I'm tired I'm still inspired at night when I lie down 
 I've learned to kinda like this earth some time I wonder why 
 Cause when I've learned enough to really live I'll be old enough to die 
 Old enough to die 
  
 I've always been a hard working man 
 Old enough to die

 I mushed from Port Barrol through a blizzard of snow
 Been out prospecting for two years or so
 Pulled into Fairbanks, the city was a boon
 So I took a little stroll to the Red Dog Saloon
 
 When I walked in the door, the music was clear
 Prettiest voice I had heard in two years
 The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
 When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below
 
 It was red headed Louie that was singing so sweet
 I reached down and took the snow packs off of my feet
 I reached for the gal that was singing the tune
 We did the Eskimo hop all around the saloon
 
 Where the caribou crawl and the grizzly bear hug
 We did our dance on a Kodiak rug
 The song she kept singing would make a man's blood run cold
 When it's springtime in Alaska, it's forty below
 
 Well, I was as innocent as I could be
 I didn't know that Louie was big Ed's wife to be
 He took out his knife and he gave it a throw
 When it's springtime in Alaska, I'll be six feet below
 
 My papa was a hobo when they delivered me 
 We didn't have a doctor cause he couldn't pay the fee 
 But when the goin' got too bad to ease his misery 
 Papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go 
  
 When company would come around he kept the dobro hid 
 He knew he couldn't play the way the other players did 
 Why the guitar's resonator was a gallon bucket lid 
 But papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go 
  
 Well now that papa's gone away it's hanging by the flue 
 The top of it's rusted and the strings're rusty too 
 It won't ever sound the way that it did when it was new 
 When papa played the dobro this a way and he'd go 
 
 When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,
 And the morning breaks, eternal, bright and fair
 When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,
 And the roll is called up yonder, I?ll be there
 
 When the roll, is called up yon-der,
 When the roll, is called up yon-der,
 When the roll, is called up yon-der,
 When the roll is called up yonder I?ll be there
 
 On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise,
 And the glory of His resurrection share
 When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,
 And the roll is called up yonder, I?ll be there
 
 When the roll, is called up yon-der,
 When the roll, is called up yon-der,
 When the roll, is called up yon-der,
 When the roll is called up yonder I?ll be there
 
 Let us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun,
 Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care
 Then when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done,
 And the roll is called up yonder, I?ll be there
 
 When the roll, is called up yon-der,
 When the roll, is called up yon-der,
 When the roll, is called up yon-der,
 When the roll is called up yonder I?ll be there
 
 In the rattle of the battle, came a whisper soft and low
 From a soldier who'd been wounded in the fray
 "I am dying, Captain, dying and I pray before I go
 You will give your promise here I pass away"
 
 Do not ask me dear to linger, for I know not what to say
 When duty calls, just sweetheart's name in vain
 I hope your heart will not be crying, if I'm not among the dying
 I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
 
 Yes, when the roses bloom again, beside the river
 And the Robin Redbreast sings it's sweet refrain
 As in days of Old Lang Syne, I'll be with you sweetheart mine
 I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
 
 Do not ask me dear to linger, for I know not what to say
 When duty calls, just sweetheart's name in vain
 I hope your heart will not be crying if I not among the dying
 I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
 
 When the roses bloom again beside the river
 And the Robin Redbreast sings it's sweet refrain
 As in days of Old Lang Syne, I'll be with you sweetheart mine
 I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
 
 Well when the saints go marchin' in
 Well when the saints go marchin in
 Oh lord i want to be in that number
 When the saints go marchin' in
 
 When the sun refuse to shine
 Well when the sun refuse to shine
 Oh lord i want to be in that number
 When the sun refuse to shine
 
 In a world where everybody's fallin' apart
 One by one, heart by heart
 You and I stay together and we never even try
 Side by side in a world turned upside down
 
 Our love keeps spinnin' around
 And you know it makes me wonder
 As a restaurant for their lives
 Where did we go right?
 Where did we go right?
 
 At a time when all the world is searchin' for truth
 His love for you will even prove
 And what we have is what everybody's tryin' to find
 Peace of mind in a world turned upside down
 
 Our love keeps spinnin' around
 And you know it makes me wonder
 As a restaurant for their lives
 Where did we go right?
 Where did we go right?
 
 So many wrongs, so many lovers
 I wish they all could know
 What we've found in one another
 
 In a world turned upside down
 Our love keep spinnin' around
 And you know it makes me wonder
 As a restaurant for their lives
 Where did we go right?
 Where did we go right?
 Where did we go right?
 
 To Canaan's land, I'm on my way
 Where the soul  never dies
 My darkest night will turn to day
 Where the soul  never dies
 
 No sad farewells
 No tear-dimmed eyes
 Where all is love
 And the soul never dies
 
 Dear friends, there'll be no sad farewells
 There'll be no tear-dimmed eyes
 Where all is peace and joy and love
 And the soul of man never dies
 
 The rose is blooming there for me
 Where the soul  never dies
 And I will spend eternity
 Where the soul  never dies
 
 The love light beams across the foam
 Where the soul  never dies
 It shines and lights the way to home
 Where the soul  never dies
 
 My life will end in deathless sleep
 Where the soul  never dies
 And everlasting joys I'll reap
 Where the soul  never dies
 
 I'm on my way to that fair land
 Where the soul  never dies
 Where there will be no parting hand
 Where the soul  never dies
 
 I have heard of a land on the far away strand
 'Tis a beautiful home of the soul
 Built by Jesus on high, there we never shall die
 'Tis a land where we never grow old
 
 Never grow old, never grow old
 In a land where we'll never grow old
 Never grow old, never grow old
 In a land where we'll never grow old
 
 In that beautiful home where we'll never more roam
 We shall be in the sweet by and by
 Happy praise to the king thru eternity sing
 'Tis a land where we never shall die
 
 When our work here is done and the life crown is won
 And out troubles and trials are o'er
 All our sorrows will end and our voices will blend
 With the loved ones who've gone on before
 
 Layin' 'round home with a ball game on
 Feelin' fairly fine
 Blackberry jam is cookin' in the pan
 And the jam and the cook are mine
 
 I like my honey from the hives of home
 And berries from my old vine
 And I like to get my lovin'
 While I got it on my mind
 
 My dog is asleep at my bare feet
 It's a good day for layin' around
 Just her and me and it's Saturday
 Everybody's gone to town
 
 We've been workin' hard and she gets tired
 That puts me in a bind
 'Coz I like to get my lovin'
 While I got it on my mind
 
 Then she looks at me and I can see
 That old familiar look
 And the jam is sweet as she lowers the heat
 To give it time to cook
 
 Then I lock the door and across the floor
 To my queen of woman kind
 Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
 While I got it on my mind
 
 Now boys don't you be ramble and free
 And leavin' the girls to cry
 'Coz the nights get cold and there ain't no gold
 That'll ever satisfy
 
 And there ain't no joy that'll come to you boys
 Like the kind I've known at times
 When I go right on in that lover
 While I got in on my mind
 
 Yeah, I like to get my lovin'
 While I got in on my mind
 
 I am stunned and I am broken and my head is in my hand
 For she who said she love me will not wed an Indian man
 My Gods who were wild ridden stand quiet by my side
 For although I loved her she would not be my bride
 Oh goodbye softly sweet one it was splended while it ran
 Goodbye my bitter white girl I'll forget you if I can
 She came up to the pueblo with her bright blonde hair
 They told me not to love her but I did not care
 She took me to her parties she carried me around
 And I was a proud one the tallest man in town
 For I found great wonder all wrapped in brilliant dreams
 I held her strong but gentle as kings have held their queens
 I learned to drink strong whiskey as she took me here and there
 Until life without my whiskey I could not bear
 Oh goodbye softly sweet one...
 
 Well when she came to leave me she took me by the arm
 And she said she loved me and would not do me harm
 But she would not marry not an Indian she said
 She thanked me for my offer and I wished that I was dead
 Now I'm back among my people and they are kind to me
 Although I'm sad with staggers when I drink that tough whiskey
 For I've been a white girl's pet a captive Indian
 Shown off and discarded just a drunk who might have been
 Oh goodbye softly sweet one...
 Goodbye softly sweet one...
 
 
 Two times of loneliness and heartbreakin' despair and sadness
 I've always found that a good song of inspiration lift me up
 Makes me feel, just a little bit better
 
 Who, at my door is standing
 Patiently drawing near
 Entrance within, demanding
 Who is the voice, I hear
 
 Sweetly the tones are falling
 Open the door for me
 If Thou wilt heed my calling
 I will abide with Thee
 
 Who, at my door is standing
 Patiently drawing near
 Entrance within, demanding
 Who is the voice, I hear
 
 Sweetly the tones are falling
 Open the door for me
 If Thou wilt heed my calling
 I will abide with Thee
 
 The shepherds afar left their flocks by night 
 Followed the new star by its heavenly light 
 Did the lambs fear the wolves did they lay down and sleep 
 Who kept the sheep who kept the sheep 
 
 Did robbers not steal or did they fear the light 
 That the shepherds had followed night after night 
 Did they not stray did little lambs weep who kept the sheep who kept the sheep 
 Under the new star the new Saviour lay in his dim manger he lay on the hay 
 
 The shepherds that came had a vigil to keep 
 But who kept the sheep who kept the sheep who kept the sheep who kept the sheep
 
 Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
 Back in the saddle again
 
 My little boy said, "Daddy, who's Gene Autry?"
 His old movie was comin' on TV
 And I said, "Let me tell you about him, son"
 And I took him upon my knee
 
 "Why, when I was a little boy about your size
 And just about every Saturday night
 When I could scrape up a dime for the movies
 And when my Daddy said alright"
 
 "I'd be right downtown at the picture show
 Like everybody else that could
 To see a handsome man
 On a big fine stallion goin' about, doin' good"
 
 Singin', "Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
 Put him back in the saddle again
 Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
 Back in the saddle again"
 
 "Well, he could ride his horse and play his guitar
 And sing all at the same time
 And I was ridin' right along there beside him
 On that broomstick pony of mine"
 
 "And you know his pistol never ran out of bullets
 When the bad guys had to be stopped
 And somehow his bullets never drew any blood
 But the bad guys dropped when he shot"
 
 "Yeah, old Gene was an image of justice
 And goodness and purity
 And in the eyes of a poor, little country boy
 He made the world look better to me"
 
 Singin', "Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
 Put him back in the saddle again
 Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
 Back in the saddle again"
 
 "And you know the way
 He rescued the rancher's daughter
 He'd sent a thrill right up the aisle
 And the endin' would always send us home
 With a good victorious smile"
 
 "Now you ask me, 'Who's Gene Autry?'
 Well, son, go ahead and watch the show
 And then ride off into the sunset with him
 Like I did forty years ago"
 
 Singin', "Whoopi tai ai oh, rockin' to and fro
 Put him back in the saddle again
 Whoopi tai ai yeh, let him go on his way
 Back in the saddle again"
 
 Why do you punish me for loving you 
 You're counting my mistakes how about yours 
 Why do you sentence me too nice of tears 
 Convicting all these dreams I've dreamed for all these years 
 My heart cries out behind these prison bars 
 It pleads to you for your true love to set it free 
 Why do you punish me is love a crime 
 If so I'll spend the lifetime loving serving time 
  
 My heart cries out behind...
 
 Why me Lord 
 What have I ever done
 To deserve even one
 Of the blessings I've known

 I am a lineman for the county
 And I drive the main road
 Searchin' in the sun for another overload
 I hear you singin' in the wire,
 I can hear you through the whine
 And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
 
 I know I need a small vacation
 But it don't look like rain
 And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
 And I need you more than want you,
 And I want you for all time
 And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
 
 And I need you more than want you,
 And I want you for all time
 And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
 
 Well, you said you had enough
 You said that you were leavin?
 I said, "Shove off honey, baby, I ain't grievin'
 Pack your bags and pull out this evenin?
 There's a wide open road"
 
 On Saturday mornin' you where nowhere about it
 And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out
 I looked north, east and west and then a leadin' south
 I saw a wide open road
 
 there's a wide open road
 It?s leadin? south from my abode
 If you stick around and turn your damper down
 There's a wide open road
 
 Well, the reason I was lookin? for you all over town
 Was to tell you that your kitty cat is still around
 And you left your weddin' ring when you went
 Down that wide open road
 
 If you gonna stay away then honey let me know
 How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll a dough
 Every thing's gone crazy since I told you to go
 Down that wide open road
 
 there's a wide open road
 And honey, I want you to know
 You can look down south or you can turn back home
 And there's a wide open road
 
 Oh I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
 With the rose so red and the lilies so fair
 And the mirltes so bright with the emerald dew
 The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue
 
 I will dance I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
 I will charm every heart in her crown I will sway
 When I woke from my dreaming my idols were clay
 All portions of love had all blown away
 
 Oh she taught me to love her and promised to love
 And to cherish me over all others above
 How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
 She left me no warning no words of farewell
 
 Yes she taught me to love her and call me her flower
 That was blooming to cheer her through life's dreary hour
 Oh I long to see her and regret the dark hour
 She's gone and neglected her pale wildwood flower
 
 There's a wildwood in the pines where the family used to gather
 There's a little shady grove where they built a country church
 They was singing in the ground Baptisin' in the river
 Glory! Hallelujah, brother! Sweet salvation there was found
 
 So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the
 land that lies up yonder
 I believe that there are streets there paved with gold
 There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' hallelujah!
 I believe that Jesus loves me I can feel it in my soul
 
 There's a long and windin' road that I long once more to travel
 There's a home place in my heart sittin' high upon a hill
 There's a rosewood rockin' chair and a place set at the table
 Guess I better have a little talk with Jesus Maybe he can take me there
 
 So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the
 land that lies up yonder
 I believe that there are streets there paved with gold
 There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' hallelujah!
 I believe that Jesus loves me I can feel it in my soul
 
 So I believe that the saints go side-by-side in the
 land that lies up yonder
 I believe that there are streets there paved with gold
 There are people on their feet shoutin', singin' hallelujah!
 I believe that Jesus loves me I can feel it in my soul
 
 I was standing by my window,
 On one cold and cloudy day
 When I saw that hearse come rolling
 For to carry my mother away
 
 Will the circle be unbroken
 By and by, lord, by and by
 There's a better home a-waiting
 In the sky, lord, in the sky
 
 I said to that undertaker
 Undertaker please drive slow
 For this lady you are carrying
 Lord, I hate to see here go
 
 Will the circle be unbroken
 By and by, lord, by and by
 There's a better home a-waiting
 In the sky, lord, in the sky
 
 Oh, I followed close behind her
 Tried to hold up and be brave
 But I could not hide my sorrow
 When they laid her in the grave
 
 Will the circle be unbroken
 By and by, lord, by and by
 There's a better home a-waiting
 In the sky, lord, in the sky
 
 I went back home, my home was lonesome
 Missed my mother, she was gone
 All of my brothers, sisters crying
 What a home so sad and lone
 
 Will the circle be unbroken
 By and by, lord, by and by
 There's a better home a-waiting
 In the sky, lord, in the sky
 
 We sang the songs of childhood
 Hymns of faith that made us strong
 Ones that mother Maybelle taught us
 Hear the angels sing along
 
 Will the circle be unbroken
 By and by, lord, by and by
 There's a better home a-waiting
 In the sky, lord, in the sky
 
 Will the circle be unbroken
 By and by, lord, by and by
 There's a better home a-waiting
 In the sky, lord, in the sky
 
 Wings in the morning and license to fly
 Straight to the portals of never more die
 Never more pain in them old aching bones
 Wings in the morning to carry us home
 
 My grandfather lived by the book all his life
 On rich bottom land with twelve kids and a wife
 He never saw TV, nor rode a jet plane
 But he knew that heaven was holding his claim
 
 The salt of the earth, yet with faith in the Lord
 They all got together in that one accord
 And what could be greater than God's guarantee
 That we can have heaven for eternity?
 
 Rocks in the road and we stumble and fall
 Lights getting low, so we don't see at all
 But I promise you, on that getting up day
 Wings in the morning, we'll fly away
 
 Without love, I am half human
 Without love, I'm more machine
 Without love, there's nothing doin'
 I will die without love
 
 Without love I am an island
 All by myself in a heartbreak sea
 Without love there's no denying
 I am dying without love
 
 Oh there is nowhere I can run
 And there is no hiding place
 Sticking out like a sore thumb
 By the gloomy look upon my face
 
 Without love I'm incomplete
 Without love, I am not whole
 Without love, I'm barely on my feet
 I am dying without love
 
 Oh there is nowhere I can run
 And there is no hiding place
 Sticking out like a sore thumb
 By the gloomy look upon my face
 
 Without love I'm incomplete
 Without love, I am not whole
 Without love, I'm barely on my feet
 
 I am dying without love
 I am dying without love
 Oh yes I'm dying without love
 
 It takes a worried man to sing worried song
 It takes a worried man to sing worried song
 I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
 
 I went across the river, and I lay down to sleep
 I went across the river, and I lay down to sleep
 When I woke up, had shackles on my feet
 
 Twenty nine links of chain around my leg
 Twenty nine links of chain around my leg
 And on each link, the initial of my name
 
 It takes a worried man to sing worried song
 It takes a worried man to sing worried song
 I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
 
 I asked that judge, tell me, what might be my fine
 I asked that judge, tell me, what might be my fine
 Twenty one years on the R C Mountain line
 
 The train arrived, sixteen coaches long
 The train arrived, sixteen coaches long
 The girl I love is on that train and gone
 
 It takes a worried man to sing worried song
 It takes a worried man to sing worried song
 I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
 
 If anyone asks you who composed this song
 If anyone asks you who composed this song
 Tell 'em t'was I, and I sing it all day long
 
 It takes a worried man to sing worried song
 It takes a worried man to sing worried song
 I'm worried now but I won't be worried long
 
 Would you lay with me in a field of stone
 If my need's were strong would you lay with me
 Should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
 In the midnight hour if my lips were dry
 
 Would you go away to another land
 Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
 Wipe the blood away from my dying hand
 If I gave myself to you
 
 Will you bathe me with me in the stream of life
 When the moon is full will you bathe with me
 
 Will you still love me when I'm down and out
 In my time of trials will you stand by me
 
 Would you go away to another land
 Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
 Wipe the away blood from my dying hand
 If I gave myself to you
 
 Would you lay with me in a field of stone
 If my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
 
 Would you bathe me with me in the stream of life
 Will you still love me when I'm down and out
 
 Would you lay with me in a field of stone
 When the moon is full will you lay with me
 
 Would you lay with me in a field of stone
 If my need's were strong would you lay with me
 Should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
 In the midnight hour if my lips were dry
 
 Would you go away to another land
 Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
 Wipe the blood away from my dying hand
 If I gave myself to you
 
 Will you bathe me with me in the stream of life
 When the moon is full will you bathe with me
 
 Will you still love me when I'm down and out
 In my time of trials will you stand by me
 
 Would you go away to another land
 Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
 Wipe the away blood from my dying hand
 If I gave myself to you
 
 Would you lay with me in a field of stone
 If my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
 
 Would you bathe me with me in the stream of life
 Will you still love me when I'm down and out
 
 Would you lay with me in a field of stone
 When the moon is full will you lay with me
 
 Well, they gave him his orders in Monroe, Virginian,
 Said, "Steve, you're way behind time,
 "This is not 38, this is Ol'97,
 "Put her into Spencer on time."
 
 Then he turned around and said to his black, greasy fireman,
 "Shovel on a little more coal.
 And when we cross that White Oak mountain,
 "Watch Ol'97 roll."
 
 And then a telegram come from Washington station,
 This is how it read,
 "Oh that brave engineer that run '97,
 "Is lyin' in Danville dead."
 
 "Cause he was going down a grade making 90 miles an hour,
 The whistle broke into a scream.
 He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle,
 Scalded to death by the steam."
 
 One more time!
 
 Oh, now all you ladies you better take a warning,
 From this time on and learn.
 Never speak harsh to your true-lovin' husband,
 He may leave you and never return.
 
 Poor Boy.
 
 I want to thank you. Yeah, it's good to see you
 
 I've got a lot of blues on my mind
 And at least a million miles behind me
 And all that I've got between me
 And pauper's hill 
 Is a wrinkled, crinkled, wadded dollar bill
 
 Lake Michigan wind sure is cold
 And I need me a jacket for my shoulders
 I could buy one down at the surplus store
 Cheap cotton twill 
 With my wrinkled, crinkled, wadded dollar bill
 
 But I'm not bound 
 And I never will
 Be to a wrinkled, crinkled, wadded dollar bill
 
 It sure smells good at the bakery
 And I stand and let the smell flood over me
 They sell them day old cakes mighty cheaply
 I could eat my fill
 With my wrinkled, crinkled, wadded dollar bill
 
 But I'm not bound
 And I never will
 Be to a wrinkled, crinkled, wadded dollar bill
 
 Lake Michigan waves hit the beach
 And I stand and let them wash at my feet
 And then I throw it just as far as I can
 Into the chill 
 My wrinkled, crinkled, wadded dollar bill
 
 For I'm not bound
 And I never will
 Be to a wrinkled, crinkled, wadded dollar bill
 
 No I'm not bound
 And I never will
 Be to a wrinkled, crinkled, wadded dollar bill
 
 
 Like a sweet rippling mountain stream
 Goes the sound of the banjo on Cripple Creek
 Never beginning never ending just rippling on and on
 So does the land just ripple on and on
 
 As a heart gets soft on a woman
 So can the heart get soft on the land
 And to fall in love with a woman
 As well as the land is to surely be in love
 
 I stayed away too long I know
 And every day was slow to go
 Every night I dreamed I was here
 It's been a mighty lonely year
 
 Every mile I needed you
 I kinda hope that you needed me too
 Everywhere I saw your face around
 Every town I was in
 
 This old familiar place welcomed me again
 Back to where I belonged
 To be back to you and Tennessee
 Back to you and Tennessee
 
 Beside the Cumberland River
 Where the grass is soft and sweet
 We ran across the fields of cedar
 Hiding from the noisy streets
 
 And when the leaves fell from the cold
 The stars were silver the moon was gold
 I said it's yours with love from me
 I'm planting my roots in this ground
 
 And when they look for me I'll be found
 With something that is part of me
 You and Tennessee
 Back with you and Tennessee
 
 The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
 I dreamed I held you in my arms
 But when I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
 So I hung my head and I cried
 
 You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
 You make me happy when skies are gray
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you
 Please don't take my sunshine away
 
 I'll always love you and make you happy
 If you will only say the same
 But if you leave me and love another
 You'll regret it all some day
 
 You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
 You make me happy when skies are gray
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you
 Please don't take my sunshine away
 
 You told me once, dear, you really loved me
 And no one else could come between
 But now you've left me and love another
 You have shattered all of my dreams
 
 You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
 You make me happy when skies are gray
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you
 Please don't take my sunshine away
 
 In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
 When I awake my poor heart pains
 So when you come back and make me happy
 I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame
 
 You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
 You make me happy when skies are gray
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you
 Please don't take my sunshine away
 
 I've walked through every town
 saw fortunes lost and found
 And when your trail fails
 I walked hole in both my soles
 But I don't expect you back
 You're somewhere making tracks
 I crossed your burning bridges
 And walked through miles of sand
 Met the lawless and the law
 But you beat all I ever saw.
 
 I've dreamed a million miles
 About your eyes and smiles
 I tried to love the best
 And turn from all the rest
 I've scanned the skies for you
 and I only saw your hue
 But they threw away the mold
 you were made of frozen gold.
 Your heart would never thaw
 You beat all I ever saw.
 
 You belong to my heart now and forever
 We were there beneath the stars while a million guitars
 Played our love song
 When they said i love you
 Every beat of my heart said it too
 
 Do you remember
 Darling you'll hear that song
 And you'll always belong to my heart
 
 I know that you wonder who I dream about
 And if I've met someone who thrills me so
 Well, I finally met a girl who turns me inside out
 I'll tell you about her, for you ought to know
 
 You comb her hair every mornin'
 And make sure she's dressed just right
 You comb her hair every mornin'
 And put her to bed every night
 
 When she's around me, sometimes I can hardly speak
 I stammer and I walk right into doors
 And just to hold her hand in mine makes me feel weak
 Oh, you know her, honey, don't you know it's you
 
 You comb her hair every mornin'
 And make sure she's dressed just right
 You comb her hair every mornin'
 And put her to bed every night
 
 
 You were young and needed love and I was wild and free
 But every time you said a prayer you said a prayer for me
 Why the ring upon your hand we vowed fidelity
 There were times when I forgot but you remembered me
 
 You remembered only that wedding bells would ring
 You remembered only to count the days till spring
 You knew only love and honor but I couldn't see
 I regret that I forgot cause you remembered me
 
 I believed that promises were made to break apart
 But every time I broke a vow I always broke your heart
 So here's to you God bless you now wherever you may be
 There were times that I forgot but you remembered me
 
 You remembered only
 
 Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
 Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she lied
 I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she said goodbye
 Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
 You tell me then I'll tell you
 I'll tell you why I loved her tell me why she said goodbye
 Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
 
 Tell me why I'm lonely I'll tell you why I'm alone
 Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she's gone
 I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she was untrue
 Tell me why she left me and I'll tell you why I'm blue
 You tell me then I'll tell you
 
 It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 It don't matter, anyhow
 An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
 If you don't know by now
 When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
 Look out your window and I'll be gone
 You're the reason I'm travelin' on
 Don't think twice, it's all right
 
 It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
 That light I never knowed
 An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
 I'm on the dark side of the road
 Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
 To try and make me change my mind and stay
 We never did too much talkin' anyway
 So don't think twice, it's all right
 
 It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
 Like you never did before
 It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
 I can't hear you any more
 I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin' all the way down the road
 I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
 I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
 But don't think twice, it's all right
 
 I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
 Where I'm bound, I can't tell
 But goodbye's too good a word, gal
 So I'll just say fare thee well
 I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
 You could have done better but I don't mind
 You just kinda wasted my precious time
 But don't think twice, it's all right
 
 The news is out all over town
 That you've been seen out runnin' around
 I know that I should leave, but then
 I just can't go
 
 You win again
 This heart of mine could never see
 What everybody knows but me
 Just trusting in you was my great sin
 
 What can I do
 You win again
 Yes this heart of mine could never see
 What everybody knows but me
 
 Just trusting in you was my great sin
 What can I do
 You win again
 
 I can see now that you've stacked the cards so I leave you with my best regards 
 When you play to feel with nothing left to show look for me you won't have far to go 
 Love's a gamble and I'm a gamblin' man I've done everything to make you understand 
 But the odds are high and luck is running low look for me you won't have far to go 
 You won't have far to go if you want me cause I'm gonna stick close to you 
 And I'm not the kind to say I told you so look for me you won't have far to go 
  
 You won't have far to go...
 
 When you walk through a storm
 Hold your head up high
 An don't be afraid of the dark
 At the end of the storm
 Is a golden sky
 And the sweet, silver song of a lark
 
 Walk on through the wind
 Walk on through the rain
 Though your dreams be tossed and blown
 Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
 And you'll never walk alone
 You'll never walk alone
 
 Walk on through the wind
 Walk on through the rain
 Though your dreams be tossed and blown
 Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart
 And you'll never walk alone
 You'll never walk alone
 
 When you're all alone and blue
 No one to tell your troubles to
 Remember me, I'm the one who loves you 
 
 When this world has turned you down
 And not a true friend can be found
 Remember me, I'm the one who loves you 
 
 And through all kinds of weather
 You'll find I'll never change
 Through the sunshine and the shadows
 I'll always be the same 
 
 We're together right or wrong
 Where you go I'll tag along
 Remember me, I'm the one who loves you 
 
 (And through all kinds of weather
 You'll find I'll never change)
 Through the sunshine and the shadows
 I'll always be the same 
 
 We're together right or wrong
 Where you go I'll tag along
 Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
 Remember me, I'm the one who loves you
 
 I love that hair, long an' black
 Hangin' down to the middle of your back
 Don't cut it off whatever you do
 I need it to run my fingers through
 
 'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
 Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby
 
 Got me a dollar that I saved
 Saved it up for a rainy day
 Everybody's callin' for bills that's due
 But they don't catch me, I'll spend it on you
 
 'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
 Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby
 
 Got me a guitar, got a six strings
 And a picker to make 'em ring
 Every string's gotta know what to do
 'Cause I'm gonna use 'em to serenade you
 
 'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
 Don't mean maybe, you're my baby
 
 Well, I had me a gal, she said she's mine
 But she run around on me all the time
 Now she's gone an' I'm glad we're through
 'Cause I'm plum-flipped over you
 
 'Cause you're my baby, uh huh uh, you're my sugar
 Don't mean maybe, you're my, baby
 
 Oh, baby, baby, yeah you're my baby
 Well, I don't mean maybe
 You drive me crazy
 I love you, baby, you're my, babydoll
 
 I have sailed the peaceful waters 
 Of the ocean deep and blue
 I held my breath and watched
 The western sunset's golden hue
 
 I've flown above the mountain peaks
 And valley's wide and green
 But you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
 
 You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
 I have searched for happiness so long and far
 But my search for love was through
 The day that I found you
 'Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
 
 I confess that I've been tempted
 By a luring magic charm
 When a smile was flashed my way
 And stood before two open arms
 But I turned and walked away because 
 I love you like I do
 You're the nearest thing to heaven, darling you
 
 You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
 I have searched for happiness so long and far
 But my search for love was through
 The day that I found you
 'Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
 
 I have watched the silver raindrops
 Fall to earth to cool the day
 Watched the rainbow at twilight
 When the clouds had blown away
 I loved the pretty flowers
 But he cannot buy their worth
 But you're the nearest thing to heaven on this earth
 
 You're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
 I have searched for happiness for long and far
 But my search for love was through
 The day that I found you
 'Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven, yes you are
 
 You're the only star in my blue heaven
 And I'm waiting just for you
 You're the only star in my blue heaven
 And in dreams your face i see
 
 Well you're the guiding light
 That brightens up the night
 And i see your face in my dreams
 You're the only star in my blue heaven
 And I'm waiting just for you
 
 You've got a new light shining in your eyes
 And I can see now right where your beauty lies
 And it's showin' in your face that your heart has found a place
 And I can hear it in your whisper and your sighs
 
 You've got a new way of doing things you do
 And it's plain to see there's been a change in you
 And I wonder could it be that the change is due to me
 For I have felt a certain something too
 
 You've got a way about you now that you never had before
 You've got a look you're wearin' now like no look you ever wore
 I tried to hide it for a while but now I realize
 You've got a new light shining in your eyes
 
 You've got a way about you now that you never had before
 You've got a look you're wearin' now like no look you ever wore
 I tried to hide it for a while but now I realize
 You've got a new light shining in your eyes
 
 You've got a new light shining in your eyes
 
 Your cheating heart will make you weep you'll cry and cry you'll try to sleep
 But sleep won't come the whole night through your cheating heart will tell on you
 When tears come down like falling rain you'll toss around and call my name
 You're gonna walk the floor the way I do your cheating heart is gonna tell on you
 
 Yes when tears're coming down...
 
 
 Well, the diamonds fades quickly when matched to the face of Maria
 All the harps they sound empty when she lifts her lips to the sky
 The brown of her skin makes her hair seem a soft golden rainfall
 That spills from the mountains to the bottomless depths of her eyes
 
 Well, she stands all around me her hands slowly sifting the sunshine
 All the laughter that linger down deep 'neath her smilin' is free
 Well, it spins and it twirls like a hummingbird lost in the morning
 And caresses the south wind and silently sails to the sea
 
 Ah, the sculptor stands stricken and the artist he throws away his brushes
 When her image comes dancin' the sun she turns sullen with shame
 And the birds they go silent the wind stops his sad mournful singing
 When the trees of the forest start gently to whisper'in her name
 
 So as softly she wanders I'll desperately follow her footsteps
 And I'll chase after shadows that offer a trace of her sight
 Ah, they promise eternally that she lays hidden within them
 But I find they've deceived me and sadly I bid them goodbye
 
 So the serpent slide softly away with these moments of laughter
 And the the old washy woman has finish her cleanin' and gone
 But the bamboo hang heavy in the bondage of quicksilver daydreams
 And a lonely child longingly looks for a place to belong
 
 Here I am in the 21st century
 I have to say it ain't as cool as I hoped it would be
 No man on the moon, nobody on Mars
 Where the hell is my flying car?
 Ain't nothing even like a teletransporter so far
 
 It's hard times in the new millenium
 Gettin' by on just the bare minimum
 Everything to lose and nothing to spare
 Going to hell and nobody cares
 Ain't the future that Kennedy promised me
 In the 21st century
 
 Finally come to the age of Aquarius
 And if we live through the Mayan apocalypse
 There'll be pie in the sky above lemonade springs
 A goddamn American utopian dream
 If you believe that then you're more optimistic than me
 
 Lights out in the heart of America
 No love in a time of hysteria
 It's head for the hills, every man for himself
 Nobody helping out nobody else
 Ain't the way that the Maharishi said it would be
 In the 21st century
 
 Pray for guidance, beg forgiveness
 Vote for change and hope they find this
 Only thing I know for sure is:
 We stand now on the verge of history
 The world can be anything that we want it to be
 
 Where there's a will, there's a way
 When there's a fire, there's a spark
 Out in the streets, downtown in the park
 Baby, the future's just waitin' on you and me
 In the 21st century
 
 In the 21st century
 
 There's a full moon out tonight
 And it's shining down on me
 And in that purest light
 Any fool could see
 
 That this highway is paved with sorrow
 And every mile is lined with pain
 And when the sun comes up tomorrow
 You'll be just as far away
 
 Now I hear her whisper soft and low
 Through every mile I run
 As I travel through this world of woe
 With a Bible and a gun
 
 If a man was made to suffer
 I'm a mighty man I know
 From one heartache to another
 I've been burning down this road
 
 I've got one eye on the mirror
 And one eye on the line
 The end keeps growing nearer
 The past slips behind
 
 I don't mean to hurt nobody
 I don't mean to do no wrong
 But something out there's got me
 And it's pulling me along
 
 Darkness is my shelter
 Emptiness my light
 And stranger, heaven help you
 If our paths cross tonight
 
 A country song left the farm
 As the young man marched to war
 Became a sound heard clear around the world
 From a lonely soldier's guitar
 Who had never been so far before
 For mom and dad and a special little girl
 And cutting through the quiet like a whistle in the night
 A train of memories and even city boys could ride
 
 Mountain high, valley low
 Proud and strong, a country song
 
 Meanwhile cross the water
 The mothers and the daughters
 Were working in the defense factories
 All up and down the line
 The machines and women whined
 A country song as blue as the sea
 That stretched so far between
 Like the prayers and the dreams
 Of the men who where fighting to keep their country free
 
 Though it seemed to take forever
 They were finally back together
 And the young men took a restless look around
 Cause it seemed the world unfolded
 And the land just couldn't hold 'em
 So they headed for the cities and the towns
 They could feel the home fires glow
 As they gathered around the radio
 To hear the grand old opry as the weekend rolled around
 
 There's a kid out on the highway
 Who says he's got some dues to pay
 So he set out with a guitar and a dream
 He don't look much like a cowboy
 But he swears he's going to make some noise
 Change a tune or two in Tennessee
 Though his hands had never worked the land
 His granddad was a railroad man
 He sang him Jimmie Rodgers songs as he sat upon his knee
 
 I don't fall in love as a rule
 Because it always makes me look like a fool
 Well, it keeps me up late
 I can't concentrate
 And I pride myself on keeping my cool
 But I got to admit
 I'm just a little bit in love with you
 
 Now, I don't want you getting me wrong
 Because I don't sit up at night by the phone
 Well, if you come around
 I let my guard down
 And I just can't seem to leave you alone
 But I'll get over it
 I'm just a little bit in love with you
 
 Well, I tell myself that a little bit of love
 Can't hurt a big man like me
 But I never have heard of a little heart ache
 And baby, that's what's scaring me
 
 So don't you get your hopes up if I call
 Because I always catch myself when I fall
 But I got to admit
 That I'm a little bit in love with you
 
 So don't you get your hopes up if I call
 Because I always catch myself when I fall
 But I got to admit
 That I'm a little bit in love with you
 
 Oh, honey, that's all you get
 I'm just a little bit in love with you
 
 I'm a travelin' man wherever I roam all over this land I'm never alone
 'Cause I'm acquainted with the wind and me and him
 Keep travelin' along
 
 No shelter from the storm no pillow for my head
 'Cept for maybe my arm
 But I'm sleepin' like the dead no ceilin' but the sky
 And here I lie
 And in the mornin' I'll be gone
 
 Whenever I please
 I'm howlin' like a gale
 I'm whisperin' like a breeze I'm acquainted with the wind and I reckon that it's him that's carryin' me
 
 I'm the ramblin' kind
 No matter where I roll everybody stands aside
 Let's me rumble down the road ain't got a lot of friends
 But I'm acquainted with the wind and we're travelin' along
 
 See that shadow on the wall
 Doesn't look like me at all
 Head hung down
 Intentions meltin' on the ground
 Saddest shape I ever saw
 
 There's so much I need to do
 Before I get over you
 But I can't bother with it all
 Until after Mardi Gras
 All that music in the air
 Happy people everywhere
 Make it hard to sing the blues
 Until Mardi Gras is through
 
 Put my loneliness away
 Save it for a rainy day
 Delay the pain
 Nothin' ventured nothin' gained
 The time'll come but that's okay
 
 Love is where you find it
 When you find no love at home
 And there's nothin' cold as ashes
 After the fire is gone
 
 The bottle is almost empty
 The clock just now struck ten
 Darlin' I had to call you
 To our favorite place again
 
 We know it's wrong for us to meet
 But the fire's gone out at home
 And there's nothin' cold as ashes
 After the fire is gone
 
 Love is where you find it
 When you find no love at home
 And there's nothin' cold as ashes
 After the fire is gone
 
 Your lips are warm and tender
 Your arms hold me just right
 Sweet words of love you remember
 That the one at home forgot
 
 Each time we say is the last time
 But we keep hangin' on
 And there's nothin' cold as ashes
 After the fire is gone
 
 Love is where you find it
 When you find no love at home
 And there's nothin' cold as ashes
 After the fire is gone
 
 Down the road a ways, I heard say there's a new day comin' on
 Where the women folks are friendly and the law leaves you alone
 I'll believe it when I see it but I haven't seen it yet
 Don't mind me just keep on talkin', I'm just looking for my hat
 
 Ain't no god in Mexico
 Ain't no way to understand
 How that border crossing feeling makes a fool out of a man
 If I had not seen the sunshine, hell, I would not cuss the rain
 If my feet would fit a railroad track, guess I'd a-been a train
 
 Me and Louise Higginbotham used to chase across the yard
 Back in 1947, that's when more than times were hard
 Pity me I didn't see the line in time and like a fool
 In front of god and everybody, I politely blew my cool
 
 Ain't no god in Mexico
 Ain't no comfort in the can
 When you're down in Matamoros gettin' busted by the man
 If I had not seen the sunshine, I would not cuss the rain
 If my feet would fit a railroad track, guess I'd a-been a train
 
 Ain't no god in Mexico
 Ain't no way to understand
 How that border crossing feeling makes a fool out of a man
 If I had not seen the sunshine, hell, I would not cuss the rain
 If my feet would fit a railroad track, guess I'd a-been a train
 
 Standing on the corner
 Bleaker 8th or 9th
 Money in my pocket
 And women on my mind
 
 I'm free
 Can't nobody tie me down
 Nothing ever worries me
 Ain't nobody's daddy now
 
 Here I say the women
 Are the very finest kind
 Clacking on their high heels
 Like an engine down the line
 
 I'm free
 Can't nobody tie me down
 Nothing ever worries me
 I ain't nobody's daddy now
 
 I usually have a woman
 Who worry me to death
 Hammers in my pocket
 And a fools was on my neck
 
 And I'm free
 Can't nobody tie me down
 Nothing ever worries me
 Ain't nobody's daddy now
 
 Got a baby on the east side
 Honey on the west
 Got a woman uptown
 But my downtown gal's the best
 
 I'm free
 Can't nobody tie me down
 Nothing ever worries me
 Ain't nobody's daddy now
 
 I'm free
 Can't nobody tie me down
 Nothing ever worries me
 Ain't nobody's daddy now
 
 And I'm free
 Can't nobody tie me down
 Nothing ever worries me
 Ain't nobody's daddy now
 
 I guess I don't get out too much
 If it wasn't enough I hear all these voices
 Always telling me that I'm bad
 But it's all in my head - like all those scary noises
 
 I've been waiting all of my life
 All of my life
 I've been waiting all of my life
 All of my life
 
 Some nights when I'm laying in bed
 Wish I was dead - and I know you'd never miss me
 But I know where you go when you dream
 Strange as that seems cause I never even kissed you
 
 I've been waiting all of my life
 All of my life
 I've been waiting all of my life
 All of my life
 
 Everybody wants to be somebody's something
 Ain't nobody wants to be blue
 Ain't nobody anywhere ever loved nothing
 Half as much as I love you
 Somebody somewhere said love is a prison
 But no one really wants to be free
 I'd have to be crazy to ever think someone
 Could love a nobody like me
 
 I'm here alone in the dark
 But I know where you are
 Cause I can hear you breathing
 Come a little closer you'll find
 You were meant to be mine
 Cause you're the only reason
 
 I've been waiting all of my life
 All of my life
 I've been waiting all of my life
 All of my life
 
 I've been waiting all of my life
 All of my life
 I've been waiting all of my life
 All of my life
 
 Look at ya 
 Yeah, take a look in the mirror now tell me what you see 
 Another satisfied customer in the front of the line for the American dream 
 I remember when we was both out on the boulevard 
 Talkin' revolution and singin' the blues 
 Nowadays it's letters to the editor and cheatin' on our taxes 
 Is the best that we can do 
 Come on 
 
 Look around 
 There's doctors down on Wall Street 
 Sharpenin' their scalpels and tryin' to cut a deal 
 Meanwhile, back at the hospital 
 We got accountants playin' God and countin' out the pills 
 Yeah, I know, that sucks '??'?? that your HMO 
 Ain't doin' what you thought it would do 
 But everybody's gotta die sometime and we can't save everybody 
 It's the best that we can do 
 
 Four score and a hundred and fifty years ago 
 Our forefathers made us equal as long as we can pay 
 Yeah, well maybe that wasn't exactly what they was thinkin' 
 Version six-point-oh of the American way 
 But hey we can just build a great wall around the country club 
 To keep the riff-raff out until the slump is through 
 Yeah, I realize that ain't exactly democratic, but it's either them or us and 
 And it's the best we can do 
 
 Yeah, passionely conservative 
 It's the best we can do 
 
 Conservatively passionate 
 It's the best we can do 
 
 Meanwhile, still thinkin' 
 Hey, let's wage a war on drugs 
 It's the best we can do 
 Well, I don't know about you, but I kinda dig this global warming thing...
 
 Everybody call her angel
 She's no stranger to the devil I know
 His mark is on her body
 His fire's burning in her soul
 When we're making love
 He's laughing at us down below
 She's the devil I know
 
 She's the devil I know
 She's the devil I know
 Said she come from heaven
 Angel is the devil I know
 She's the devil I know
 
 Now she's the kind a woman
 Keep you coming back for more
 Got the kind of face
 You swear you seen someplace before
 Could a been your mamma
 Could a been a Mexican whore
 She's the devil I know
 
 Now she'd drag you straight to hell
 I can tell and I think I'll just go
 Yeah the devil sent her here
 To deliver me body and soul
 Yeah and every inch she drags me down
 I'm closer to the glow
 She's the devil I know
 
 I got a lot of memories tied up in this place
 So much time spent in so little space
 What looked like the world through the eyes of a child
 Kind of closes in on you after a while
 
 It's a place to grow up and a place to grow old
 You keep your mouth shut and you do what you're told
 I told mama the day that I ran
 This ain't no place for an angry young man
 
 Oh mama if you could see me right now
 You'd be so sure you failed me somehow
 Mama you never could understand
 There ain't no peace for an angry young man
 
 A cheap hotel a long way from my home
 So many people make you feel so lone
 Dreams die easy out here in these streets
 Hearts grow cold in the city heat
 
 And I ain't never been the patient kind
 I had to live like I please or die tryin'
 At a filling station with a gun in my hand
 The only way for an angry young man
 
 And mama if you could see me right now
 You'd be so sure you failed me somehow
 Mama you never could understand
 There ain't no peace for an angry young man
 
 I got a lot of memories tied up in this place
 Tonight they're starin' me right in the face
 A lonely grave on the outskirts of town
 It's three in the morning, no one around
 
 Just like a ghost I come out of the night
 But I'll be gone before the morning light
 Mama I hope that you understand
 This ain't no place for an angry young man
 
 Mama if you could see me right now
 You'd be so sure you failed me somehow
 Mama you never could understand
 There ain't no peace for an angry young man
 
 Mama if you could see me right now
 You'd be so sure you failed me somehow
 Mama you never could understand
 There ain't no peace for an angry young man
 
 Yes
 
 Here I am again, now, acting like a crazy fool
 Every time I get to rocking, I always run into you
 I never did understand why you want to be so cruel
 
 Well, Annie, is tonight the night? 
 Do you think the moon is right? 
 You don't have to tell me you will
 Just say that you might
 
 I know you told me once
 I guess you could a told me twice
 I guess I keep hoping some day you're going to treat me nice
 I'm trying to get next to you
 Cold as ice
 
 Well, Annie, is tonight the night? 
 Do you think the moon is right? 
 You don't have to tell me you will
 Just say that you might
 
 Now I'm not fool enough thinking I'm the only one
 Got me coming and a-going till I'm about to come undone
 Not trying to find love
 I'm looking for a little fun
 
 Well, Annie, is tonight the night? 
 Do you think the moon is right? 
 You don't have to tell me you will
 Just say that you might
 
 Well, Annie, is tonight the night? 
 Do you think the moon is right? 
 You don't have to tell me you will
 Just say that you might
 
 One of these days when my minds made up
 And I'm sick and tired of hanging around
 I'll be on my way in a cloud of dust
 On the road to another town
 Once upon a time I loved this house
 Now I'm thinking 'bout burning it down
 And I'll be long gone when the fire burns out
 On the way to another town
 To see another city in another light
 With my past behind me and my future bright
 
 One of these days when I've had enough
 Buddy, you ain't going to see me around
 Just as soon as I get my courage up
 Going to take it to another town
 
 I used to walk these streets with my head held high
 Now I'm always looking down at the ground
 But I see my feet on the outbound side
 Of a road to another town
 
 And I'm going to tell everybody I know
 Yeah I'm going to spread it around
 That there's a great big world out there where I go
 On the road to another town
 To see another city in another light
 With my past behind me and my future bright
 
 One of these days when my mind's made up
 And I'm sick and tired of hanging around
 I'll be down that road in a cloud of dust
 On the way to another town
 
 Lord it's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar
 Where do we take it from here?
 Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
 It's been the same way for years
 We need to change
 
 Everybody told me when I first came to Nashville
 Son you finally got it made
 Old Hank made it here, we're all sure that you will
 But I don't think Hank done it this way
 No, I don't think Hank done it this way, okay
 
 Oh yeah
 
 Ten years on the road, making one night stand
 Speeding my young life away
 Tell me one more time just so I'll understand
 Are you sure Hank done it this way?
 Did old Hank really do it this way? Hey!
 
 Lord I've seen the world with a five-piece band
 Looking at the backside of me
 Singing my songs, one of his now and then
 But I don't think Hank done 'em this way, no
 I don't think Hank done 'em this way, take it!
 
 It's getting light, it's getting late
 And I've looked everywhere and called her name
 Her dad the doctor's down
 The sheriff's standing 'round
 Arianne
 
 We sat by the river's edge
 I slipped in and she slipped off her dress
 She stepped cautiously
 Into that shining stream
 Arianne
 
 There's a place that I can go
 Where her memory still flows
 It cuts a deeper path
 With every season past
 Arianne
 
 I can see her as she sleeps
 A face as still as that river is deep
 Leaves are turning 'round
 White arms, hair of brown
 Arianne
 
 There's a place that I can go
 Where her memory still flows
 It cuts a deeper path
 With every season past
 Arianne
 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 
 A long time ago before the ice and the snow 
 There were giants that walked this land 
 And with each step they took, the mighty mountains shook 
 And the trees took a knee and the seas rolled in 
 
 Then one day they say the sky gave way 
 And death rained down, it made a terrible sound 
 There was fire everywhere and nothin' was spared 
 That walked on the land or flew through the air 
 
 And when it all was over 
 The slate wiped clean with a touch 
 There God stood and he saw it was good 
 And He said
 
 I got girl who live way down south
 A little town they call 'shut my mouth'
 A thousand miles don't mean a doggone thing
 Call her on the phone and it rangle langle lang, and she said
 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, woo
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
 
 My little gal she stands five foot ain't
 I want to hold her but I know I can't
 I only see her when the moon is blue
 Call her on the phone, tell her what I wanna do, and she said
 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, woo
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby you'll find
 You got me hanging on the telephone line
 Walkin' on the ceiling
 And bouncing off the walls
 Feel it baby, baby,
 Can't you hear my wail, my call?
 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, woo
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 Baby, baby, baby, baby
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, woo
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
 
 Baby, let me follow you down
 
 Baby let me follow you down
 Baby let me follow you down
 Well I'll do anything in this God almighty world
 If you'll just let me follow you down
 
 Can I come home with you? 
 I said can I come home with you? 
 Well I'll do anything in this God almighty world
 If you'll just let me follow you down
 
 I'll buy you a diamond ring
 I'll buy you a wedding gown
 And I'll do anything in this God almighty world
 If you'll just let me follow you down
 
 Sometime my baby locks me out
 Stomps her feet, screams and shouts
 I know what that's all about
 My baby's just as mean as me
 
 Sometimes my man don't treat me right
 Shame the way we fuss and fight
 But I give as good as get alright
 My baby's just as mean as me
 
 He's kinda loud and rough
 Drinks wine and all that stuff
 Sometimes I've had enough, then he smiles
 And I reckon I can stay for a while
 
 They say that love is blind
 Especially the passionate kind
 I don't have to apologize
 My baby's just as mean as me
 
 Hard times they come and go
 She's mine and I'm her beau
 He finds some scars to show, never mind
 'Cause they ain't no different than mind
 
 You heard them say that love is blind
 Especially the passionate kind
 I don't have to apologize
 My baby's just as mean as me
 My baby's just as mean as me
 
 Sometimes in the evenings I start to get that feeling 
 Like I'm empty inside 
 I know I'm doin' good now but tonight I'm headed downtown 
 Down by the riverside 
 
 I sit underneath the freeway with an old friend from the old days 
 And a bottle of wine 
 He used to call me "Big Time", said he knew someday that I'd shine 
 Said he'd seen all the signs 
 He said
 
 Keep yourself to yourself 
 Keep your bedroll dry 
 And boy you never can tell 
 What the shadows hide 
 Keep one eye on the ground 
 Pick up whatever you find 
 'Cause you've got no place to fall 
 When your back's to the wall 
 
 He's gettin' old and it's showin' so I asked him how it's goin' 
 He said "I've seen better I guess 
 I've been rained on, I've been frozen, but this here's the life I've chosen 
 If it just wasn't for the loneliness"
 
 Now this river suits me to a T. but if you're trying to raise a family 
 This it ain't no place to be 
 Hell there's a kid down by the dump there, ought to be in grade school somewhere 
 Now he hangs out with me, now I told him
 
 Keep yourself to yourself 
 Keep your bedroll dry 
 And boy you never can tell 
 What the shadows hide 
 Keep one eye on the ground 
 Pick up whatever you find 
 'Cause you've got no place to fall 
 When your back's to the wall 
 
 Well we finished off the bottle and I told him, 
 "Joe I think I ought to be headed uptown
 Well it was late, and I'd been drinkin', drivin' home I got to thinkin' 
 'Bout what's been going down 
 
 'Cause they're nervous down on Wall Street, but they're trying to keep it upbeat 
 Or maybe they just don't care 
 Down at the river eyes are burnin' cause they feel the tables turnin' 
 So if you wind up down there
 
 Just keep yourself to yourself 
 Keep your bedroll dry 
 And boy you never can tell 
 What the shadows hide 
 Keep one eye on the ground 
 Pick up whatever you find 
 'Cause you've got no place to fall 
 When your back's to the wall
 
 Worked the bars and sideshows along the twilight zone
 Only a crowd can make you feel so alone
 And it really hit home
 Booze and pills and powders, you can choose your medicine
 Well here's another goodbye to another good friend
 
 After all is said and done
 Gotta move while its still fun
 Let me walk before they make me run
 After all is said and done
 I gotta move, its still fun
 I'm gonna walk before they make me run
 
 Watched the taillights fading, there ain't a dry eye in the house
 they're laughing and singing
 Started dancing and drinking as I left town
 Gonna find my way to heaven, cause I did my time in hell
 I wasn't looking too good but I was feeling real well
 
 After all is said and done
 I gotta move I had my fun
 Let us walk before they make me run
 
 After all is said and done
 I did alright, I had my fun
 I will walk before they make me run
 
 We signed up in San Antone, my brother Paul and me
 To fight with Ben McCulloch and the Texas infantry
 Well the poster said we'd get a uniform and seven bucks a week
 The best rations in the army and a rifle we could keep
 
 When I first laid eyes on the general I knew he was a fightin' man
 He was every inch a soldier, every word was his command
 Well his eyes were cold as the lead and steel forged into tools of war
 He took the lives of many and the souls of many more
 
 Well they marched us to Missouri and we hardly stopped for rest
 And then he made this speech and said, "We're comin' to the test"
 Well we've got to take Saint Louie boys before the Yankees do
 If we control the Mississippi then the Federals are through
 
 Well they told us that our enemy would all be dressed in blue
 Well they forgot about the winter's cold and the cursed fever too
 My brother died at Wilson's Creek and Lord I seen him fall
 We fell back to the Boston Mountains in the north of Arkansas
 
 Goddamn you Ben McCulloch
 I hate you more than any other man alive
 And when you die you'll be a foot soldier just like me
 In the Devil's infantry
 
 And on the way to Fayetteville we cursed McCulloch's name
 And mourned the dead that we'd left behind and we was carrying the lame
 I killed a boy the other night who'd never even shaved
 I don't even know what I'm fightin' for, I ain't never owned a slave
 So I snuck out of camp and then I heard the news next night
 The Yankees won the battle and McCulloch lost his life, yeh
 
 Goddamn you Ben McCulloch
 I hate you more than any other man alive
 And when you die you'll be a foot soldier just like me
 In the Devil's infantry
 
 If you want to there's the door
 Can't imagine what you're waiting for
 'Cause I know you ain't the kind to ever change your mind
 
 And though
 I taught you everything you know
 I learned a thing or two myself and so I'm gonna miss you when you're gone but I'm better off alone
 
 I
 Can't say that I'm surprised
 'Cause that leavin' look was in your eyes for some time now and I knew
 I was losing you
 
 You
 Ain't never anything but blue
 And now you say you found somebody new you can lay that burden on
 Guess I'm better off alone
 
 Say what you think you gotta say
 Just don't tell me you changed your mind and you're gonna stay I can't tell you what I'd do then
 'Cause I just can't go through that
 
 Again
 'Cause it almost killed me then and I guess I shoulda known that I'm better off alone
 And it's clear the story's shown I'm better off alone
 
 Billy was seventeen and mean as hell
 Bonnie said she was thirty, it was hard to tell
 Now Billy met Bonnie on a Saturday night
 At the dirt track races, it was love at first sight
 
 Now Bonnie was wilder than the west wind blows
 Taught Billy every single thing he knows
 But she never told Billy what she left out
 The part about the trouble when your times runs out
 
 When the thrill is gone, when your deal goes south
 It's all over when your time runs out
 
 Well Bonnie said, "Billy, don't you think it's time
 We moved on a little further down the line"
 So they knocked off a Texaco south of town
 Blew down the highway with the ragtop down
 
 Now Billy woke Bonnie up about daylight
 Said, "You drive honey, I've been up all night"
 Now Billy wasn't sweatin' no APB
 'Cause he didn't leave a single soul alive to see
 
 He was just sixteen, made his mama proud
 That don't mean nothin' when your time runs out
 
 Now Bonnie kept pushin' that Cadillac
 Billy passed out with the seat reared back
 Slept through Louisiana, then just past dark
 Bonnie pulled over in a roadside park
 
 Left Billy sleeping and she called the cops
 He never knew nothin' when the dime was dropped
 Now Bonnie knew what she had to do
 She called the sheriff and she cried on cue
 
 And the state police rousted Billy out
 He was dreaming about Bonnie when his time run out
 
 Well the sheriff told Billy, "Boy, you're bound to die
 'Cause this young lady's gonna testify
 That you done took her off against her will
 And she told us about the robbery and the boy you killed"
 Now the judge said, "Billy, what you got to say
 Before I have the sheriff carry you away"
 Now Billy looked Bonnie right in the eye
 But he didn't even have to ask her why
 But he turned around when they led him out
 He said I'll see you down in hell when your time runs out
 
 My name is Billy Austin
 I'm Twenty-Nine years old
 I was born in Oklahoma
 Quarter Cherokee I'm told
 Don't remember Oklahoma
 Been so long since I left home
 Seems like I've always been in prison
 Like I've always been alone
 Didn't mean to hurt nobody
 Never thought I'd cross that line
 I held up a filling station
 Like I'd done a hundred times
 The kid done like I told him
 He lay face down on the floor
 Guess I'll never know what made me
 Turn and walk back through that door
 The shot rang out like thunder
 My ears rang like a bell
 No one came runnin'
 So I called the cops myself
 Took their time to get there
 And I guess I could'a run
 I knew I should be feeling something
 But I never shed tear one
 I didn't even make the papers
 'Cause I only killed one man
 But my trial was over quickly
 And then the long hard wait began
 Court appointed lawyer
 Couldn't look me in the eye
 He just stood up and closed his briefcase
 When they sentenced me to die
 Now my waitin's over
 As the final hour drags by
 I ain't about to tell you
 That I don't deserve to die
 But there's twenty-seven men here
 Mostly black, brown and poor
 Most of em are guilty
 Who are you to say for sure?
 So when the preacher comes to get me
 And they shave off all my hair
 Could you take that long walk with me
 Knowing hell is waitin' there
 Could you pull that switch yourself sir
 With a sure and steady hand
 Could you still tell youself
 That you're better than I am
 My name is Billy Austin
 I'm twenty-nine years old
 I was born in Oklahoma
 Quarter Cherokee I'm told
 
 Standing on the corner
 I didn't mean no harm
 When a big policeman
 Grabbed me by the arm
 Now, it was down in Memphis
 On the corner of Beale and Main
 He said "Now, hey big boy
 I'm gonna have to know your name"
 
 Now, you can find my name
 On the tail of my shirt
 I'm a Tennessee hustler
 And I never have to work
 But I'm telling all you rounders
 You best leave my women alone
 I'll take my 38 Special
 And I'll run you rounders home
 
 I got a brand new companion
 Man, I'm gonna do my best this time
 I got a brand new companion
 Man, I'm gonna do my best this time
 You know she cools me with her breathin'
 Chases away those howlin' bottles of wine
 
 She fits just like my guitar
 Man, she's near as tall as me
 She fits just like my guitar
 She's near as tall as me
 She lives way out the d train
 But she's texas as can be
 
 She got a home-spun disposition
 Man, she's just as gentle as you please
 She got a home-spun disposition
 Man, she's just as gentle as you please
 She got arms just like two rattle snakes
 Legs just like a billow in the breeze
 
 I got a brand new companion
 Man, I'm gonna do my best this time
 I got a brand new companion
 Man, I'm gonna do my best this time
 I want to trace her with my body
 I want to track her with my mind
 
 Baby, last night I was watchin' my headlights flashin' on the guard rail
 Now it's early in the mornin' and I'm still runnin' like the devil was on my trail
 
 Well, say why why why would a man treat a woman that way?
 I say cry cry cry, she's never gonna make me stay
 
 Now I'm ridin' on the wheels of fortune
 I'm spinnin' like a weather vane
 I feel my shotgun when I see my shadow
 It's headed down the breakdown lane
 Headed down the breakdown lane
 
 Now I've heard all the songs about the endless highway
 Sung a couple of 'em myself
 But the road ain't nothin' but a place to go
 When you ain't got anyplace else
 
 Why why why would a man treat a woman that way?
 I say cry cry cry, she's never gonna make me stay
 
 Now I'm ridin' on the wheels of fortune
 I'm spinnin' like a weather vane
 I feel my shotgun when I can see my shadow
 It's headed down the breakdown lane
 Headed down the breakdown lane

 'Fore I was born, there were no limitations 
 Said my goodbyes at the greyhound station 
 Here I am half a mile from where I grew up 
 In a parking lot sittin' in my pickup truck
 
 And I'm thinkin' bout burnin' it down, boys 
 Thinkin' bout burnin' it down 
 Nothin's ever gonna be the same in this town
 
 Ten gallons of gas and a bottle of propane 
 I took the lighter off my grill and I still can't 
 Say for certain that this thing'll blow. 
 But if it does I'm gonna be the first one to know.
 
 I'm thinkin' bout burnin' it down, boys 
 Thinkin' bout burnin' it down 
 Nothin's ever gonna be the same in this town 
 I'm thinkin' bout burnin' the Walmart down. 
 
 Always used to say I'd come back some day and settle down. 
 I'm getting old. Got no place to go. It's all come unwound.
 
 So I'm watching' the faces comin' and goin' 
 Some of them strangers some that I know and 
 It doesn't matter how much, how long I wait. 
 'Cause the door's always open and it's never too late.
 
 And I'm thinkin' bout burnin' it down, boys 
 Thinkin' bout burnin' it down 
 Nothin's ever gonna be the same in this town 
 And I'm thinkin' bout burnin' it down, boys 
 Thinkin' bout burnin' it down 
 Nothin's ever gonna be the same in this town 
 I'm thinkin' bout burnin' the Walmart down. 
 Thinkin' bout burnin' the Walmart down. 
 I'm thinkin' bout burnin' it down.
 
 Everybody's out to get me 
 See it in their eyes 
 Hardly see the way they look at me 
 When I go cruisin' by 
 
 Cadillac, Cadillac 
 I'm a Coupe de Ville built for thrill 
 Cadillac 
 
 I got chrome everywhere I need it 
 Rolled and pleated front to back 
 If you don't think I got it made 
 You ought to see me dressed in black 
 
 Cadillac, Cadillac 
 I'm a Coupe de Ville built for thrill 
 Cadillac 
 
 Now, if you've got a woman 
 There's one thing for sure 
 If you want to keep her 
 You best keep her from my door 
 
 Cadillac, Cadillac 
 I'm a Coupe de Ville built for thrill 
 Cadillac 
 
 Cadillac 
 Oh, Cadillac
 
 Half a case of cold pills soaking in a milk jug
 Hydrochloric acid, iontophoresis
 Careful not get any on ya when ya shake it up
 That's the way we cook it up in Calico County
 Calico County
 
 Born in a double wide out behind the county dump
 Mama never told me why daddy didn't live with us
 Only picture I had he's climbing on the prison bus
 Stencil on his back said "Calico County"
 Calico County
 
 My little brother Bobby stole a Coca-Cola truck
 Drove it through the cemetery
 Bobby don't give a fuck
 Thirteen tombstones flipped and  hundred bucks
 Ain't that much money in Calico County
 Calico County
 
 "Out of here some day"
 Ain't that what they used to say
 Army wouldn't take me so I guess I'm gonna have to stay
 Friday night, dog fight
 Sucking on a meth pipe 'til I lay me down to die in Calico County
 Calico County
 Calico County
 
 The first time I saw Carrie Brown 
 She was so young and fair 
 A voice like spring rain fallin' down and sunlight in her hair 
 I'd never seen her face before so I asked all around 
 Her daddy owns a grocery store and she lives in Bristol town 
 
 Carrie darlin' Carrie Carrie Brown I cry 
 If I can't marry Carrie Brown, believe I'd rather die 
 
 I laid my last ten dollars down 
 Though I didn't need a thing 
 Just to touch sweet Carrie Brown 
 
 When she handed me my change 
 I hung around 'til closin' time I scarce believed my eyes 
 My darlin' walkin' arm in arm 
 With a boy named Billy Wise 
 
 I walked around in Bristol town a bitter broken man 
 A heart that pined for Carrie Brown and a pistol in my hand 
 We met again on State Street poor Billy Wise and me 
 I shot him in Virginia and he died in Tennessee 
 
 Now I'm down in the Bristol jail and all I do is cry 
 Cause the jury found me guilty and the judge says I must die 
 I'm just a poor young mountain boy 
 Ain't never been to town 
 And I've come to ruination for the love of Carrie Brown
 
 Yeah cocaine cannot kill my pain
 Cocaine cannot kill my pain
 Cocaine cannot kill my pain
 Like a freight train through my vein
 Cocaine cannot kill my pain
 
 Now whiskey got no hold on me
 Whiskey got no hold on me
 Whiskey got no hold on me
 Left them chains in Tennessee
 Whiskey got no hold on me
 
 Don't come knockin' on my door
 Girl don't come knockin' on my door
 Don't come knockin' on my door
 Even that won't work no more
 Don't come knockin' on my door
 
 'Cause heroin's the only thing
 Heroin's the only thing
 Heroin's the only thing
 The only gift the darkness brings
 Heroin's the only thing
 
 Guess you'd best leave me alone
 Guess you'd best leave me alone
 Guess you'd best leave me alone
 At least until these blues have gone
 Guess you'd best leave me alone
 
 'Cause cocaine cannot kill my pain
 Cocaine cannot kill my pain
 Cocaine cannot kill my pain
 Like a freight train through my vein
 Cocaine cannot kill my pain
 
 It's Christmastime in Washington
 The Democrats rehearsed
 Gettin' into gear for four more years
 Things not gettin' worse
 Republicans drink whiskey neat
 And thanked their lucky stars
 They said, "He cannot seek another term
 They'll be no more FDRs"
 
 I sat home in Tennessee
 Just staring at the screen
 With an uneasy feeling in my chest
 I'm wonderin' what it means
 
 So come back Woody Guthrie
 Come back to us now
 Tear your eyes from paradise
 And rise again somehow
 If you run into Jesus
 Maybe he can help you out
 Come back Woody Guthrie to us now
 
 I followed in your footsteps once
 Back in my travelin' days
 Somewhere I failed to find your trail
 Now I'm stumblin' through the haze
 But there's killers on the highway now
 And a man can't get around
 So I sold my soul for wheels that roll
 Now I'm stuck here in this town
 
 Come back Woody Guthrie
 Come back to us now
 Tear your eyes from paradise
 And rise again somehow
 If you run into Jesus
 Maybe he can help us out
 Come back Woody Guthrie to us now
 
 There's foxes in the hen house
 Cows out in the corn
 The unions have been busted
 Their proud red banners torn
 To listen to the radio
 You'd think that all was well
 But you and me and Cisco know
 It's going straight to hell
 
 So come back, Emma Goldman
 Rise up, old Joe Hill
 The barracades are goin' up
 They cannot break our will
 Come back to us, Malcolm X
 And Martin Luther King
 We're marching into Selma
 As the bells of freedom ring
 
 So come back Woody Guthrie
 Come back to us now
 Tear your eyes from paradise
 And rise again somehow
 
 Livin' in a city of immigrants
 I don't need to go travelin'
 Open my door and the world walks in
 Livin' in a city of immigrants
 Livin' in a city that never sleeps
 My heart keepin' time to a thousand beats
 Singin' in languages I don't speak
 Livin' in a city of immigrants
 
 City of black
 City of white
 City of light
 City of innocents
 City of sweat
 City of tears
 City of prayers
 City of immigrants
 
 Livin' in a city where the dreams of men
 Reach up to touch the sky and then
 Tumble back down to earth again
 Livin' in a city that never quits
 Livin' in a city where the streets are paved
 With good intentions and a people's faith
 In the sacred promise a statue made
 Livin' in a city of immigrants
 
 City of stone
 City of steel
 City of wheels
 Constantly spinnin'
 City of bone
 City of skin
 City of pain
 City of immigrants
 
 All of us are immigrants
 Every daughter, every son
 Everyone is everyone
 All of us are immigrants - everyone
 Livin' in a city of immigrants
 River flows out and the sea rolls in
 Washin' away nearly all of my sins
 Livin' in a city of immigrants
 
 City of black
 City of white
 City of light
 Livin' in a city of immigrants
 City of sweat
 City of tears
 City of prayers
 Livin' in a city of immigrants
 
 City of stone
 City of steel
 City of wheels
 Livin' in a city of immigrants
 
 City of bone
 City of skin
 City of pain
 City of immigrants
 All of us are immigrants, all of us are immigrants
 
 I dreamed you were standing
 On the edge of the world
 And I thought I heard you call out
 With one foot on the rock
 
 And one a cloud
 Was it just the wind that I heard?
 Close your eyes
 This world won't stop spinning you know
 
 Close your eyes
 Why don't you just let go?
 Thousands of people searchin' out there
 Most of 'em lookin' for love
 
 But nothing is something
 That there's plenty of
 In time we'll all get our share
 
 When I was a child
 And they put me to bed
 They always took care that I prayed
 
 But the part that goes, if I should
 Die 'fore I wake
 Echoed all night in my head
 
 I'm goin' out to Denver
 See if I can't find
 I'm goin' out to Denver
 See if I can't find
 That lovin' Colorado girl of mine
 
 The promise in her smile
 Shames the mountains tall
 The promise in her smile
 Shames the mountains tall
 She bring the sun to shining
 Tell the rain to fall
 
 It's been a long time, mama,
 Since I heard you call my name
 Ah, been a long time
 Since I heard you call my name
 I got to see my Colorado girl again
 
 Be there tomorrow
 Mama, don't you cry
 Be there tomorrow
 Now, mama, don't you cry
 I got to kiss these lonesome
 Texas blues good-bye
 
 I'm goin' out to to Denver
 See if I can't find
 I'm goin' out to to Denver
 See if I can't find
 That lovin' Colorado girl of mine
 That lovin' Colorado girl of mine
 
 Yellow moon, amber light
 Baby, baby, baby, please come home to me
 Another blue and lonesome night
 Baby, baby, baby, please come home to me
 
 I knew I'd cry, when you were gone
 Baby, baby, baby please come home to me
 Thought I'd survive but I was wrong
 Baby, baby, baby, please
 
 Just as soon as you were out that door
 I remembered what my life was like before
 Now nothin's gonna be the same again
 'Cause I'm lonelier than I was then
 And I can't ever let this feelin' go
 'Cause now I know
 
 I stay up late wake up alone
 Aw baby, baby, baby please come home to me
 
 No matter what I say or do
 I know I'll never get over losin' you
 So I'm crossin' my heart and promisin'
 If I get you in my arms again
 I'm not ever gonna let you go
 'Cause now I know
 
 The doors unlocked
 The light is on
 Baby, baby, baby, please come home to me
 Baby, baby, baby, please
 
 Low down, uptown, open every door
 Take on anything together in between the wars
 Can't live without each, can't take it anymore
 Something's gotta give but it never did before
 Sleeping under bridges or on linen sheets of white
 Lazy Sunday morning's, crazy Saturday nights
 Workin' on an angle but we never get it right
 Never givin' up because we might
 
 No matter what you do
 No matter what you say
 I'll come back to you
 Come what may, come what may
 
 North wind, South wind, East wind, West
 Where it's gonna carry us is anybody's guess
 And when we ain't together I don't love you any less
 Standin' by the highway all alone and I'm a mess
 Good times, bad times, nothin' ever lasts
 Better day tomorrow then it's already past
 Lookin' at the bottom and it's coming up fast
 Stoppin' on a dime before we crash
 
 No matter what you do
 No matter what you say
 I'll come back to you
 Come what may, come what may
 
 Anytime at all
 Darkest night or day
 You hear me when I call
 Come what may, come what may
 
 No matter what you do
 No matter what you say
 I'll come back to you
 Come what may, come what may
 
 Anytime at all
 Darkest night or day
 You hear me when I call
 Come what may, come what may
 
 Early this mornin' I was washin' my face 
 Thinkin' '??bout goin' to town 
 Sick and tired of hangin' around this place 
 Waitin' on the blues to track me down 
 Bless my soul maybe I'm comin' around 
 Been lyin' low but maybe I'm comin' around 
 
 I've been runnin' nearly all of my life 
 Far and as fast as I can 
 It may sound funny but I'm thinkin' this might 
 Be about right where I came in 
 Well I don't know maybe I'm comin' around 
 Got a ways to go but maybe I'm comin' around 
 Finally layin' my burden down 
 
 One fine day 
 I'll be free 
 'Til it comes 
 I'll go on 
 
 My heart's a little ragged but it's all that I got 
 So I'm gonna give it a try 
 Ook out world I'm comin' ready or not 
 I don't want to let you pass me by 
 Here I go maybe I'm comin' around 
 I'm a little bit slow but maybe I'm comin' around 
 Finally layin' my burden down
 
 Oh Condi Condi beggin' on my knees 
 Open up your heart and let me in wontcha please 
 Got no money but everybody knows 
 I love you Condi and I'll never let you go 
 Sweet and dandy pretty as can be 
 You be the flower and I'll be the bumble bee 
 Oh she loves me oops she loves me not 
 People say you're cold but I think you're hot 
 
 Oh, Condi, Condi 
 Oh, Condi, Condi 
 
 Oh Condi, Condi I'm talkin' to you girl 
 What's it gonna hurt come on give me a whirl 
 Shake your body now let me see you go 
 One time for me Oh Condi I love you so 
 Skank for me Condi show me what you got 
 They say you're too uptight I say you're not 
 Dance around me spinnin' like a top 
 Oh Condi Condi Condi don't ever stop 
 
 Oh Condi Condi Can't you hear me call 
 I'm standin' in the street outside your garden wall 
 Pocketful of money belly full of wine 
 Condi in my heart and romance on my mind 
 Listen to me Condi don't be afraid 
 I come here tonight to chase your blues away 
 I'll never hurt you I'll treat you right 
 Oh Condaleeza won't you come out tonight 
 
 Pretty little Condi precious as can be 
 Bet you never had another lover like me
 
 What if I told you it was done with mirrors?
 What if I showed you it was all a lie?
 Better be careful someone might hear ya
 The walls have ears and the sky has eyes
 What if I said you were only dreamin'?
 What you wanna bet that all you gotta do
 Is open up your eyes and you will wake up screamin'
 When you realize that it's all come true?
 
 Hush, now, don't you believe it
 Cover your head and close your eyes
 Now, take it or leave it
 Go back to bed now, don't you cry
 
 Half a million soldiers fly across the water
 One in ten are never comin' back again
 Fifty thousand sons who never grew to fathers
 Don't you ever wonder who they might have been
 What if you could've been there on that day in Dallas?
 What if you could wrestle back the hands of time?
 Maybe somehtin' could've been done in Memphis
 We wouldn't be livin' in a dream that's died
 
 Go on and tell yourself again there are no secrets
 Go on and tell yourself that you don't want to know
 It's best that you believe that you don't hear the footsteps
 That follow you around wherever you go
 Maybe you were thinkin' that it didn't matter
 Maybe you believed nobody else would care
 But once you've added every little tile together
 You finally find the truth was always waiting there.
 
 Well, sittin' in the depot long before the break of day 
 I just bought my ticket, Lord I hope the bus ain't late 
 I'll have a cup of coffee and a sandwich from the microwave 
 
 Now I'm gonna see my baby if it's the last thing I ever do 
 Got this sittin' in the station sick and tired of waitin' 
 Continental Trailways blues 
 
 Well rollin' out for Houston, man we're finally rollin' now 
 Try to get some sleep and listen to that highway sound 
 I guess we must have stopped in every single little town 
 Now I've bought myself a copy of the Natchez Mississippi News 
 With the just pulled out of Lake Charles rollin' into sulfur 
 Continental Trailways blues 
 
 Now, we're rollin' into Houston, don't them city lights look fine 
 Headed for the pay phone, hangin' onto my last dime 
 Well, she says she's got a new man, Son, it's been a long, long time 
 
 Now I was standin' by the highway with the rain runnin' through my shoes 
 With the sittin' by the road side wishin' I was inside Continental Trailways blues 
 I got the wishin' I was downtown waitin' on a Greyhound 
 Continental Trailways blues
 
 Well my name's John Lee Pettimore
 Same as my daddy and his daddy before
 You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here
 He only come to town about twice a year
 
 He'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line
 Everybody knew that he made moonshine
 Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
 He headed up the holler with everything he had
 'Fore my time but I've been told
 He never come back from Copperhead Road
 
 Now Daddy ran the whiskey in a big black Dodge
 Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge
 Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side
 Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside
 
 Well him and my uncle tore that engine down
 I still remember that rumblin' sound
 When the sheriff came around in the middle of the night
 Heard mama cryin', knew something wasn't right
 He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
 You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road
 
 I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
 They draft the white trash first,'round here anyway
 I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
 I came home with a brand new plan
 I take the seed from Columbia and Mexico
 I just plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road
 And now the D.E.A.'s got a chopper in the air
 I wake up screaming like I'm back over there
 I learned a thing or two from Charlie don't you know
 You better stay away from Copperhead Road
 
 Copperhead Road
 Copperhead Road
 Copperhead Road
 
 She's a country girl 
 Young and pretty 
 She want to see the world 
 So she headed for the city 
 She was entertained in all the right places 
 Knew half of the names, and all of the faces 
 
 Just a country girl 
 If her daddy could see her now 
 Just a country girl 
 Well you'd never recognize your little angel now 
 She comes down from way South, 
 She talks slow and lazy 
 
 When she opened her mouth the city boys went crazy 
 They fed her pink champagne, give her a headache 
 Cheap cocaine makes her meaner than a rattlesnake 
 Reelin' and a rockin' couldn't get enough 
 Crawlin' when the sun comes up 
 
 And payback's hell 
 There's a bag lady talkin' to her shopping cart 
 Don't you know the scary part 
 Is she saw herself
 
 An elaborate tale
 So convincingly real
 Things can seem so amazing
 'Til you get up close
 And see they're no big deal
 Like the stars in the sky
 Or the one on the stage
 Just a big ball of gas
 And a regular guy
 Fresh out of minimum wage
 
 In a jackalope space
 On a jackalope high
 I'm staring you down
 Creepy jackalope eye
 
 Many things in this life
 Are not what they appear
 Yeah I look like a hare
 But if you stop and you stare
 I'm related to a deer
 
 I got a jackalope face
 I'm a jackalope guy
 And I'm staring you down
 Creepy jackalope eye
 
 Is it so hard to imagine
 Is it so hard to believe
 Something so outrageous
 Something so far fetched
 Well how 'bout Adam and Eve?
 
 I know you gotta have faith
 I know the need to hope
 But the truth is always in place
 It's right in front of my face
 The mighty jackalope
 
 In a jackalope space
 On a jackalope high
 I'm staring you down
 Creepy jackalope
 And I'm staring down
 Creepy jackalope
 And I'm staring you down
 Creepy jackalope eye
 Freaky jackalope eye
 Creepy jackalope eye
 Creepy jackalope eye
 
 I cried so hard
 You know I can't do more
 It's a turn of the card
 It's a close of the door
 The lies you told
 You know they hurt so deep
 So I go home and cry myself to sleep
 
 Day after day
 You been treatin' me bad
 My friends'll come up and say
 Why do you take all of that?
 And it's makin' me moan
 And it's makin' me weep
 So I go home and cry myself to sleep
 
 You play at love like a child plays games
 One day I'm in and then I'm out again
 You change the rules
 I can't win
 You've broken me, now, so I'll give in
 
 You play at love like a child plays games
 One day I'm in and then I'm out again
 You change the rules
 I can't win
 You've broken me, now, so I'll give in
 
 Well, I've been through worse
 But I don't know what
 Joy is just the reverse
 Of what I've got
 So take this heart
 Or what's left to keep
 And I go home and cry myself to sleep
 I just go home and cry myself to sleep
 I go home and cry myself to sleep
 
 Crying, crying, waiting, waiting
 Hoping, hoping you'll come back
 I just can't seem to get you off my mind
 
 Crying, crying, waiting, waiting
 Hoping, hoping you'll come back
 You're the one I love
 I think about you all the time
 
 Crying, crying, doo d-doo doo
 Tears keep a-falling all night long
 Waiting, waiting, doo d-doo doo
 It seems so useless I know it's wrong
 
 To keep on crying, crying, waiting, waiting
 Hoping, hoping you'll come back baby
 Someday soon things will change
 And you'll be mine
 
 Crying, crying, doo d-doo doo
 Tears keep a-falling all night long
 Waiting, waiting, doo d-doo doo
 It seems so useless I know it's wrong
 
 To keep on crying, crying, waiting, waiting
 Hoping, hoping you'll come back
 Maybe someday soon things will change
 And you'll be mine
 
 Crying, crying
 Waiting, waiting
 Hoping, hoping
 
 Darlin' I'm beggin, down on my knees
 Darlin' I'm pleadin, insanity
 You sign the papers, I'll gladly go
 Darlin' commit me, and I can't take it no more
 
 I'd be so happy, and you would be too
 You'd have my money, and I'd have my own room
 Go call the judge girl, lord no need to wait
 Darlin' commit me before it's too late
 And it'd be so peaceful
 It'd be so quiet
 Ain't no clock to punch no time no day no night
 No books about it
 No checks to bounce
 Just four warn, rubled walls and no way out
 
 So I'll lock up my body, set my soul free
 Darlin' commit me and swallow the key
 
 I know you miss me but there's, no need to greave
 You get the parts and the baskets I weave
 I said that I'm dead girl, people talk so they know
 Darlin' commit me and no one will know
 
 Wont have to worry no more girl
 I been looney bin
 Hey play parcheezy, I'll play with my looney friend
 Won't have to comb my hair girl
 I won't have to shave
 I won't have to race the guy next door
 To see who's the first one in his grave
 
 I've been so frantic, with all the psychotic chew
 Darlin' commit me it's the least you can do
 Darlin' commit me it's the least you can do
 
 Another year has come and gone
 Another circle 'round the sun
 Another thousand tears have fallen
 I don't ever count 'em 'cause
 I'm surrounded by your love
 And days are never long enough
 
 Four more seasons on parade
 Show their colors then they fade
 But that won't happen to us, darlin'
 We'll remember how it was
 Then begin again because
 Days are never long enough
 
 Time's never late
 Isn't bound by our fate
 Try as we may
 Love might never be found if we wait
 Until the sun comes up
 On another day my love
 Days are never long enough
 
 Time's never late
 Isn't bound by our fate
 Try as we may
 Love might never be found if we wait
 Until the sun comes up
 On another day my love
 Days are never long enough
 
 Well, when you're sitting there 
 In your silk upholstered chair 
 Talking to some rich folk that you know 
 Well, I hope you won't see me 
 In my ragged company 
 You know I could never be alone 
 
 Take me down, little Susie, take me down 
 I know you think you're the queen of the underground 
 And you can send me dead flowers every morning 
 Send me dead flowers by the mail 
 Send me dead flowers to my wedding 
 And I won't forget to put roses on your grave 
 
 Well, when you're sitting back 
 In your rose pink Cadillac 
 Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day 
 I'll be in my basement room 
 With a needle and a spoon 
 And another girl to take my pain away 
 
 Take me down, little Susie, take me down 
 I know you think you're the queen of the underground 
 And you can send me dead flowers every morning 
 Send me dead flowers by the mail 
 Send me dead flowers to my wedding 
 And I won't forget to put roses on your grave 
 
 Take me down, little Susie, take me down 
 I know you think you're the queen of the underground 
 And you can send me dead flowers every morning 
 Send me dead flowers by the US mail 
 Say it with dead flowers at my wedding 
 And I won't forget to put roses on your grave 
 No, I won't forget to put roses on your grave
 
 Come away with me,
 My little delta boy
 I wanna be your delta mama for awhile
 And if you stay you'll see
 That I bring you lots of joy
 I turn those little teardrops to a smile
 
 Well, if you're blue don't cry
 Just wander right downtown
 You can find your delta mama waitin' there
 Well, I thought you knew that I
 Would never let you down
 I can ease your mind and take away your cares
 
 Come away with me,
 My little delta boy
 I wanna be your delta mama for awhile
 And if you stay you'll see
 That I bring you lots of joy
 I turn those little teardrops to a smile
 
 Well, if the grass goes brown
 Don't you hang your head too low
 Well, there ain't no need for you to sit and pine
 If you'll just ask around
 I'm sure someone will know
 Just exactly what it takes to get you back to feelin fine
 
 Well, if you don't know by now
 What I've been tryin' so hard to say
 Well my delta boy I'm afraid you're up to tight
 But you take it slow and somehow
 You come meandering out my way
 And I'll take you in my arms and make it right
 
 Ah, come away with me,
 My little delta boy
 I wanna be your delta mama for awhile
 And if you stay you'll see
 That I bring you lots of joy
 I turn those little teardrops to a smile
 
 I am Kilrain and I'm a fightin' man
 And I come from County Clare
 And the brits would hang me for a fenian 
 So I took me leave of there
 
 And I crossed the ocean in the "Arrianne"
 The vilest tub afloat
 And the captain's brother was a railroad man and he met us at the boat
 So I joined up with the 20th Maine
 Like I said my friend I'm a fighting man
 And we're marchin' south in the pouring rain
 And we're all goin' down to dixieland
 
 I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine
 And we fight for Chamberlain
 'Cause he stood right with us 
 When the johnnies came like a banshee on the wind
 When the smoke cleared out of Gettysburg many a mother wept
 For many a good boy died there, sure
 And the air smelted just like death
 
 I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine 
 And I'd march to hell and back again
 For colonel Joshua Chamberlain
 We're all goin' down to dixieland
 
 I am Kilrain of the 20th Maine
 And I damn all gentlemen
 Whose only worth is their father's name
 And the sweat of a workin' man
 Well we come from the farms 
 And the city streets and a hundred foreign lands
 And we spilled our blood in the battle's heat
 Now we're all Americans
 
 Don't you take it too bad
 If you're feelin' unlovin'
 If you're feelin unfeelin'
 If you're feelin' alone
 Don't take it too bad
 
 'cause it ain't you to blame, babe
 Lord, it's just some kind of game made
 Out of all of this living
 That we got left to do
 
 And if you go searchin'
 For rhyme or for reason
 Then you won't have the time
 That it take just for talkin'
 About the places you've been, babe
 About the places you've seen, babe
 And how soft the time flies
 Past your window at night
 
 And we just can't have that, girl
 'cause it's a sad, lonesome, cold world
 And a man need a woman just to stand by his side
 And whisper sweet words in his ears about daydreams
 And roses and playthings
 And the sweetness of springtime
 And the sound of the rain
 
 Pale Male the famous redtail hawk performs wingstands
 High above midtown Manhattan
 Circles around for one last pass over the Park
 Got his eye on a fat squirrel down there and a couple of pigeons
 They got no place to run, no place to hide
 
 But Pale Male he's cool, see 'cause his breakfast ain't goin' nowhere
 So he does a loop to loop for the tourists and the six o'clock news
 Got him a penthouse view from the tip-top of the food chain, boys
 He looks up and down Fifth Avenue and says "God I love this town"
 
 But life goes on, down here below
 And all us mortals struggle so
 We laugh and cry
 And live and die
 That's how it goes
 For all we know
 Down here below
 
 I saw Joe Mitchell's ghost on a downtown 'A' train
 He just rides on forever now that the Fulton Fish Market's shut down
 He said 'they ain't never gonna get that smell out of the water
 I don't give a damn how much of that new money they burn'
 
 Now hell's kitchen's Clinton and the Bowery's Nolita
 And the East Village's creepin' 'cross the Williamsburg Bridge
 And hey, whatever happened to Alphabet City?
 Ain't no place left in this town that a poor boy can go
 
 But life goes on, down here below
 And all us mortals struggle so
 We laugh and cry
 And live and die
 That's how it goes
 For all we know
 Down here below
 
 Pale Male swimmin' in the air
 Looks like he's in heaven up there
 People sufferin' everywhere
 But he don't care
 
 But life goes on, down here below
 And all us mortals struggle so
 We laugh and cry
 
 On the blue side of evenin' 
 When the darkness takes control 
 You start lookin' for a reason 
 To take your lonesome on down the road 
 
 'Cause the night is filled with strangers 
 All you need is one, you know 
 If she ain't the one you're after 
 Keep on lookin' on down the road 
 
 Though the miles lay long behind you 
 You have still got miles to go 
 How's love ever gonna find you 
 If it ain't here, it's down the road? 
 
 Though the miles lay long behind you 
 You have still got miles to go 
 How's love ever gonna find you 
 If it ain't here, it's down the road? 
 
 Keep on lookin' on down the road
 
 On the blue side of evenin' 
 When the darkness takes control
 
 Woke up in the mornin' with the middle of nowhere blues
 Nothin' in my pocket but a ticket that I can't use
 Been hangin' around this town and it's startin' to show
 Down the road I go
 
 Standin' on the highway with the road burnin' through my shoes
 Roll over Kerouac and tell Woody Guthrie the news
 Heard it said there ain't nothin' ahead but I don't know
 Down the road I go
 
 Blowin' in the wind and flyin' like a cannonball
 Never seen a city where I couldn't find a place to fall
 But it's only a matter of time before I'm feelin' low
 Down the road I go
 
 Daddy was a Chevy mama was a Cadillac
 I was gone as soon as I was born and I ain't been back
 I'm a rounder and a friend to any old wind that blows
 Down the road I go
 
 Elijah came to Texas 
 To build his family a home 
 With his wife and new baby 
 And what little goods that they owned 
 Had a good yoke of oxen 
 And hand tools for clearing the land 
 And he built him a church 
 'Cause he was a God fearin' man 
 All of his children when there 
 Worshiped here through the years 
 On down to my granddad 
 He's buried 'bout 40 yards from here 
 It's where I was baptized 
 And where I took me a wife 
 And if I have my say so 
 That's where I'll rest when it's time 
 
 When I'm dead and I'm gone 
 Won't you carry me home 
 To that little white church 
 In my daddy's home town 
 
 'Cause Lord knows I'm some kind of sinner 
 But I've done come this far 
 And it's too late for changin' 
 When this race has been run 
 Take me back where I came from 
 And let me return what I took from the ground 
 When this body won't carry me no further 
 Take me back 
 And lay me down 
 This east Texas red dirt 
 Won't grow much of nothin' they say 
 'Cept tomatoes and peaches 
 They mostly drill for oil nowadays 
 And a hired hand named Regan 
 First made me understand 
 And he told me the red was the blood of my kin in the land
 
 I was fresh out of the service
 It was back in 82
 I raised some Cain when I come back to town
 I left to be all I could be
 Come home without a clue
 Now, I married Dawn and had to settle down
 
 So I hired on at the prison
 Guess I always knew I would
 Just like my dad and both my uncles done
 And I worked on every cell block
 Now, things're goin' good
 But then they transferred me to Ellis Unit One
 
 Swing low
 Swing low
 Swing low and carry me home
 
 Well, my daddy used to talk about them long nights at the walls
 And how they used to strap em in the chair
 The kids down from the college and they'd bring their beer n all
 N when the lights went out, a cheer rose in the air
 
 Well, folks just got too civilized
 Sparky's gatherin' dust
 Cause no one wants to touch a smokin' gun
 And since they got the injection
 They don't mind as much, I guess
 They just put em down at Ellis Unit One
 
 Swing low
 Swing low
 Swing low and carry me home
 
 Well, I've seen em fight like lions, boys
 I've seen 'em go like lambs
 And I've helped to drag em when they could not stand
 And I've heard their mamas cryin' when they heard that big door slam
 And I've seen the victim's family holdin' hands
 
 Last night I dreamed that I woke up with straps across my chest
 And something cold and black pullin' through my lungs
 N even Jesus couldn't save me though I know he did his best
 But he don't live on Ellis Unit One
 
 Swing low
 Swing low
 Swing low and carry me home
 Swing low
 Don't let go
 Swing low and carry me home
 
 Nights fall hard on Hollywood 
 The stars don't come out like they should 
 Up above the world so high tonight 
 They can't outshine the neon lights 
 Now the golden days are gone for good 
 In Esmeralda's Hollywood 
 
 She comes out when the sun is gone 
 But she don't have to walk alone 
 Cause once the darkness takes this town 
 She ain't the only ghost around 
 Waitin' by the public phone 
 
 If it don't ring she heads back home 
 Esmeralda, Esmeralda girl, what are you waitin' for 
 Esmeralda, Esmeralda, can't hang around this place no more 
 Searchlights rip the L.A. sky 
 When you look in Esmeralda's eyes 
 The people come from miles around 
 To see the kings and queens they crowned 
 Behind the barricades they stood 
 In Esmeralda's Hollywood 
 
 Aw, wait until the sun goes down 
 Listen for the lonely sound 
 Esmeralda's hanging round 
 No one shed a tear that day 
 When Esmeralda passed away 
 
 All up and down the strip they say 
 It was just like any other day 
 The evil struggled with the good 
 Down in Esmeralda's Hollywood
 
 I've always heard that love is blind 
 But I know that there's another kind 
 Shines like a beacon in the night 
 And holds up in the morning light 
 
 'Cause in my dreams she travels with me when I run 
 And in my dreams she takes my hand 
 When I make my stand but the morning always comes 
 I know it's too good to be true 
 She loves me even when I'm blue 
 
 No one can say that I ain't tried 
 I keep on searching far and wide 
 'Cause I know she's out there somewhere now 
 I'm gonna track her down somehow
 
 'Cause in my dreams she travels with me when I run 
 And in my dreams she takes my hand 
 When I make my stand but the morning always comes 
 I know it's too good to be true 
 She loves me even when I'm blue 
 
 'Cause in my dreams she travels with me when I run 
 And in my dreams she takes my hand 
 When I make my stand but the morning always comes 
 And I know she's looking for me too 
 She loves me even when I'm blue 
 She loves me even when I'm blue
 
 I love you with all my heart
 All my soul and every part of me
 It's all I can do to mark
 Where you end and where I start you see
 I've labored long in my travails 
 And left a trail of tears behind me
 Been in love so many times
 Didn't think this kind would ever find me
 
 I love you with everything
 All my weakness all my strength and
 I can't promise anything 
 Except that my last breath will bear your name
 And when I'm gone they'll sing a song
 About a lonely fool who wandered
 Around the world and back again
 But in the end he finally found her
 And I love you with all my heart
 All my soul and every part of me
 
 Across the universe I'll spin 
 Until the end and then I wonder
 If we should get another chance
 Could I have that dance forever under
 Double moon and scarlet stars 
 Shining down on where you are
 And I'll love you with all my heart
 All my soul and every part of me
 
 Everyone's in love with You 
 Everyone's in love with you 
 But you don't seem to mind 
 But it must be tough when you're cleanin' up 
 Them broken hearts sometimes 
 Or maybe you just struggle through 
 And leave 'em where they lie 
 But everyone's in love with you 
 In love with you 
 
 Everyone's in love with you 
 They fall down at your feet 
 And impale themselves knowin' full well 
 You'll only watch 'em bleed 
 And they won't stop 'til the final drop 
 Cause they think it's what you need 
 And everyone's in love 
 In love with you 
 
 You want everyone to want you 
 But you don't want anyone to need you 
 Cause baby you don't need to 
 
 Everyone's in love with you 
 Or don't you think I know 
 The way they all light up when you show up 
 And you're baskin' in the glow 
 I'd like to say that I ain't that way 
 Like all your other fools 
 But everyone's in love with you 
 And I am, too 
 I am, too
 
 I used to listen to the radio
 And I don't guess
 They're listenin' to me no more
 They talk too much but that's okay
 I don't understand a single word they say
 Piss and moan about the immigrants
 But don'??t say nothin' about the president
 A democracy don't work that way
 I can say anything I wanna say
 
 So fuck the FCC
 Fuck the FBI
 Fuck the CIA
 Livin' in the motherfuckin' USA
 
 People tell me that I'm paranoid
 And I admit I'm gettin'
 Pretty nervous, boy
 It just gets tougher everyday
 To sit around and watch it
 While it slips away
 Been called a traitor and a patriot
 Call me anything you want to but
 Just don't forget your history
 Dirty Lenny died so we could all be free
 
 Don't you worry bout what you've been told
 Cause honey I ain't even close to cold
 It's kinda soon to fall in love again
 But sometimes the best that you can do is just jump back in
 I got me a fearless heart
 Strong enough to get you through the scary part
 It's been broken many times before
 A fearless heart just comes back for more
 
 Folks'll tell you that I'm just no good
 But I wouldn't hurt you honey if I could
 I can't promise this'll work out right
 But it would kill me darlin' if we didn't even try
 
 I admit I fall in love a lot
 But I nearly always give it my best shot
 I know you must think I'm the reckless kind
 But I want a lady with a fearless heart just like mine
 
 I was born my papa's son
 A wanderin' eye and a smokin' gun
 Now some of you would live through me
 And lock me up and throw away the key
 Or just find a place to hide away
 Hope that I'll just go away, huh
 
 I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
 I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
 
 I'll bring you precious contraband
 And ancient tales from distant lands
 Of conquerors and concubines and
 Conjurers from darker times
 Betrayal and conspiracy
 Sacrilege and heresy
 
 Well I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
 I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
 
 I got every thing you want or need
 Your darkest fear, your fondest dream
 I ask you questions, tell you lies
 Criticize and sympathize
 Yeah but, be careful what you wish for friend
 'Cause I've been to hell and now I'm back again
 
 I feel alright, yeah I feel alright tonight
 Yeah I feel alright, I feel alright tonight
 Feel alright, feel alright
 
 I'm fixin' to die, reckon I'm going to Hell
 I'm fixin' to die, reckon I'm going to Hell
 I'd be tellin' you a lie, if I told you I was treatin' her well
 
 Now I followed her car to the Heaven on the Highway Hotel
 I followed her car to the Heaven on the Highway Hotel
 I'm fixin' to die, reckon I'm going to Hell
 
 Sittin' in the shadow across the parking lot
 Reckon that I'm probably right, prayin' that I'm not
 A pistol on the dashboard, whiskey in the cup
 Here he come, let 'em get inside and I lit 'em up
 
 Fixin' to die, reckon I'm going to Hell
 I'm fixin' to die, reckon I'm going to Hell
 'Cause I shot my baby in the Heaven on the Highway Hotel
 And I'm fixin' to die, going to Hell
 I'm fixin' to die, and I'm going to Hell
 I'm fixin' to die, reckon I'm going to Hell
 
 Warden walkin' up ahead, preacher there behind
 Guard on either side in case my legs unwind
 Chains around my ankles, beads around my hands
 Walking 'cross the yard never coming back again
 
 I'm fixin' to die, reckon I'm going to Hell
 I'm fixin' to die, reckon I'm going to Hell
 'Cause I shot my baby in the Heaven on the Highway Hotel
 Now I'm fixin' to die, I'm going to Hell
 I'm fixin' to die, I'm going to Hell
 I'm fixin' to die, reckon I'm going to Hell
 
 For better or worse that's what the man said
 And I still can't get those words out of my head
 And they come back to haunt me like some ancient curse
 But it's just me to blame, for better or worse
 
 For richer or poorer, in sickness and health
 This is the poorest that's I've ever felt
 Darlin' we made a promise and I broke it first
 Now it's me and this heartache for better or worse
 
 I could say I don't love you, but my heart know the truth
 And it won't let me get away with hurting you
 But it's knowing I've lost you forever that hurts
 Now it's me and your memory for better or worse
 
 For richer or poorer, in sickness and health
 This is the poorest that's I've ever felt
 Darlin' we made a promise and I broke it first
 Now it's me and this heartache for better or worse
 
 In Ft. Worth all the neon's burnin' bright
 Pretty lights, red and blue
 But they'd shut down all the honky tonks tonight
 Say a prayer or two
 If they only knew
 
 You used to say the highway was your home
 But we both know, that ain't true
 It's just the only place a man can go
 When he don't know, where he's travelin' to
 
 But Colorado's always clean and healin'
 And Tennessee in spring is green and cool
 It never really was your kind of town
 But you went around, with the Ft. Worth blues
 
 Somewhere up beyond the great divide
 Where the sky is wide and the clouds are few
 A man can see his way clear to the light
 Just hold on tight
 That's all you gotta do
 
 And they say Texas weather's always changin'
 And one thing change'll bring is somethin' new
 And Houston really ain't that bad a town
 So you hang around with the Ft. Worth blues
 
 There's a full moon over Galway Bay tonight
 Silver light, over green and blue
 And every place I travel through I find
 Some kinda sign, that you've been through
 
 But Amsterdam was always good for grieving
 And London never fails to leave me blue
 And Paris never was my kinda town
 So I walked around with the Ft. Worth blues
 
 Papa don't shoot no dice papa don't play no cards
 Papa don't shoot no dice he don't play no cards he say the money's tight
 He say the times are hard
 
 Caught me comin' in one night after the clock struck three
 Caught me comin' in last night after the clock struck three you been gamblin'
 You'll be the death of me
 
 Gambled in Mexico gambled in New Orleans
 Gambled in Mexico down in New Orleans played in every game
 In every town between
 
 But a gambler ain't got no friends whenever his luck is down
 Gambler ain't got no friends when his luck is down but when he's ridin' high
 They all hang around
 
  
 Take your red dress, leave the hanger 
 Lose the sadness, use the anger 
 You might need it 'fore you get there 
 
  
 Oh, Amanda 
 You don't have to say goodbye 
 You just go Amanda 
 Ain't no way you didn't try 
 Wo, oh 
 All right 
 
 Tell your sister, tell your brother 
 Take a picture to your mother 
 You've been livin' undercover 
 
 Oh, Amanda 
 Oh, Amanda
 
 Go go boots are back and I think that's outasite
 The kids don't call 'em that but they're go go boots all right
 I was just a little boy the first time they come around
 But my sister had her some and she wore 'em up town
 And she did the dirty dog and the boogaloo all night
 Go go boots are back and I think that's outasite
 
 Lava lamps were fun but I never wanted one
 'Cause I had a little psychedelic thing of my own
 Is it really any wonder that I never finished school
 'Cause I'm wanderin' the hallways and I'm grinnin' like a fool
 And I never needed any kinda artificial light
 But go go boots are back and I think it's outasite
 
 Wrap yourself around me like a circle 'round the sun
 Take me up the country where the crimson waters run
 'Cause the road goes on forever and a circle never ends
 Everything that goes around comes back around and then
 
 Mirror shades are in and I'm wearin' 'em again
 They keep the mornin' out and the mystery in
 Quick - tell me if my eyes are brown or if they're blue
 'Cause when you look inside all you're gonna see is you
 But you'll know where I'm goin' and where you been all right
 And go go boots are back and I think it's outasite
 
 I believe in prophecy.
 Some folks see things not everybody can see.
 And, once in a while, they pass the secret along to you and me.
 And I believe in miracles.
 Something sacred burning in every bush and tree.
 We can all learn to sing the songs the angels sing.
 Yeah, I believe in God, and God ain't me.
 
 I've traveled around the world,
 Stood on mighty mountains and gazed across the wilderness.
 Never seen a line in the sand or a diamond in the dust.
 And as our fate unfurls,
 Every day that passes I'm sure about a little bit less.
 Even my money keeps telling me it's God I need to trust.
 And I believe in God, but God ain't us.
 
 God, of my little understanding, don't care what name I call.
 Whether or not I believe doesn't matter at all.
 I receive the blessin's.
 And every day on Earth's another chance to get it right.
 Let this little light of mine shine and rage against the night.
 Just another lesson
 Maybe someone's watching and wondering what I got.
 Maybe this is why I'm here on Earth, and maybe not.
 But I believe in God, and God is God.
 
 I got a job but it ain't nearly enough 
 A twenty thousand dollar pickup truck 
 Belongs to me and the bank and some funny talkin' man from Iran 
 I left the service and got a G.I. loan 
 I got married bought myself a home 
 Now I hang around this one horse town and do the best than I can 
 
 It's gettin' tough 
 Just my luck 
 I was born in the land of plenty now there ain't enough 
 Gettin' cold 
 I've been told 
 Nowadays it just don't pay to be a good ol' boy 
 
 Been goin' nowhere down a one-way track 
 I'd kill to leave it but ain't no turnin' back 
 Got the wife and the kids and what would everybody say 
 My brother's standin' on a welfare line 
 And any minute now I might get mine 
 Meanwhile it's the I.R.S. and the devil to pay 
 
 Gettin' tough 
 Just my luck 
 I was born in the land of plenty now there ain't enough 
 Gettin' cold 
 I've been told 
 Nowadays it just don't pay to be a good ol' boy 
 
 I hit the beer joints every Friday night 
 Spend a little money lookin' for a fight 
 It don't matter if I lose or win 
 'Cause Monday I'm back on the losin' end again
 
 Gettin' tough 
 It's just my luck 
 I was born in the land of plenty now there ain't enough 
 It's gettin' cold 
 I've been told 
 Nowadays it just don't pay to be a good ol' boy 
 
 Gettin' tough 
 Just my luck 
 I was born in the land of plenty now there ain't enough 
 Gettin' cold 
 I've been told 
 Nowadays it just don't pay to be a good ol' boy
 
 I remember holdin' on to you,
 All them long and lonely nights I put you through
 Somewhere in there, I'm sure I made you cry,
 But I can't remember if we said goodbye
 
 But I recall, all of them nights down in Mexico
 One place I may never go in my life again
 Was I just off somewhere or just too high?
 But I can't remember if we said goodbye
 
 I only miss you every now and then, 
 Like the soft breeze blowin' up from the Caribbean
 Most Novembers I break down and cry,
 But I can't remember if we said goodbye
 
 But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico,
 That's one place I'll never go in my life again
 Awh was I just off somewhere or just too high?
 But I can't remember if we said goodbye
 No I can't remember if we said goodbye
 Goodbye
 Goodbye
 
 Goodbye Michelangelo
 Ain't no trouble where you go
 Ain't no pain to burn you blind
 Just enough to draw a line
 
 Goodbye maestro, fare thee well
 Gone to heaven, been to hell
 Maybe just New Mexico
 Goodbye Michelangelo
 
 So long my captain, adios
 Sail upon the sea of ghosts
 Chase the white whale to the end
 Bring the story back again
 
 I'm bound to follow you some day
 You have always shown the way
 So we knew where we had to go
 Goodbye Michelangelo
 
 Oh, Susanna don't you cry
 He'll find you by and by
 Just like you did before
 This ain't forever
 
 Is this goodbye 'till it comes my time?
 I won't have to travel blind
 Cause you taught me everything I know
 Goodbye Michelangelo
 
 Could tell it when I woke up this mornin' 
 'Cause I can smell it when a heartache's comin' 
 Not that I'm in such a hurry to lose you 
 I'd call you up but there's nothin' that I can do 
 Talkin' won't do any good anyway 
 'Cause goodbye's all we've got left to say 
 I don't think that it'll get any better 
 So maybe you could just write me a letter 
 And I could open it up when I'm stronger 
 Another ten or twelve years, maybe longer 
 Guess I just don't feel much like bad news today 
 Goodbye's all we've got left to say 
 
 Don't try to call me 'cause I'm takin' my phone out 
 'Cause if it rings, I'll know what it's about 
 And don't you worry 'bout me 'cause I'm alright 
 Maybe you'll run into me somewhere, some night 
 And if you do just keep goin' your way 
 Goodbye's all we've got left to say
 
 Hey pretty baby are you ready for me
 Yeah it's your good rockin' daddy down from Tennessee
 I'm just out of Austin bound for San Antone
 With the radio blastin' and the bird dog on
 
 There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town
 But no local yokel gonna shut me down
 'Cause me and my boys got this rig unwound
 And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town
 
 Nothin' ever happened 'round my hometown
 And I ain't the kind to just hang around
 But I heard someone callin' my name one day
 And I followed that voice down the lost highway
 
 Everybody told me you can't get far
 On thirty-seven dollars and a Jap guitar
 Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down
 And a rockin' little combo from the Guitar Town
 
 Hey pretty baby don't you know it ain't my fault
 I love to hear the steel belts hummin' on the asphalt
 Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop
 Stumble in the restaurant wonderin' why I don't stop
 
 Well I gotta keep rockin' while I still can
 I gotta two pack habit and a motel tan
 When my boots hit the boards I'm a brand new man
 With my back to the riser I make my stand
 
 And hey pretty baby won't you hold me tight
 I'm loadin' up and rollin' out of here tonight
 One of these days I'm gonna settle down
 And take you back with me to the Guitar Town
 
 
 Everybody wants to be happy and free
 Like the fish out in the ocean, the bird up in the tree
 The teacher and the preacher and the president and me
 Just wanna be happy and free
 
 If you make a million dollars you're gonna want three
 Climb the highest mountain, somewhere else you wanna be
 Doesn't matter any minor miracle you see
 Never make you happy and free
 
 Somedays
 Got your good eye on the prize
 Wake up in the mornin' and you know it was a lie
 Some say
 Even if you try
 You're never gonna catch that ring
 
 Mama always told me I could do most anything
 'Cept for walk upon the water
 Come on in out of the rain
 I'll do unto you how I want you to do to me
 Maybe we'll be happy and free
 
 Sometimes
 There's a blessin' you can see
 The sunset on the water
 And the baby on your knee
 But you'll find
 That everything you need
 You're carryin' around inside
 
 Everybody wants to be happy and free
 The king and queen of Sweden and the aborigine
 Travel 'round the world in search of treasure but the key
 You gotta be happy and free
 
 Girl, don't bother in lockin' door
 He's out there hollering, "Darlin' don't you love me no more?"
 You always let him in before, now didn't you
 
 He's just singin' the same old song
 That he always sang before
 He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
 
 Now girl, better figure out which is which
 Wherefore art thou Romeo you son of a bitch
 You'd just as soon fight as switch, now wouldn't you
 
 He come and make love on your satin sheets
 Wake up on your livin' room floor
 He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
 
 And now he's the last of the all night, do right
 Stand beneath your window 'til daylight
 He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
 Baby, what you waitin' for, alright
 
 Girl, figure out what you're gonna do
 When he moves on again and he leaves you alone and blue
 But you knew he is just passin' through, now didn't you
 
 And now you can't just say this is the last time baby
 Like you always did before
 He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
 
 And now he's the last of the all night, do right
 Stand beneath your window 'til daylight
 He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
 Baby, what you waitin' for
 
 He's the last of the all night, do right
 Hey Rosalita won't you come out tonight
 He's the last of the hard-core troubadours
 
 I'm a Harlan Man 
 Went down in the mine when I was barely grown 
 It was easy then 
 Cause I didn't know what I know now 
 
 But I'm a family man 
 And it's the only life that I've ever known 
 But I'm a Harlan Man 
 Just as long as my luck and lungs hold out 
 
 I'm a mountain man 
 Born in east Kentucky and here I'll stay 
 And if it's the good Lord's plan 
 I'll wake up in the mornin' and find 
 
 I'm lookin' at the end 
 Of another long week and I can draw my pay 
 Cause I'm a Harlan Man 
 Never catch me whinin' cause I ain't that kind 
 
 I'm a union man 
 Just like my daddy and all my kin 
 I took a union stand 
 No matter what the company said 
 
 I got me two good hands 
 And just as long as I'm able I won't give in 
 Cause I'm a Harlan Man 
 A coal minin' mother til the day I'm dead
 
 He was standin' on the corner 
 A hundred dollar bill in his hand 
 Said I could feed a lot of these people with this 
 But that ain't the business at hand 
 Ain't but one reason for a white boy to be 
 Over on this side of town 
 He gave that money to the man and he 
 Bought a little mercy for now 
 Have mercy on me 
 Have mercy on me 
 I'm a sinner Lord can't you see 
 Have mercy on me 
 
 Old Joe don't know how it got started 
 I guess it was the fire in her eyes 
 He loved his wife and children 
 And he wasn't into telling all these lies 
 But she gave herself so freely 
 In that room at the top of the stairs 
 He'd go to her in hope he'd find a little mercy there 
 
 Tears were made to fall 
 Hearts made to break 
 Sometimes it feels 
 Like they just want to know 
 How much you can take 
 She was all alone that evening 
 What was she thinking about 
 Her mind was made up and 
 I guess it was the only way out 
 There's a pistol in a pawn shop window 
 Made of cold, blue steel 
 She took it home to find out 
 How warm a little mercy could feel 
 God knows that mercy ain't free 
 Have mercy on me
 
 Don't need no radio weatherman
 Telling me the mercury's out of hand
 Heat waves shimmer off a blacktop street
 You better keep moving or you'll burn your feet
 Something about the sun when it's beating down
 Makes a young man's head start spinning around
 And an old man smiles 'cause he knows this town's heatin' up
 Heatin' up, heatin' up
 
 Girls in their cars on the drag downtown
 Radio up and the ragtop down 
 Pool hall boys all drop their cues
 Running outside 'cause they're feeling it too 
 Well the sweat starts rollin' in little hot drops
 From cut-off jeans and the halter tops
 And it's started now, and it ain't gonna stop heatin' up
 Heatin' up
 
 Well the sun is sinking, but it's too late now
 The juke joint crowd just can't cool down
 Dance floor's shaking from a heavy beat
 The steam cloud rising, when the bodies meet 
 
 Some are gonna love, and some are gonna fight
 As a hell fire burns through the summer night
 And it starts all over in the morning light heatin' up
 Heatin' up, heatin' up
 
 I'm rolling down a blacktop highway
 hole in my chest 'cause my heart's in your hand
 I know it ain't okay but I can't stop wantin' you I do the best that I can
 I'm starin' in a highbeam headlight
 Burnin' your name on the back of my brain
 I swear I hear you callin' I might have to turn around 'cause I'm goin' insane
 
 I love you baby but I just can't tell
 This kinda of love comes from Heaven or Hell
 Heaven or Hell
 Heaven or Hell
 
 New moon against a long dark midnight blue
 Ain't a star any brighter than you
 I look in your eyes and see that spark inside and it's all I can do
 To keep tellin' myself there ain't no way
 You're gonna do me like you did then
 I'm standin' my ground on feet of clay
 Oh no here I go again
 
 There ain't nothin' nobody can say
 There ain't nothin' nobody can do
 Get down on my knees and pray
 Oooh
 
 I love you baby but I just can't tell
 This kinda of love comes from Heaven or Hell
 Heaven or Hell
 Heaven or Hell
 
 I love you baby but I just can't tell
 I love you baby but I just can't tell
 
 Here I am
 On my way
 Down another road I have paved
 With every good intention I've saved
 And hearts that I broke
 As for me I got scars
 For every mile I've traveled so far
 And some blood on my hands
 Here I am
 
 With a song in my heart
 And an attitude from the start
 I took everybody apart
 To see how they work
 I got friends that I owe
 I ain't namin' names
 'Cause they know where they stand
 Here I am
 
 Here I am
 Here I am
 Here I am
 
 If I went back where I've been
 And I knew what I know now then
 Well I'd probably do it again
 'Cause I'm just a man
 At the end of the day
 I ain't got nothing to say
 
 Here I am
 Here I am
 Here I am
 
 Here I am
 Here I am
 Here I am
 
 My granddaddy was a miner, but he finally saw the light 
 He didn't have much, just a beat-up truck and a dream about a better life 
 Grand mama cried when she waved goodbye, never heard such a lonesome sound 
 Pretty soon the dirt road turned into blacktop, Detroit City bound 
 Down that hillbilly highway 
 On that hillbilly highway 
 That old hillbilly highway 
 Goes on and on 
 
 Now he worked and saved his money so that one day he might send 
 My old man off to college, to use his brains and not his hands 
 Grand mama cried when she waved goodbye, never heard such a lonesome sound 
 But daddy had himself a good job in Houston, one more rollin' down 
 
 that old hillbilly highway 
 That old hillbilly highway 
 That old hillbilly highway 
 Goes on and on 
 On and on, on and on 
 Here it goes
 
 Granddaddy rolled over in his grave the day that I quit school 
 I just sat around the house playin' my guitar, Daddy said I was a fool 
 My mama cried when I said goodbye, I never heard such a lonesome sound 
 Now I'm standin' on this highway and if you're going my way 
 You know where I'm bound
 
 Bound that hillbilly highway 
 On that hillbilly highway 
 That old hillbilly highway 
 Goes on and on 
 Hmm, yeah that's the road I'm on it
 
 Hillbilly highway 
 Hillbilly highway
 
 Don't understand why I don't love you
 No one could ask for a heart more true
 Sometimes I think I was born this blue
 I should have know from the start
 
 Now I got a hold in my heart
 I seem to be missing a part
 I put the pieces together again
 But this hole in my heart won't mend
 
 I was in love once long ago
 I tried my best not to let it show
 But she was the kind that'll always know
 That's the kind that'll tear you apart
 
 Now I got a hold in my heart
 I seem to be missing a part
 I put the pieces together again
 But this hole in my heart won't mend
 
 I'd be a fool to let you go
 Tell me something that I don't know
 She got the roses and the warm red wine
 You got the thorns and these blues of mine
 I got a rainbow I'll never find
 I'm stumbling around in the dark
 
 Now I got a hold in my heart
 I seem to be missing a part
 I put the pieces together again
 But this hole in my heart won't mend
 
 Now I got a hold in my heart
 I seem to be missing a part
 I put the pieces together again
 But this hole in my heart won't mend
 
 When I pulled out of Basra they all wished me luck
 Just like they always did before
 With a bulletproof screen on the hood of my truck
 And a Bradley on my back door
 And I wound her up and shifted her down
 And I offered this prayer to my lord
 I said "God get me back home to Houston alive
 And I won't drive a truck anymore"
 
 Early in the mornin' and I'm rollin' fast
 Haulin' nine thousand gallons of high test gas
 Sergeant on the radio hollerin' at me
 Look out up ahead here come a R.P.G.
 If I ever get home to Houston alive
 Then I won't drive a truck anymore
 
 I've driven the big rigs for all of my life
 And my radio handle's "Train"
 Down steep mountain roads on the darkest of nights
 I had ice water in my veins
 And I come over here 'cause I just didn't care
 Now I'm older and wiser by far
 If I ever get home to Houston alive
 Then I won't drive a truck anymore
 
 Great God A'mighty what was wrong with me
 I know the money's good but buddy can't you see
 You can't take it with you and that ain't no lie
 I don't wanna let 'em get me I'm too young to die
 If I ever get home to Houston alive
 Then I won't drive a truck anymore
 
 I wish I'd never come back home 
 It don't feel right since I've been grown 
 I can't find any of my old friends hangin' 'round 
 Won't nothin' bring you down like your hometown 
 
 I spent some time in New Orleans 
 I had to live on rice and beans 
 I hitched through Texas when the sun was beatin' down 
 Won't nothin' bring you down like your hometown 
 
 Home is where the heart is 
 Ain't that what they always say 
 My heart lies in broken pieces 
 Scattered along the way 
 
 So don't think about me when I'm gone 
 I don't mind travelin' alone 
 You are the sweetest little thing that I ever found 
 But won't nothin' bring you down like your hometown
 Alright Wilson pick it
 
 Yeh home is where the heart is 
 Ain't that what they always say 
 My heart lies in broken pieces 
 Scattered along the way
 
 So don't think about me when I'm gone 
 I don't mind travelin' alone 
 Hey you are the sweetest little thing that I ever found 
 But won't nothin' bring you down like your hometown 
 Ah sugar, won't nothin' bring you down like your hometown
 
 You can love most of the people
 Most of the time
 Now and again, if you're lookin' I'm sure
 You will find
 
 Someone who's helplessly hoping
 That someday they'll finally find the one
 Hopeless romantics keep hoping that
 Someday will come
 
 Used to be you, could be sure
 That a warrior was true
 Nowadays everyone knows that it's cool to be blue
 Constantly circling close to the flame
 
 And then stopping on a dime
 Hopeless romantics will go down in flames every time
 Hopeless romantics drop everything and run
 When they find a broken heart
 
 Always afraid that they're missing someone
 With time on their hands and a missing part
 So one of these nights
 When you're sitting at home all alone
 
 And you've finally admitted you're lonely
 Right down to the bone
 You might as well get on out in it
 'Cause you've got everything to lose
 
 And hopeless romantics are always
 At home with the blues and a broken heart
 Find the missing part
 Hopeless romantics are usually hopelessly true
 
 You always got your deep freeze on
 You think you got me fooled
 I've been around enough to know
 No one could be that cool
 
 Is it hot enough for ya
 Can you feel it now
 You're a cool one, aren't you
 I'm gonna melt you down
 I always knew I'd get to you somehow
 Hot enough for ya
 Can you feel it now
 You want to freeze me don't ya
 I'm gonna melt you down
 I always knew I'd get to you somehow
 
 You tell yourself I'm cooling down
 You think you got me beat
 I got you where I want you now
 So I'll just keep on turning up the heat
 
 Is it hot enough for ya
 Can you feel it now
 You're a cool one, aren't you
 I'm gonna melt you down
 I always knew I'd get to you somehow
 Hot enough for ya
 Can you feel it now
 You want to freeze me don't ya
 I'm gonna melt you down
 I always knew I'd get to you somehow
 
 Here I am, out in the rain
 I know I can't ever wash out the pain
 I never meant to be cruel or untrue
 But I'm just hurtin' me when I'm hurtin' you
 
 Girl I won't say, I'm hurtin' more
 I know that you've heard all that before
 So go on believe what you wanna believe
 But I'm hurtin' you then I'm hurtin' me
 
 I know it's hard to keep hangin' on
 You think that I hold all of the cards, I know you're wrong
 
 And girl just like me, you ain't got a clue
 I'm just hurtin' me when I'm hurtin' you
 
 You know I love you baby, God only knows that I do
 I know I've been bad baby
 I never, ever meant to be bad to you
 I never meant to be cruel or untrue
 But I'm just hurtin' me when I'm hurtin' you
 
 I know it's hard to keep hangin' on
 When you think that I hold all of the cards, I know you're wrong
 
 And girl just like me, you ain't got a clue
 I'm just hurtin' me when I'm hurtin' you
 I'm hurtin' me when I'm hurtin' you
 
 I was born by the railroad tracks 
 Well the train whistle wailed and I wailed right back 
 Well papa left mama when I was quite young 
 He said now "One of these days you're gonna follow me son" 
 Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 I ain't ever satisfied 
 Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 I ain't ever satisfied 
 Now I had me a woman she was my world 
 But I ran off with my back street girl 
 Now my back street woman could not be true 
 She left me standin' on the boulevard thinkin' bout you 
 I got an empty feeling deep inside 
 I'm going over to the other side 
 Last night I dreamed I made it to the promise land 
 I was standin' at the gate and I had the key in my hand 
 Saint Peter said "Come on in boy, you're finally home" 
 I said "No thanks Pete, I'll just be moving along"
 
 I am a wanderer feet on the ground
 Heart on my sleeve and my head in the clouds
 Eye on a star above some distant shore
 Wandering ever more
 
 I am a refugee torn from my land
 Cast off to travel this world to its end
 Never to see my proud mountains again
 But I still remember them
 
 I am a laborer sign round my neck, 
 "Will work for dignity, trust and respect"
 Stand on this corner so you don't forget
 I haven't had mine yet
 
 I am a prisoner pacing my cell
 Three steps and back in my corner of hell
 Lock me away and you swallow the key
 Some day I shall be free
 
 And I'll be a wanderer feet on the ground
 Heart on my sleeve and my head in the clouds
 Eye on a star above some distant shore
 Wandering ever more
 
 In the blink of an eye 
 Stars'll fall from the sky 
 No one even notices 
 If you think it'll help 
 I can walk out myself 
 And we won't have to go through this 
 If I pretend to hold you tight 
 And out on the highway late some night 
 That's all right 
 If that's all that it takes 
 Even if my heart breaks 
 Darlin' I can wait 
 
 I have nothin' but time 
 And this poor heart of mine 
 Probably could use some rest 
 When the ghosts are all gone 
 You can leave your light on 
 Shinin' through the loneliness 
 Just like a beacon in the night 
 Brighter than any star in sight 
 But that's all right 
 For as long as it takes 
 For that mornin' to break 
 Darlin' I can wait 
 
 Out where the mountains meet the sky 
 Feelin' so lonesome I could cry 
 But that's all right 
 Cause all the signs say 
 You'll call me someday 
 Darlin' I can wait
 
 Baby it's a cold hard world out there 
 Broken hearted people everywhere 
 Takin' whatever love they get 
 I don't want to wind up like that, so 
 
 Baby throw your arms around my neck 
 Lay your pretty head against my chest 
 Listen to one heartbeat then the next 
 Cause baby I don't want to lose you yet 
 
 You know I love you and I know you love me 
 It's everything that love's supposed to be 
 But I don't want to look up one day 
 And find out we let it slip away 
 
 Can't tell you nothin' 'bout love I guess 
 That you don't already know 
 But girl, when you're in my arms like this 
 I don't ever want to let you go 
 
 Baby maybe I'm wrong but what it I'm right 
 And everything's depending on us tonight 
 Maybe we'll pass this way again 
 But honey I don't want to wait 'til then, so 
 
 I was born my papa's son
 A wanderin' eye and a smokin' gun
 Now some of you would live through me
 Lock me up and throw away the key
 Or just find a place to hide away
 Hope that I'll just go away
 I feel alright I feel alright tonight
 
 I'll bring you precious contraband
 And ancient tales from distant lands
 Of conquerors and concubines and
 Conjurers from darker times
 Betrayal and conspiracy
 Sacrilege and heresy
 
 I got every thing you won't or need
 Your darkest fear, your fondest dream
 I ask you questions, tell you lies
 Criticize and sympathize
 Be careful what you wish for friend
 Because I've been to hell and now I'm back again
 
 Ooh pretty baby what you doin' to me 
 The way your kisses burn right through me 
 I don't think I can last much longer 
 I get weaker and my love gets stronger 
 I don't think that my heart can take it 
 One little slip of a word might break it 
 Well believe me baby this ain't no crush 
 I think maybe I love you too much 
 
 Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby, baby, I love you too much 
 Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby, baby, I love you too much 
 
 I tell myself that it ain't no big thing 
 Then you give another little tug on that heart string 
 Well you cut me girl and I'm still bleedin' 
 Well just touch me baby, that's all I'm needin' 
 You must think that I'm easy, don't ya 
 But I got scars that I've never shown ya 
 Well every inch of me burns for your touch 
 I think maybe I love you too much
 
 When I'm walkin' these streets
 And I'm countin' my steps
 And I'm draggin' my feet
 Cause I ain't ready yet
 To start all over again
 Cause every time that I do
 I remember you
 
 Well you broke my heart
 And it healed alright
 Now we're far apart
 And I don't lie awake at night
 But every once in a while
 Right out of the blue
 I remember you
 
 Well, you never write, and I never call
 And I don't miss you tonight, I'm just curios that's all
 Do you still have dreams? Did they all come true?
 Does it every seem like you'll never make it through?
 And do you ever miss me the way that I do
 When I remember you?
 
 Sweetheart last night I dreamed of you
 You loved me like you used to do
 Mornin' come and I woke up and found
 I still carry you around
 
 I still carry you around
 Everywhere I travel now
 No matter how I try to put you down
 I still carry you around
 
 I still just can't believe you're gone
 Your memory haunts me from now on
 I walk the streets of this old lonely town
 I still carry you around
 
 I still carry you around
 Everywhere I travel now
 No matter how I try to put you down
 I still carry you around
 
 You're with me everywhere I go
 In my heart and in my soul
 Down every road, no matter where I'm bound
 I still carry you around
 
 I still carry you around
 Everywhere I travel now
 No matter how I try to put you down
 I still carry you around
 
 I been watchin' you watchin' me
 I could feel your eyes from way across the room
 But now that I'm holdin' you close I can see
 Ain't no way I'm gonna get around you
 I won't tell you I don't need you tonight
 I won't pretend I ain't burnin' inside
 Your skin glowin' soft in the silver moonlight
 The shadows where the promises hide
 The bittersweet taste of your kiss
 It's all more than I can resist
 
 If you're thinkin' '??bout breakin' my heart
 You might as well just pick up your little black dress and go
 Somebody else already tore it apart
 And I thought you should know
 
 Maybe this is all that you want
 Maybe you're just as lonesome as me
 A shoulder that you can cry on
 A warm safe place you can be
 Someone to call in the middle of the night
 When the ghosts in your bedroom won't rest
 Two arms to hold you tight
 I promise that I'll do my best
 To give you everything I got to give
 And keep your secrets for as long as I live
 
 I won't be your next in line
 If you don't love me, don't waste my time
 Hearts break easy but you won't break mine
 I won't be your next in line
 
 You got a reputation
 That follows you 'round
 It's the same old situation
 You're tryin' to live it down
 You left a line of lovers
 Everywhere you've been
 But I'm not like the others
 So you better look again
 
 I won't be your next in line
 If you don't love me, don't waste my time
 Hearts break easy but you won't break mine
 I won't be your next in line
 
 If you're looking for a fool girl
 You may as well move on
 'Cause I've been watchin' you girl
 A lot longer than you know
 I could see it comin'
 Like a freight train down the line
 And you won't see me runnin'
 'Cause I'm not the runnin' kind
 
 I won't be your next in line
 If you don't love me, don't waste my time
 Hearts break easy but you won't break mine
 I won't be your next in line
 
 I won't be your next in line
 If you don't love me, don't waste my time
 Hearts break easy but you won't break mine
 I won't be your next in line
 
 I'm looking through you,
 Where did you go?
 I thought I knew you,
 What did I know?
 You don't look different, but you have changed
 I'm looking through you, you're not the same
 
 Your lips are moving,
 I cannot hear
 Your voice is soothing,
 But the words aren't clear
 You don't sound different,
 I've learned the game
 I'm looking through you,
 You're not the same
 
 Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
 Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
 
 You're thinking of me,
 The same old way
 You were above me,
 But not today
 The only difference is you're down there
 I'm looking through you,
 And you're nowhere
 
 Yeh why, tell me why did you not treat me right?
 Well love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
 
 I'm looking through you,
 Where did you go?
 I thought I knew you,
 What did I know?
 You don't look different,
 But you have changed
 I'm looking through you,
 You're not the same!
 
 Baby you've changed
 I'm lookin' through you
 Yeah, I'm lookin' through you
 
 Seems like I've been here before
 Just outside some closing door
 Standing here just searching for a lie
 You'd think by now I'd have it down
 I know I should be wiser now
 Cause no one's gonna bail me out this time
 I'm not gettin' any better at goodbyes
 
 I'm not any better now than when I first began
 It hurts every bit as much as it did way back then
 I suppose I'll cry a lot
 The only thing for sure is, I'm not gettin' any better at goodbyes
 
 Friends may come and friends may go
 But lovers memories die so slow
 And they won't always let you know it's time
 But even this shall pass, I guess
 You'll be just like all the rest
 I'll start dusting off all my best lies
 I'm not gettin' any better at goodbyes
 
 I'm not any better now than when I first began
 It hurts every bit as much as it did way back then
 I suppose I'll cry a lot
 The only thing for sure is, I'm not gettin' any better at goodbyes
 
 I didn't know 
 You'd be in this place tonight 
 Then again I thought you might 
 Now I don't know what to do 
 Does it show 
 When my poor heart skips a beat 
 Each and every time we meet 
 'Cause I'm still in love with you 
 
 There you are 
 Right across the room from me 
 Just the way I knew you'd be 
 Lookin' lonesome wild and blue 
 I'm alright so far 
 Just as long as you don't speak 
 That's what makes my knees go weak 
 'Cause I'm still in love with you 
 
 I've done everything I know 
 To get you off my mind 
 But sometimes I can't help but hope 
 That you won't walk away this time 
 
 Then I wouldn't have to watch you go 
 Wouldn't have to miss you so 
 'Cause I'm still in love with you 
 
 If I knew what I know now 
 I'd never let you leave 
 I'd make it up to you somehow 
 And darlin' you'd come back to me 
 
 Then I wouldn't have to watch you go 
 Wouldn't have to miss you so 
 'Cause I'm still in love with you 
 I wouldn't need to be so blue 
 Wouldn't want you like I do 
 'Cause I'm still in love with you
 
 I didn't know 
 You'd be in this place tonight 
 Then again I thought you might 
 Now I don't know what to do 
 Does it show 
 When my poor heart skips a beat 
 Each and every time we meet 
 'Cause I'm still in love with you 
 
 There you are 
 Right across the room from me 
 Just the way I knew you'd be 
 Lookin' lonesome wild and blue 
 I'm alright so far 
 Just as long as you don't speak 
 That's what makes my knees go weak 
 'Cause I'm still in love with you 
 
 I've done everything I know 
 To get you off my mind 
 But sometimes I can't help but hope 
 That you won't walk away this time 
 
 Then I wouldn't have to watch you go 
 Wouldn't have to miss you so 
 'Cause I'm still in love with you 
 
 If I knew what I know now 
 I'd never let you leave 
 I'd make it up to you somehow 
 And darlin' you'd come back to me 
 
 Then I wouldn't have to watch you go 
 Wouldn't have to miss you so 
 'Cause I'm still in love with you 
 I wouldn't need to be so blue 
 Wouldn't want you like I do 
 'Cause I'm still in love with you
 
 If my mama coulda seen me in this prison, she'd cry but she can't
 She'd wanna know if I was learnin' my lesson, I'd lie but I ain't
 She could never tell the difference 'cause I listen with my mouth
 So send me up the river and I'm never gettin' out
 If my mama coulda seen me in this prison, she'd cry but she can't
 
 If my mama coulda seen me in these chains, she'd be fit to be tired
 She would spare that pain 'cause I was barely thirteen when she died
 Well, I reckon she's in Heaven and I know that I'm in Hell
 Nobody is a-prayin' in a solitary cell
 If my mama coulda seen me in this prison, she'd cry but she can't
 
 Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief
 Ain't nobody ever causing mama any grief
 First time, never mind, third shock out
 You're a-climbin' on the boogie beyond a shadow of a doubt
 
 If my mama coulda seen me in this prison, it'd brake her poor heart
 Took her dreams and damned if I didn't tear everyone apart
 Now I get down on my knees nearly every single day
 Thank the Lord she never have to see me this way
 If my mama coulda seen me in this prison, she'd cry but she can't
 If my mama coulda seen me in this prison, she'd cry but she can't
 
 I saw you lookin' at that girl like that
 Yeah I saw her too boy I know right where you're at
 But you better be careful
 'Cause she ain't the kind you're gonna forget
 How much you want to bet
 
 If you fall in love
 Nothin' gonna be the same
 You walk around callin' out her name
 You throw your heart down like a glove
 Push come to shove
 You only end up lonely and blue
 Whenever she's away from you
 If you fall in love
 
 You gotta hear me talkin' to ya
 'Cause I'm your best friend
 And I'd hate to see you goin'
 Where I've already been
 'Cause I've been in love before
 And I won't ever be the same again
 You better listen to me, Jim
 
 If you fall in love
 Nothin' gonna be the same
 You walk around callin' out her name
 You throw your heart down like a glove
 Push come to shove
 You only end up lonely and blue
 Whenever she's away from you
 If you fall in love
 
 There she is again
 She sure looks fine
 Boy, I know you're walkin'
 On a very thin line
 So I guess it's up to me
 'Cause your heart's not as strong as mine
 Well just this one time
 
 If you fall in love
 Nothin' gonna be the same
 You walk around callin' out her name
 Throw your heart down like a glove
 Push come to shove
 You only end up lonely and blue
 Whenever she's away from you
 If you fall in love
 If you fall in love
 If you fall in love
 
 Darlin', I could tell we're through 
 That leavin' look's all over you 
 I'll be waitin' here no matter what you do 
 Call me if you need a fool 
 
 Go and find another guy 
 And if he don't believe your lies 
 You know there's someone who'll swear every word is true 
 Call me if you need a fool 
 
 They're just not makin' fools the way that they used to 
 They don't come back for more the way I always do 
 So if you ever change your mind 
 I'm not very hard to find 
 You can find me in the phone book under ";Blue"; 
 Call me if you need a fool 
 
 They're just not makin' fools the way that they used to 
 They don't come back for more the way I always do 
 So if you ever change your mind 
 I'm not very hard to find 
 You can find me in the phone book under ";Blue"; 
 Call me if you need a fool 
 Call me if you need a fool 
 
 Girl, it won't cost you a dime 
 To break my heart just one last time 
 Call collect and I'll just tell 'em ";put her through"; 
 Call me if you need a fool
 
 I had a friend named Campbell
 He used to rob, steal, and gamble
 He tried everything that was low down
 He was out tomcattin' one night
 When he started a big fight
 And a big policeman came and knocked him down
 
 He's in the jailhouse now 
 He's in the jailhouse now 
 I told him over again
 Quit drinkin' whiskey, they all found gin
 He's in the jailhouse now
 
 Now Cambell broke jail one day
 Decided he'd go away
 Police met him at the train
 The cop says I've come for you
 Cambell says this won't do
 'Cause you know Cambell's never been my name
 
 He's in the jailhouse now 
 He's in the jailhouse now 
 Yeah, he broke out
 All over town, the fool walked about
 He's in the jailhouse now
 
 Now, Cambell had a gal named Sadie
 Sadie said where's my baby
 I told her he was downtown in the can
 She went down to the jail
 It was just to go his bail
 And she said I come down here to get my man
 
 She's in the jailhouse now 
 She's in the jailhouse now 
 Now you understand
 Why Ol' Sadie's in the can
 She's in the jailhouse now
 
 She's in the jailhouse now
 
 There's a hole in my shoe but I don't mind
 'Cause it keeps me connected to the ground when I'm
 Feelin' like maybe if I ain't careful I'll just blow away
 Then the lightnin' strikes, the thunder rolls and I'm okay
 
 Everywhere I go
 People pass me by
 They never know 'cause I'm invisible
 A shadow hangin' low
 A footstep just behind
 They carry on but I'm invisible
 
 I'm taking my time but I ain't slow
 'Cause it ain't like I got anyplace else to go
 But there's ghosts in these streets and they're callin' my name
 And I follow 'em down in the dark again
 
 An angel bendin' down
 To whisper in your ear
 You turn around but we're invisible
 
 A rumble underground
 Your deepest darkest fear
 You hear the sound but they're invisible
 
 Brother can you spare
 A dollar and a dime?
 The cupboard's bare and I'm invisible
 Travel anywhere
 You won't ever find
 A purer heart 'cause mine's invisible
 I'm invisible
 
 No matter which way the wind blows 
 It's always cold when you're alone 
 Ain't no candle in the window 
 You've got to find your own way home 
 
 The rain ain't gonna hurt you 
 It's come to wash away your blues 
 It's all up to you 
 
 No one said it would be easy 
 But it don't have to be this hard 
 If you're lookin' for a reason 
 
 Just stand right where you are 
 Now there ain't no one out to get you 
 They've got to walk in their own shoes 
 
 It's all up to you 
 No one else can get you through 
 Right or wrong, win or lose 
 It's all up to you 
 
 You can stand out on that highway 
 Look as far as you can see 
 But when you get to that horizon 
 There's always someplace else to be 
 
 But don't you stop to look behind you 
 'Cause you've got some travelin' left to do 
 It's all up to you
 
 I was walkin'
 Walkin' down the Jericho road
 And every mile that I traveled showed
 And I'm walkin' down the Jericho road
 I just kept walkin'
 Walkin' down the Jericho road
 And the sun set red over fields of gold
 And I'm walkin' down the Jericho road
 Well Joshua fit the battle, that's how the story goes
 And the walls come a-tumb-a-lin' down I know
 But I'm still walkin'
 Walkin' down the Jericho road
 
 I met my mother walkin' down the Jericho road
 Tears in her eyes and her head hung low
 And she was walkin' down the Jericho road
 I met my father walkin' down the Jericho road
 His back bent over from a heavy load
 And he was walkin' down the Jericho road
 I said "Papa, don't you know me? Won't you lay your burden down?"
 He just shook his head and told me "Son, you better turn around"
 And he kept on walkin'
 Walkin' down the Jericho road
 
 I met my brother walkin' down the Jericho road
 And his hands were bloody but his face was clean
 And he was walkin' down the Jericho road
 I met my sister walkin' down the Jericho road
 With a babe in her arms that I'd never seen
 And she was walkin' down the Jericho road
 She said "It's just a little orphan child I found along the way
 I'll raise him as my own and he'll forgive us all someday"
 And she kept on walkin'
 Walkin' down the Jericho road
 
 I met my mother
 I met my father
 I met my brother
 I met my sister
 
 I woke up this morning, and none of the news was good
 Death machines were rumblin' 'cross the ground where Jesus stood
 And the man on my TV told me that it had always been that way
 And there was nothing anyone could do or say
 
 And I almost listened to him
 Yeah, I almost lost my mind
 And I regained my senses again
 Looked into my heart to find
 
 That I believe that one fine day all the children of Abraham
 Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem
 
 Well maybe I'm only dreamin' and maybe I'm just a fool
 But I don't remember learnin' how to hate in Sunday school
 Somewhere along the way I strayed and I never looked back again
 But I still find some comfort now and then
 
 Then the storm comes rumblin' in
 And I can't lay me down
 And the drums are drummin' again
 And I can't stand the sound
 
 But I believe there'll come a day when the lion and the lamb
 Will lie down in peace together in Jerusalem
 
 And there'll be no barricades then
 There'll be no wire or walls
 And we can wash all this blood from our hands
 And all this hatred from our souls
 
 And I believe that on that day all the children of Abraham
 Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem
 
 I'm just an American boy, raised on MTV 
 And I've seen all the kids in the soda pop ads 
 But none of 'em look like me. 
 So I started lookin' around for a light out of the dim 
 And the first thing I heard that made sense was the word 
 Of Mohammed, peace be upon him 
 
 A shadu la ilaha illa Allah 
 There is no God but God 
 
 If my daddy could see me now '?? chains around my feet 
 He don't understand that sometimes a man's 
 Got to fight for what he believes 
 And I believe God is great, all praise due to him 
 And if I should die, I'll rise up to the sky 
 Just like Jesus, peace be upon him 
 
 We came to fight the Jihad, and our hearts were pure and strong. 
 As death filled the air, we all offered up prayers 
 And prepared for our martyrdom. 
 But Allah had some other plan, some secret not revealed 
 Now they're draggin' me back with my head in a sack 
 To the land of the infidel. 
 
 A shadu la ilaha illa Allah 
 A shadu la ilaha illa Allah
 
 I'm an American, boys, I've come a long way
 I was born and bred in the USA
 So listen up close, I've got something to say
 Boys, I'm buying this round
 
 Well it took a little while, but we're in this fight
 Ain't going home 'til we've done what's right
 We're gonna drink Camden Town dry tonight
 If I have to spend my last pound
 
 When I first got to London it was pourin' down rain
 Met a little girl in the field canteen
 Painted her name on the nose of my plane
 Six more missions, I'm gone
 
 Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might
 Then the warden came around yelling "shut out the lights"
 Death rainin' out of the London night
 We made love 'til dawn
 
 But when Johnny come lately comes marching home
 His chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
 They'll be waitin' at the station down in San Antone
 When Johnny comes marching home
 
 My P-47 is a pretty good ship
 And she took a round comin' cross the Channel last trip
 I was thinkin' 'bout my baby and letting her rip
 Always got me through so far
 
 Well they can ship me all over this great big world
 I've never find nothing like my North End girl
 I'm taking her home with me one day, sir
 Soon as we win this war
 
 But when Johnny come lately comes marching home
 Chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
 They'll be waitin' at the station down in San Antone
 When Johnny comes marching home, Johnny
 
 Now my grandaddy sang this song
 Told me about London when the Blitz was on
 How he married grandma and brought her back home
 A hero throughout his land
 
 Now I'm standing on a runway in San Diego
 A couple Purple Hearts and move a little slow
 There's nobody here, maybe nobody knows
 About a place called Vietnam
 
 But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home
 With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
 They'll be waitin' at the station down in San Antone
 When Johnny comes marching home
 
 Now when Johnny come lately comes marching home
 Chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
 They'll be waitin' at the station down in San Antone
 When Johnny comes marching home, Johnny
 
 Walkin' down the road with a pistol in your waist
 Johnny Too Bad, woh oh oh
 Walkin' down the road with a ratchet in your waist
 Johnny Too Bad, woh oh oh
 
 You're just robbin' and stabbin' and lootin' and shootin'
 Johnny Too Bad
 You're just robbin' and stabbin' and lootin' and shootin'
 Johnny Too Bad
 
 One of these days when you hear the voice say 'come'
 Where you gonna run to, woh oh oh
 One of these days when you hear the voice say 'come'
 Where you gonna run to, woh oh oh
 
 You're just runnin' to the rock for refuge
 But there will be no rock
 You're just runnin' to the rock for rescue
 And there will be no rock
 
 Oh you who hail from Ontario 
 Know the tale of the Donnelly's Oh 
 Died at the hands of a mob that night 
 Every child and man by the oil torch light 
 Jim Donnelly was no angel sure 
 But they burned his barn, broke down the door 
 Well the children cried while they killed old Jim 
 Then they killed his wife, then they turned on them 
 No judge, no jury, no hangman, no justice in Ontario 
 A hundred years or more have turned 
 And you always hear how much we've learned 
 Well a man lay dead in a Port Hope bar 
 And the blood ran red on a hardwood floor 
 And the big men ran through the nearest door 
 Only one man knew what had happened for sure 
 Well one and all wore the outlaws' brand 
 And the big bikes roared through the Great Northland 
 When you live on the edge of the law 
 You know, justice in Ontario 
 Blue smoke still hung in the air 
 No one spoke when the cops got there 
 Well the local constable made the call 
 Send us Corporal Terry Hall 
 They all sang a different tune 
 When Corporal Hall walked in the room 
 With his picture book and a list of names 
 One by one the witnesses came 
 And they told him what he wanted to know 
 Justice in Ontario 
 The provincial cops searched far and wide 
 And the outlaws ran but they could not hide 
 And they brought em in every single one 
 Save the man who actually fired the gun 
 It was down in London, they were tried 
 And the guilty man stood free outside 
 When he took the stand to pay his debt 
 The judge was blind and the jury deaf 
 In Kingston Town they're locked up still 
 When the sun goes down and the air is chill 
 You could swear you heard Jim Donnelly's ghost cry 
 "Justice In Ontario"
 
 The day I was born the moon crossed the sun mama cried sweet Jesus what have I done lord have mercy on my unfortunate son before I drew my second breath mama knew
 She'd just given birth to the king of the blues
 
 And on that day somewhere somebody else died alone in a dark room and nobody cried
 'Cause there can only be one and I can't be denied outriders told everybody the news
 The king is dead long live the king of the blues
 
 I'm the king of the blues thirteenth of the line the first of my name and the last of my kind
 One foot in the grave and one hand on the handle of time descended directly from St. John the conqueror
 I'm the high priest of heartache and the king of the blues
 
 I'm a lover a fighter a prophet a fool
 The keeper of confidences the lord of misrule
 A consummate jack-of-all-trades of the Dickensian school but they ain't never made no love I couldn't lose
 I'm the last word in lonesome and the king of the blues
 
 Leroy was a farmer and an honest man 
 Would have lived in Oklahoma all his days 
 He just wanted left alone to work a piece of land 
 But a hard wind come and blew his dreams away 
 So he headed for the West Coast thought he could not lose 
 Rollin' down the highway with the dust bowl blues 
 
 It's a thousand miles from Broken Bow to Bakersfield 
 And the highway's paved with heartaches all the way 
 Leroy drove on lookin' for a better deal 
 A place a man could settle down and stay 
 But the police at the state line beat him black and blue 
 Left him lyin' by the roadside with the dust bowl blues 
 
 They say California is a paradise 
 Hollywood turns night time into day 
 But up along the San Joaquin those city lights 
 Might as well be a million miles away 
 When your kids are cold and hungry wearin' worn out shoes 
 Standin' in the garden with the dust bowl blues
 
 Hey little emperor come down from your throne
 The hour glass is empty your time has come and gone
 The battlements are crumblin' the walls are tumblin' down
 Your counselors and concubines are getting' outta town
 Some say it's an omen some say it's the winds of change
 Which ever way it's goin' it's blowin' like a hurricane
 
 Hey little conqueror where you gonna go
 The world is even smaller than it was when you left home
 Emptiness in front of you and detritus behind
 Nobody ever told you that history was kind
 Standin' on the corner your fortune blowin' in the wind
 Daddy didn't warn you there ain't no goin' home again
 
 No pomp and circumstance no more shock and awe
 Your just a little emperor that's all
 
 Hey little hypocrite what you gonna say
 When you wind up standin' naked on the final judgement day
 How you gonna justify it who you gonna call
 What if it turns out that God don't look like you at all
 The leaves are in the teacup the hieroglyphics on the wall
 You ain't the first to rise up you sure won't be the last to fall
 
 Hey little emperor come down from you throne
 And let another emperor climb on
 
 Hey little guy, I can't believe you answered the phone 
 I guess I didn't know you could do that
 Lord help me, have I been gone that long 
 Now, I'm in a truck stop somewhere on the Arkansas line 
 They got all the big trucks here, boy
 You ought to hear the big diesels whine 
 No, little guy, your daddy won't be home for a while 
 It's gonna be another couple weeks and another couple thousand miles 
 
 So go to sleep, little rock 'n' roller 
 Your daddy's up there knockin' 'em dead tonight 
 One of these days when you're a little older 
 You can ride the big bus and everything will be alright 
 Till that day you got your mama to hold you 
 Don't be afraid when she turns out the light 
 'Cause I know there's an angel just for rock 'n' rollers 
 Watchin' over you and your daddy tonight 
 
 No, little guy, don't bother your mamma right now 
 I only got a minute and I called to talk to you anyhow 
 I know you miss me, God knows I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
 I got your picture in my wallet, it cheers me up sometimes when I'm blue 
 Well little guy, I'm gonna have to let you go 
 You know it's way past your bedtime, and they're tellin' me we gotta roll
 
 And so, go to sleep, little rock 'n' roller 
 Your daddy's up there knockin' 'em dead tonight 
 One of these days when you're a little older 
 You can ride the big bus and everything will be alright 
 Till that day you got your mama to hold you 
 Don't be afraid when she turns out the light 
 'Cause I know there's an angel just for rock 'n' rollers 
 Watchin' out for you and your daddy tonight 
 
 I know there's an angel just for rock 'n' rollers 
 Just watchin' over you and your daddy tonight 
 
 Go to sleep, little rock 'n' roller
 Go to sleep, little rock 'n' roller
 Go to sleep, little rock 'n' roller
 Go to sleep, little rock 'n' roller
 
 I don't care what you do to me 
 I don't care what you do to me 
 I don't care what you do to me 
 But won't you let my little sister be 
 Now you can tie me up an torture me 
 You can hang me from a willow tree 
 You can jail me for eternity 
 But won't you let my little sister be 
 She's afraid of the dark 
 She prays for the morning light 
 She's as free as a bird 
 And her wings are spread and ready for flight 
 She knows nothing at all 
 About you and your emotional plight 
 But she heard you making noises 
 In the hallway late last night 
 If you got to have something to show 
 And you've got to take it down below 
 And you're sure that one of us must go 
 Take me and leave my sister alone
 
 The lights go out each evening at eleven
 And up and down our block there's not a sound
 I close my eyes and search for peaceful slumber
 And just then the local memory comes around
 Piles of blues against the door
 To make sure sleep will come no more
 He's the hardest working memory in this town
 Turns out happiness again
 And then lets loneliness back in
 And each night the local memory comes around
 
 Each day I say tonight I may escape him
 I pretend I'm happy and never even a frown
 But at night I close my eyes and pray sleep finds me
 But again the local memory comes around
 Rids the house of all good news
 Then sets out my crying shoes
 What a faithful memory never lets me down
 We're both up till light of day
 Chasing happiness away
 And each night the local memory comes around
 And each night the local memory comes around
 
 It doesn't get any lonelier than this 
 I believe my heart'll break 
 Tonight I prayed I'd die before I wake 
 With every breath I'm tastin' your kiss 
 And it's sweet upon my tongue 
 Until the bitter tears fall one by one 
 
 It doesn't get any lonelier than this 
 Cause I'm on this road alone 
 My heartbeat ringin' like a hollow drum 
 I'm about as lonesome as a poor boy gets 
 And there's nothin' I can do 
 Cause it's dark out here and I can't find you 
 It doesn't get any lonelier than this 
 
 It doesn't get any lonelier than this 
 I'm as blue as blue can be 
 Just an empty place where your love should be 
 I'm sick and tired of walkin' around like this 
 With my heart outside my skin 
 Scared to death we'll never touch again 
 It doesn't get any lonelier than this 
 And there's no place I can go 
 Just the dusty corners that the shadows know 
 Maybe this is as good as it's gonna get 
 And I'll always be this way 
 I'll just wander this world callin' out your name 
 It doesn't get any lonelier than this
 
 Lonely are the free
 There ain't that many of them they don't walk like you and me
 They just tumble in the breeze
 Lighter than a feather altogether separately
 That's how it's s'posed to be
 No matter where they wander
 From post to in between,
 From here to over yonder,
 There's no place for them to lean
 Lonely are the free
 
 The silent are the strong
 Not so much as a whisper tells you anything is wrong
 You've known all along
 But you can't help but listen and now the moment's gone
 Keeps you hangin' on
 Until the silence signalin'
 The breakin' of the dawn
 Is shattered by the sirens singin'
 Sacrificial songs
 Silent are the strong
 
 That's all there is to see
 A violent shadow passin'
 Cross the sun so fleetingly
 That if you have to ask 
 You miss it anyway you see
 Lonely are the free
 
 Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
 Til I outrun your memory 
 I can't go home cause I can't face another day alone 
 Now that you're gone this ain't no place for me 
 I want to start all over new 
 But I can't lose these lonesome highway blues 
 Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
 Til I outrun your memory 
 
 Bound down that long, lonesome highway just as fast as I can fly 
 Just want to go to someplace you won't be 
 I'm movin' on to a new place and hold my head up high 
 Where no one knows what you done to me 
 A thousand miles between us now 
 And still some how 
 These blues'll track me down 
 Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
 Til I outrun your memory 
 
 I'm bound down that long lonesome highway cause it's the only place I know 
 Where there ain't no clouds hangin' over me 
 Leave me alone cause it's a long way no matter where I go 
 Nothin' but blues as far as I can see 
 I wish I had you back again 
 But I know I can't 
 So here I go again 
 Down that long, lonesome highway just as far as I can go 
 Til I outrun your memory
 
 Early in the mornin' I'm out of my bed
 Hangover ringing like a hammer in my head
 But I can't rest, no matter what I do
 'Cause I'm lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 
 Well, I've been uptown, downtown too
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 East coast, West coast, Timbuktu
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 Heartbreak Hotel, Blue Bayou
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 Just can't shake these lovesick blues
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 
 Thought about Melissa, and I thought about Sue
 Thought about Sissy but she meaner than you
 Couldn't imagine, Lana, Caroline or Rose will never do
 'Cause I'm lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 
 Well, I've been uptown, downtown too
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 East coast, West coast, Timbuktu
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 Heartbreak Hotel, Blue Bayou
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 Just can't shake these lovesick blues
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 
 Yeah, I've been uptown, downtown too
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 East coast, West coast, Timbuktu
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 Heartbreak Hotel, Blue Bayou
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 Just can't shake these lovesick blues
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 
 Lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 I'm lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 I'm lookin' for a woman, won't do me like you
 
 Loretta she's my barroom girl
 Wheres them seven's on her sleeve
 Dances like a diamond shines,
 Tells me lies I love to believe
 Her age is always twenty two
 Her laughing eyes a hazel hue
 Spends my money like a water falls
 Loves me like I want her too.
 
 Loretta won't you say to me
 Darlin' put your guitar on
 Have a little shot of booze
 Play a blue and wailin' song
 My guitar rings a melody
 My guitar sings Loretta fine
 Long and lazy wild and free
 And I can have her any time
 
 Sweetest at the break of day
 Prettiest in the setting sun
 She don't cry when I can't stay
 Atleast not 'till she's all alone
 Loretta I won't be gone long
 Keep your dancing slippers on
 Keep me on your mind a while
 I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
 
 I'm stranded
 Standin' in the pourin' rain
 Really comin' down but someday
 Love's gonna blow my way
 Empty-handed
 Haven't got a shuck to pay
 For a ticket outta town but someday
 Love's gonna blow my way
 People goin' places pass me by
 I don't care 'cause I know I
 Got plans made
 And I don't need to do a thing
 But stand right where I am 'cause someday
 Love's gonna blow my way
 
 I've been prayin'
 Light a candle everyday
 And every little prayer that I pray
 Says love's gonna blow my way
 So I'm just stayin'
 Waitin' on the wind to change
 'Cause generally all the signs say
 Love's gonna blow my way
 Stormy weather never brings me down
 'Cause it don't ever hang around
 It just fades
 Into another sunny day
 Shinin' down on me 'cause someday
 Love's gonna blow my way
 
 I ain't goin' nowhere I can't be
 Where my true love can't follow me
 So I'll wait
 Takes forever that's okay
 'Cause somethin' in the air says someday
 Love's gonna blow my way
 
 
 I stood in line and left my name
 Took about six hours or so
 Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
 Said they'd let me know
 I put in my time till the pocono line
 Shut down two years ago
 I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
 Now I can't stay there no more
 
 Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
 To move some old cars around
 Maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out
 Van and do a little settlin' down
 Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
 And the junkyard's a pretty good ways
 That job's about a half week old besides
 It'd be gone now anyway
 
 Unemployment said I got no more checks
 And they showed me to the hall
 My brother died in Georgia some time ago
 I got no one left to call
 Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
 A little short on food that's all
 Now I gotta get marie some kind of coat
 We're headed down into fall
 
 I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
 Hustled up a little dough
 But I got drunk and I woke up rolled
 A couple of months ago
 They got my harp and they got my dollar
 
 Them low life so and so's
 Harps cost money and I ain't got it
 It's my own fault I suppose
 
 The pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
 Two freights everyday
 If it was just me I'd be headed south
 But Marie can't catch no train
 She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
 Says we gotta wait and see
 In my heart I know it's a little boy
 Hope he don't end up like me
 
 Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
 I gotta stand in line again
 I want to kill him but I just say no
 I had enough of that line my friend
 I head back to the bridge, it's getting kinda cold
 I'm feelin' too low down to lie
 I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
 Hope she don't break down and cry
 
 Marie she didn't wake up this morning
 She didn't even try
 She just rolled over and went to heaven
 My little boy safe inside
 I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
 Caught a Chesapeake on the fly
 Marie will know I'm headed south
 So's to meet me by and by
 
 Marie will know I'm headed south
 So to meet me by and by
 
 The eagle looked down on the river below
 And he wrapped his wings round him
 And he felt like a stone
 And the big salmon fought but the talons held true
 
 And he shuttered as the world turned
 From silver to blue
 I stood there in awe though I'd seen it before
 I was born in these mountains 
 
 And I'll die here for sure
 I've traveled around I've seen city lights
 But nothin' that shined like a big sky at night
 
 Some mornings will find me up above the timberline
 Lonesome don't seem like much once you're this high
 When it's all said and done I usually find
 Me and the eagle are of the same mind
 
 Now when I was young I took me a wife
 But she never took to the high country life
 So now I'm alone I don't really mind
 But her name echoes down form the canyon sometimes
 
 In my dreams there's a horse,
 He stands eighteen hands high
 He's as whit as the snow and there's fire in his eyes
 And he'll bare only me though other have tried
 
 And together we'll travel up across the divide
 
 I had a melancholy malady
 Wen to see the doctor and the doctor say
 Too bad nothin' he could do he
 Knew a man in Louisiana if I'm willin' to pay
 Laid my money on the barrelhead
 Man behind the bar began to shimmy and shake
 Can't lie I reckoned I was dead
 When he picked up my money up and I heard him say
 
 Meet me in the alleyway
 Minute to midnight don't be late
 Meet me in the alleyway
 Better come runnin' the spirits won't wait
 
 Thirteen tiger teeth in my talisman
 St. John The Conqueror and a black cat bone
 Been seen walkin' with the Guardians
 Now I'm in the alley and I'm all alone
 Can't run can't hide from destiny
 Knew this day was comin' nearly all of my life
 Been done ain't the only boy from Tennessee
 To carve his name in cypress with a jawbone knife
 
 Meet me in the alleyway
 Minute to midnight don't be late
 Meet me in the alleyway
 Better come runnin' the spirits won't wait
 
 So you wanna be the king of America
 Say you wanna know the oracle's mind
 Say you wanna see the Marquessess of Mardi Gras
 Dancin' with the devil at the end of the line
 
 Meet me in the alleyway
 Minute to midnight don't be late
 Meet me in the alleyway
 Better come runnin' the spirits won't wait
 
 Meet me in the alleyway
 Don't be late
 Meet me in the alleyway
 Better come runnin' the spirits won't wait
 
 Me and ol' Bill there we both come from Georgia 
 Met Hank out in New Mexico 
 We're bound for Duranqo to join Pancho Villa 
 We hear that he's payin' in gold 
 
 I guess a man's got to do what he's best at 
 Ain't found nothin' better so far 
 Been called mercenaries and men with no country 
 Just soldiers in search of a war 
 
 And we're bound for the border 
 We're soldiers of fortune 
 And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
 Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
 Or the peso down Mexico way 
 
 When this war is over might go back to Georgia 
 And settle down quiet some where 
 I'll most likely pack up and head south for Chile 
 Heard tell of some trouble down there
 
 And we're bound for the border 
 We're soldiers of fortune 
 And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
 Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
 Or the peso down Mexico way 
 
 And we're bound for the border 
 We're soldiers of fortune 
 And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
 Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
 Or the peso down Mexico way 
 
 And we're bound for the border 
 We're soldiers of fortune 
 And we'll fight for no country but we'll die for good pay 
 Under the flag of of the greenback dollar 
 Or the peso down Mexico way
 
 In the shadow of the chestnut tree I hide
 Sword and pistol by my side
 Long come a traveller lay him low
 All for the love of my Molly-O
 
 I left my family I left my home
 Out in the wicked world to roam
 No road so low I won't go
 Down for the love of my Molly-O
 
 Oh Molly
 Oh Molly
 Oh Molly
 All for the love of my Molly-O
 
 I love Molly Gold only knows
 Molly loves diamonds pearls and gold
 Bangles beads and bells I bring
 But Molly won't wear no wedding ring
 
 Men have dies for lesser things
 Vengeance, country, God and King
 Someday I'll swing from the gallows pole
 A final dance for my Molly-O
 
 I'm trying hard to let you go
 But it's more than I can do
 And every day or two
 I wind up right back where I started
 
 I'm trying not to let you know
 That I'm still in love with you
 I can't just sit home blue
 'Cause there ain't no rest for the brokenhearted
 
 Just because you won't unlock your door
 That don't mean you don't love me anymore
 So I'm never gonna let you go no matter what you do
 Because you know it's more than I can do
 
 You told me that I got to stop
 But it's more than I can do
 And that ain't nothing new
 'Cause we both know that I'm crazy 'bout you
 
 You said you're gonna call the cops
 But I ain't gonna run
 'Cause you're the only one
 There ain't no way I could live without you
 
 You left me just when I needed you
 So l ain't even close to through with you
 So I'm never gonna let you go no matter what you do
 Because you know it's more than I can do
 
 The wicked King of Clubs awoke
 It was to his Queen turned
 His lips were laughing as they spoke
 His eyes like bullets burned
 The sun's upon a gambling day
 His Queen smiled low and blissfully
 Let's make some wretched fool to play
 Plain it was she did agree
 
 He send his deuce down into diamond
 His four to hart, and his trey to spade
 Three Kings with their legions come
 Preparations soon where made
 They voted club the days commander
 Gave him an army face and number
 All but the outlaw Jack of Diamonds
 And the aces in the sky
 
 He give his sevens first instructions
 Spirit me a game of stud
 Stakes unscarred by limitation
 'Tween a man named Gold and man named Mud
 Club filled gold with greedy vapors
 'Til his long, green eyes did glow
 Mud was left with the sighs and trembles
 Watching his hard earned money go
 
 Flushes fell on gold like water
 Tens they paired and paired again
 But the aces only flew through heaven
 And the diamond Jack called no man friend
 The diamond Queen saw muds ordeal
 Began to think of her long lost son
 Fell to her knees with a mother's mercy
 Prayed to the angels every one
 
 The diamond Queen, she prayed and prayed
 And the diamond angel filled Mud's hole
 The wicked king of clubs himself
 Fell in face down in front of gold
 Now three Kings come to clubs command
 But the angels from the sky did ride
 Three Kings up on the streets of gold
 Three fireballs on the muddy side
 
 The club Queen heard her husband's call
 But Lord that Queen of Diamond's joy
 When the outlaw in the heavenly hall
 Turned out to be a wandering boy
 Now Mud he checked and Gold bet all
 And Mud he raised and Gold did call
 And the smile just melted off his face
 When Mud turned over that diamond ace
 
 Now here's what this story's told
 If you feel like Mud you'll end up Gold
 If you feel like lost, you'll end up found
 So amigo, lay them raises down
 
 Let me tell you bout the girl of mine 
 I got her walkin' down th'assembly line 
 She bring the paycheck home to me 
 My baby, she worships me 
 
 Like the way I walk 
 She like the way I talk 
 That woman can't let me be 
 My baby, she worships me 
 
 Go and tell her, she pays the bill 
 She make a payment on my Coupe de Ville 
 She leave a twenty for me every day 
 My baby, she pays my way 
 Like the way I walk 
 She like the way I talk 
 That woman won't let me be 
 My baby, she worships me 
 
 My baby, she treat me right 
 We ain't never been in a fight 
 Once she caught me with her best friend Sue 
 She just giggled, say "ain't he cute?"
 
 Like the way I walk 
 She like the way I talk 
 That woman can't let me be 
 My baby, she worships me 
 
 My baby, she worships me
 My baby, she worships me
 
 Crimson flames tied through my ears 
 Rollin' high and mighty traps 
 Pounced with fire on flaming roads 
 Using ideas as my maps 
 "We'll meet on edges, soon," said I 
 Proud 'neath heated brow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now 
 Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth 
 "Rip down all hate," I screamed 
 Lies that life is black and white 
 Spoke from my skull. I dreamed 
 Romantic facts of musketeers 
 Foundationed deep, somehow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now. 
 Girls' faces formed the forward path 
 From phony jealousy 
 To memorizing politics 
 Of ancient history 
 Flung down by corpse evangelists 
 Unthought of, though, somehow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now 
 A self-ordained professor's tongue 
 Too serious to fool 
 Spouted out that liberty 
 Is just equality in school 
 "Equality," I spoke the word 
 As if a wedding vow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now 
 In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand 
 At the mongrel dogs who teach 
 Fearing not that I'd become my enemy 
 In the instant that I preach 
 My pathway led by confusion boats 
 Mutiny from stern to bow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now 
 Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats 
 Too noble to neglect 
 Deceived me into thinking 
 I had something to protect 
 Good and bad, I define these terms 
 Quite clear, no doubt, somehow 
 Ah, but I was so much older then 
 I'm younger than that now
 
 Just when every ray of hope was gone 
 I should have known that you would come along 
 I can't believe I ever doubted you 
 My old friend the blues 
 Another lonely night, a nameless town 
 If sleep don't take me first, you'll come around 
 I know I can always count on you 
 My old friend the blues 
 
 Lovers leave and friends will let you down 
 But you're the only sure thing that I've found 
 No matter what I do I'll never lose 
 My old friend the blues 
 
 Lovers leave and friends will let you down 
 But you're the only sure thing that I've found 
 No matter what I do I'll never lose 
 My old friend the blues 
 
 Just let me hide my weary heart in you 
 My old friend the blues
 
 A letter came today from my draft board 
 With trembling hands I read the questionnaire 
 It asked me lots of things about my mamma and poppa 
 Now that ain't what I call exactly fair 
 So I'm headed for the nearest foreign border 
 Vancouver may be my kind of town 
 Cause they don't need the kind of law and order 
 That tends to keep a good man underground 
 A sad old soldier once told me a story 
 About a battlefield that he was on 
 He said a man should never fight for glory 
 He must know what is right and what is wrong 
 So I'm headed for the nearest foreign border 
 Vancouver may be my kind of town 
 Cause they don't need the kind of law and order 
 That tends to keep a good man underground 
 Now I don't know how much I owe my uncle 
 But I suspect it's more than I can pay 
 He's asking me to sign a three year contract 
 I guess I'll catch the first bus out today 
 So I'm headed for the nearest foreign border 
 Vancouver may be my kind of town 
 Cause they don't need the kind of law and order 
 That tends to keep a good man underground
 
 There's a train a comin' 
 There's a train a comin
 Hear them tracks a hummin' 
 There's a train a comin'
 Can't you hear her blowin' 
 Can't you hear her blowin'
 Wonder where she's goin' 
 Can't you hear her blowin'
 
 Run down to the station 
 Run down to the station
 Dread and fascination 
 Run down to the station
 
 Don't you want to ride her 
 Don't you want to ride her
 Wonder what's inside her 
 Don't you want to ride her
 
 She ain't bound for nowhere 
 She ain't bound for nowhere
 Engineer just don't care 
 She ain't bound for nowhere
 
 She run down the mountain 
 She run down the mountain
 She won't even slow down mmm down the mountain
 
 There's a train a comin' 
 There's a train a comin'
 Can't you hear her hummin' 
 There's a train a comin'
 
 He was standing on the highway
 Somewhere way out in the sticks
 Guitar across his shoulder
 Like a 30 ought six
 He was staring in my headlights
 When I come around the bend
 Climbed up on my shotgun side
 And told me with a grin
 
 I'm going to New York City
 I never really been there
 Just like the way it sounds
 I heard the girls are pretty
 There must be something happening there
 It's just too big a town
 
 He was cold and wet and hungry
 Never did complain
 Said he'd come a thousand miles
 Through sleet and snow and rain
 He had a hundred stories
 About the places that he'd been
 He'd hang around a little while
 And hit the road again
 
 He's going to New York City
 I never really been there
 Just like the way it sounds
 He heard the girls are pretty
 There must be something happening there
 It's just too big a town
 
 See I've been to New York City
 Seems like it was yesterday
 I was standing like a pilgrim
 On the Great White Way
 The girls were really pretty
 But they wouldn't talk to me
 I held out about a week
 Went back to Tennessee
 
 So, I thought I'd better warn him
 When he climbed out of my car
 Grabbed his battered suitcase
 Shouldered his guitar
 I knew I was just jealous
 If I didn't wish him well
 I slipped the kid a twenty
 Said 'Billy give 'em hell'
 
 He's going to New York City
 I never really been there
 Just like the way it sounds
 He heard the girls are pretty
 There must be something happening there
 It's just too big a town
 
 He's going to New York City
 I never really been there
 Just like the way it sounds
 He heard the girls are pretty
 There must be something happening there
 It's just too big a town
 
 Goin', goin', goin' to New York City
 
 Going to New York City
 Going to New York City
 
 I saw her standin' on her front lawn just twirlin' her baton
 Me and her went for a ride sir and ten innocent people died
 
 From the town of lincoln, nebraska with a sawed off .410 on my lap
 Through to the badlands of wyoming I killed everything in my path
 
 I can't say that I'm sorry for the things that we done
 At least for a little while sir me and her we had some fun
 
 The jury brought in a guilty verdict and the judge he sentenced me to death
 Midnight in a prison storeroom with leather straps across my chest
 
 Sheriff when the man pulls that switch sir and snaps my poor head back
 You make sure my pretty baby is sittin' right there on my lap
 
 They declared me unfit to live said into that great void my soul'd be hurled
 They wanted to know why I did what I did
 Well sir I guess there's just a meanness in this world
 
 Sunlight slips right through the blinds that's carefully pulled down
 Drive me from my dreamin' and I woke up on the ground
 The phone's ringin' by my head just like I knew it would
 News from Colorado's never good
 
 My brother stole another car, they're holdin' him downtown
 Sister's tellin' everyone he's in the army now
 Mama only says the things that daddy say she should
 News from Colorado's never good
 
 How'd it get so far away, it seemed like only yesterday
 I took my first few steps out on my own
 Look at me in the mirror now I see a thousand miles
 And somehow Colorado doesn't feel like home
 
 There ain't no way to go back even if I wanted to
 It only be a waste of time and there's nothing I can do
 Breaks my heart but somehow I have always understood
 News from Colorado's never good
 
 News from Colorado
 News from Colorado
 News from Colorado
 
 If I had no place to fall
 And I needed to
 Could I count on you
 To lay me down?
 
 I'd never tell you no lies
 I don't believe it's wise
 You got pretty eyes
 Won't you spin me 'round
 
 I ain't much of a lover it's true
 I'm here then I'm gone
 And I'm forever blue
 But I'm sure wanting you
 
 Skies full of silver and gold
 Try to hide the sun
 But it can't be done
 Least not for long
 
 And if we help each other grow
 While the light of day
 Smiles down our way
 Then we can't go wrong
 
 Time, she's a fast old train
 She's here then she's gone
 And she won't come again
 Won't you take my hand
 
 If I had no place to fall
 And I needed to
 Could I count on you
 To lay me down?
 
 I was born and raised here this town's my town 
 Everybody knows my name 
 But ever since the glass plant closed down 
 Things round here ain't never been the same 
 I got me a good job alright but some nights 
 Take me to another time 
 Back when I was No. 29 
 
 I was pretty good then don't you know watch him go 
 Buddy I could really fly 
 Everyone in town came, hip flasks, horn blasts 
 Any autumn Friday night 
 Sally yelled her heart out push em back, way back 
 I was hers and she was mine 
 Back when I was No. 29 
 
 We were playin' Smithville big boys, farm boys 
 Second down and four to go 
 Bubba brought the play in good call my ball 
 Now they're gonna see a show 
 But Bubba let his man go I cut back, heard it crack 
 It still hurts me but I don't mind 
 Reminds me I was No. 29 
 
 Now I go to the ballgames cold nights, half pints 
 Friday nights I'm always here 
 We got a pretty good team, good boys, strong boys 
 District champs the last three years 
 Got a little tailback pretty slick, real quick 
 I take him for a steak sometimes 
 Nowadays he's No. 29 
 
 I don't follow rainbows, big dreams, brass rings 
 I've already captured mine 
 Back when I was No. 29
 
 Well, I'm sittin' in the depot long before the break of day
 I just bought my ticket, lord I hope the bus ain't late
 I'll have a cup of coffee and a sandwich from the microwave
 Now I'm gonna see my baby if it's the last thing I ever do
 Got this sittin' in the station sick and tired of waitin'
 Continental Trailways blues
 
 Well rollin' out for Houston, man we're finally rollin' now
 Try to get some sleep and listen to that highway sound
 I guess we must have stopped in every single little town
 Now I've bought myself a copy of the Natchez, Mississippi news
 With the just pulled out of lake Charles rollin' into Sulphur
 Continental Trailways blues
 
 Now, we're rollin' into Houston, don't them city lights look fine
 Headed for the pay phone, hangin' onto my last dime
 Well, she says she's got a new man, son, it's been a long, long time
 She left me standin' by the highway with the rain runnin' through my shoes
 With the sittin' by the road side wishin' I was inside continental Trailways blues
 
 I got the wishin' I was downtown waitin' on a Greyhound
 Continental Trailways blues
 
 Daddy used to tell me "Don't you drag your feet" 
 "Never seen a good intention that a man could eat" 
 Well, I got about a million things I need to do 
 I don't want to think about nothin' but you 
 
 Everybody talk about Maybellene 
 Yellow rose of Texas and the sweet sixteen 
 Well, I don't want to hear about no Peggy Sue 
 I don't want to think about nothin' but you
 
 I don't need no money, no fancy car 
 House up on the hill where all the rich folks are 
 Well, they can have the whiskey, keep the cocaine, too 
 I don't want to think about nothin' but you 
 
 I'm the keeper of your heart 
 I keep the flame when we're apart 
 I'm the lover in your arms 
 Or a baby soft and warm 
 
 I'm a hero in your eyes 
 I'm a comfort when you cry 
 When you hurt me I'm your fool 
 But I'm nothin' without you 
 
 No I'm nothin' without you 
 It don't matter what I do 
 If I win or if I lose 
 Sweetheart I'm nothin' without you 
 
 I'm a beacon in the night 
 To show the way until it's light 
 I'm a stumbler in the dark 
 When I can't say what's in my heart 
 
 I'm a poet just the same 
 Every time I speak your name 
 I'm just a shadow when I'm blue 
 But I'm nothin' without you 
 
 No I'm nothin' without you 
 It don't matter what I do 
 If I win or if I lose 
 Sweetheart I'm nothin' without you
 
 Once upon a time, in a far off land
 Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand
 Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night
 Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
 
 They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
 Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
 They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
 And this miracle they prized was nothing but a child
 
 Nothing but a child could wash those tears away
 Or guide a weary world into the light of day
 And nothing but a child could help erase those miles
 So once again we all can be children for awhile
 
 Now all around the world, in every little town
 Everyday is heard a precious little sound
 And every mother kind and every father proud
 Looks down in awe to find another chance allowed
 
 Nothing but a child could wash those tears away
 Or guide a weary world into the light of day
 And nothing but a child could help erase those miles
 So once again we all can be children for awhile
 
 Nothing but a child
 
 She was her daddy's little darlin'
 Her mama's only child
 They didn't understand at all
 When she took to running wild
 
 She left town one day and never said goodbye
 Left a hole in daddy's lap and a tear in mama's eye
 Where'd we go wrong and now she's gone
 
 She met a boy up in Kentucky
 Charlie was his name
 Just when he thought he got lucky
 She stole his watch and chain
 
 She always kept on movin' and she never wasted time
 And they said, "She left quite a string of broken hearts behind"
 Woke up alone, now she's gone
 
 Me, I wouldn't even trying
 You could say I was content
 She went through my life like lightning
 Blew out the other end
 
 Well I still taste her kisses, smell her perfume in the wind
 And if I could you know that I would do it all again
 She done me wrong, and now she's gone
 
 Oh, there's a road, in Oklahoma
 Straighter than a preacher
 Longer than a memory
 And it goes, forever onward
 He's been a good teacher
 For a lot of country boys like me
 
 I push that load, from here to someday
 I'll push as long as I'm alive
 But I don't know how long I'll last
 'Cause it's just a road, it ain't no highway
 I'm blowin' by the double five
 I know I'm going way too fast
 
 I been down this road just searching' for the end
 It don't go nowhere, it just brings you back again
 Leaves you lonely and cold
 Standin' on the shoulder
 But you've come too far to go back home
 So you're walkin' on a nowhere road
 
 Some folks say, if you keep rollin'
 And you keep it on the yellow line
 It'll take you on the big highway
 But there's a toll to pay
 If you're going
 The keeper at the gate is blind
 So you better be prepared to pay
 
 I been down this road just searching' for the end
 It don't go nowhere, it just brings you back again
 Leaves you lonely and cold
 Standin' on the shoulder
 But you've come too far to go back home
 So you're walkin' on a nowhere road, hey
 
 A long time ago, there laid a man,
 He had the world in the palm of his hand
 Sultans and kings beat a path to his door,
 Had everything but he still wanted more
 
 One day in spring came a lady so fair,
 And he'd never looked on a beauty so rare
 But he didn't trust her,
 So he locked her away,
 The gold lost its lustre when the love died that day
 
 Once you love, once you trust it,
 Once you give, your soul is bare
 One false move and you know you're busted,
 Once you love, you care
 
 I knew an old man who lived all alone
 A sad little house at the end of the road
 Sat on his front porch, in an old rocking chair,
 Everyone swore he'd gone crazy down there
 
 But no-one comes near, so how could they know,
 He lost someone dear to him once long ago
 He remembers the laughter, still tastes the tears,
 Still calls her name out after all of these years
 
 Once you love, once you trust it,
 Once you give, your soul is bare
 One false move and you know you're busted,
 Once you love, you care
 
 You can keep it all inside,
 You can run but you can't hide
 When you think it's safe outside,
 Look behind you love will find you
 
 Once you love, once you trust it,
 Once you give, your soul is bare
 One false move and you know you're busted,
 'Cause once you love, you care
 
 Once you trust it,
 Once you care
 Once you trust it
 Once you care
 Once you trust it
 Once you care
 Once you trust it
 Once you care
 
 Here I am sittin' on your porch, dear 
 Beggin' you darlin', let me in 
 In total submission I have come here 
 Oh sweetheart, I know how bad I've been 
 
 I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway 
 I won't spit my tobacco on your floor 
 I'll come runnin' when you call me 
 If you just opened up your door 
 
 If you tell me you still love me 
 I won't drink or cuss no more 
 I won't call your mama ugly 
 And I won't chase women like before 
 
 I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway 
 I won't spit my tobacco on your floor 
 I'll come runnin' when you call me 
 If you just opened up your door 
 
 I won't let my dog sleep in your hallway 
 I won't spit my tobacco on your floor 
 I'll come runnin' when you call me 
 If you just opened up your door 
 If you just opened up your door
 
 Just open your window 
 On a night like tonight 
 No matter which way the wind blows 
 Let your heart out to ride 
 High above all the care and woe 
 In the world down below 
 Just open your window 
 Then you'll know where to go 
 On a big city sidewalk 
 All alone in a crowd 
 No one listenin' when he talks 
 To himself right out loud 
 He was somebody's darlin' boy 
 She held him close when he cried 
 Just open your window 
 And let him inside 
 You may think that you're dreaming 
 You may think you've gone blind 
 If your eyes fail to see 'em 
 Listen hard and you'll find 
 There's a song that the angels know 
 Ringin' true every time 
 If you open your window 
 Let the music inside
 
 Come on pretty baby won't you take me by the hand 
 I thought maybe that I could be your man 
 And for a while  we could go in style 
 Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon 
 
 I gotta keep movin', 'cause baby I'm a travelin' man 
 And there ain't a lot of women out there that understand 
 But if you do  I'll be good to you 
 Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon 
 
 Goin' up the country honey, don't you want to go? 
 Gotta little money, all you gotta do is let me know 
 I know a place we could disappear without a trace 
 Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon
 
 The warden said he'd mail my letter
 The chaplain's waitin' by the door
 Tonight we'll cross the yard together
 Then they can't hurt me anymore.
 
 I am going over yonder
 Where no ghost can follow me
 There's another place beyond here
 Where I'll be free I believe.
 
 Give my radio to Johnson
 Thibodeaux can have my fan
 Send my Bible home to Mama
 Call her every now and then.
 
 I suppose I got it comin'
 I can't ever pay enough
 All my rippin' and a runnin'
 I hurt everyone I loved.
 
 The world'll turn around without me
 The sun'll come up in the east
 Shinin' down on all of them that hate me
 I hope my goin' brings 'em peace.
 
 Well my daddy worked in the coal mine
 Till the company shut it down
 Then he sat around and drank hisself blind
 Till we put him back underground
 Now nothin' grows on this mountain
 And what's a poor boy to do?
 Except to wander these hills forgotten
 With the Oxycontin blues
 
 Well I never cared much for whiskey
 'Cause it only made daddy mean
 Wrapped a little bit tight they tell me
 For the methamphetamine
 Then my cousin come up from Knoxville
 And he taught me a thing or two
 Now I'm headed nowhere but downhill
 With the Oxycontin blues
 
 Got a dollar bill in my pocket
 Got a half a tank in my truck
 I'm gonna go and pawn grandma's locket
 Hell, maybe it'll change my luck
 Ain't nothin gonna be right no how
 'Cause I know I can't ever lose
 This devil that's draggin' me down
 And the Oxycontin blues
 
 Living on the road my friend
 Was gonna keep you free and clean
 Now you wear your skin like iron
 Your breath's as hard as kerosene
 You weren't your mama's only boy
 But her favorite one it seems
 She began to cry when you said goodbye
 And sank into your dreams
 
 Pancho was a bandit boys
 His horse was fast as polished steel
 Wore his gun outside his pants
 For all the honest world to feel
 Pancho met his match you know
 On the deserts down in Mexico
 Nobody heard his dying words
 That's the way it goes
 
 All the federales say
 They could have had him any day
 They only let him hang around
 Out of kindness I suppose
 
 Lefty he can't sing the blues
 All night long like he used to
 The dust that Pancho bit down south
 Ended up in Lefty's mouth
 The day they laid poor Pancho low
 Lefty split for Ohio
 Where he got the bread to go
 There ain't nobody knows
 
 All the federales say
 They could have had him any day
 They only let him slip away
 Out of kindness I suppose
 
 The poets tell how Pancho fell
 Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
 The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
 So the story ends we're told
 Pancho needs your prayers it's true,
 But save a few for Lefty too
 He just did what he had to do
 Now he's growing old
 
 A few gray federales say
 They could have had him any day
 They only let him go so wrong
 Out of kindness I suppose
 
 And then she holds my hand, mm
 And then I understand. mm
 Her eyes afire with one desire
 Then a heavenly kiss
 Could I resist?
 And then she dims the light, mm
 And then she holds me tight. mm
 Her kiss, each fond caress
 They lead the way to happiness
 She takes me to paradise
 
 And then he holds my hand, mm
 And then I understand. mm
 His eyes afire with one desire
 Then a heavenly kiss
 Could I resist?
 And then he dims the light, mm
 And then he holds me tight. mm
 Her kiss, each fond caress
 They lead the way to happiness
 She takes me to paradise
 
 I am just a pilgrim on this road, boys 
 This ain't never been my home 
 Sometimes the road was rocky long the way, boys 
 But I was never travelin' alone 
 
 We'll meet again on some bright highway 
 Songs to sing and tales to tell 
 But I am just a pilgrim on this road, boys 
 Until I see you fare thee well 
 
 Ain't no need to cry for me, boys 
 Somewhere down the road you'll understand 
 Cause I expect to touch his hand, boys 
 Put a word in for you if I can
 
 Boys out on the corner
 The way they were before
 But me I don't go down there
 With my money anymore
 Yeah I can still remember when
 It used to kill the pain
 But I woke up every mornin'
 With a pocketful of rain
 
 Ain't like it's been easy
 I been up and down
 And lately I can't seem to keep
 My chin up off the ground
 But I'd rather eat a pound of dirt than
 Taste that taste again
 And a world of hurt is better than
 A pocket full of rain
 
 Talk about the devil and up he jump
 Down beside the levee on a hollow stump
 Shakin' like a window girl in Amsterdam
 I don't wanna be no closer than I am
 To tell you he's the devil
 'Cause I know all his names
 And I know all his faces well
 He's the devil just the same
 He'll look you in the eye and lie
 And promise anything
 Leave you cold and empty as
 A pocket full of rain
 
 I was almost outta here
 I nearly left this time
 I saw you in my rear  view mirror
 And I pulled up on a dime
 
 But nothin' ventured, nothin' lost
 You can't say we didn't try
 That is unless you weigh the cost
 Of every tear we cried
 
 Why do we do this to each other
 I guess we were always poison lovers
 
 If you could look me in the eye
 And tell me what you see
 Maybe you can tell me why
 I let you torture me
 
 I know that your lips are soft
 And they sing the sweetest songs
 But I've been listenin' long enough
 My heart has turned to stone
 
 Why do we do this to each other
 Guess we were always poison lovers
 
 Another time, another place
 Another wind to blame
 Cover every track and trace
 I'll find you just the same
 
 And even if we made our peace
 And went our separate ways
 You'd go west and I'd go east
 And we'd meet here in this place
 
 Why do we do this to each other
 I guess we were always poison lovers
 Why do we do this to each other
 Guess we were always poison lovers
 
 I was born on the other side of town
 Everybody over here just put me down
 I never thought about it much
 Till the first time I saw you
 Uh oh, what's a poor boy gonna do
 
 It's bad enough to love you from afar
 Me down here and you up where you are
 If you hadn't given me that look
 That's all it took it's true
 Uh oh, what's a poor boy gonna do
 
 Baby what's a poor boy got, not a heck of a lot
 Just a heart that's true
 One thing he sure don't need is
 A heart that bleeds and these lovesick blues
 
 I know a poor boy can't go far
 Baby, maybe someday drive your car
 And I can look in my rear view, into those eyes of blue
 Uh oh what's a poor boy gonna do
 
 Baby what's a poor boy got, not a heck of a lot
 Just a heart that's true
 One thing he sure don't need is
 A heart that bleeds and these lovesick blues
 
 I know a poor boy can't go far
 Baby, maybe someday drive your car
 And I can look in my rear view, into those eyes of blue
 Uh oh what's a poor boy gonna do
 Uh oh what's a poor boy gonna do
 
 No curtains on my window 
 Outside the sun is sinking low 
 I feel you letting go 
 I will promise you anything 
 
 Wind whispering in your ear 
 I'll tell you what you want to hear 
 If you'll only let me near 
 I will promise you anything 
 
 Well, I don't have to prove my intentions are golden 
 I don't have to tell you where we're goin' 
 Feel somethin' wild baby out there blowin' 
 If you follow me 
 
 Run with me if you dare 
 Hold on I'm gonna take you there 
 Solemn as a prayer 
 I will promise you anything 
 
 No curtains on my window 
 Outside the moon is hangin' low 
 True colors start to show 
 I will promise you anything
 
 Hank Williams died when I was five
 He sang I'll never get out of this world alive
 Now it's been a long time since I was that kid
 And I've seen a lot more than Hank ever did
 I've done the down and out in every dark end dive
 But I'll never get out of your love alive
 
 Sam Coke met the woman at the well
 She told him that his song was something he could never sell
 And I think he knew a change was gonna come
 Still he lived too fast and he died too young
 Well dying young I have survived
 But I'll never get out of your love alive
 
 I got washed in the blood of Bill Monroe
 When he sang about the the blues in the body and soul
 He believed in a God that could raise the dead
 Still it's a mighty dark night to travel he said
 I've seen a mighty dark night and I made that drive
 But I'll never get out of your love alive
 
 Robert Johnson had a hellhound on his trail
 Drove him to the coffin like a hammer and a nail
 It takes a powerful man to carry that load
 When your trying to beat the devil to the old crossroads
 I wrestled the devil lived to testify
 But I'll never get out of your love alive
 I'll never get out of your love alive
 I'll never get out of your love alive
 I'll never get out of your love alive
 
 I used to wake and run with the moon
 I lived like a rake and a young man
 I covered my lovers with flowers and wounds
 My laughter the devil would frighten
 The sun she would come and beat me back down
 But every cruel day had it's nightfall
 I'd welcome the stars with wine and guitars
 Full of fire and forgetful
 
 My body was sharp the dark air clean
 And outrage my joyful companion
 Whisperin' women how sweet did they seem
 Kneelin' for me to command them
 And time was like water but I was the sea
 I'd have never noticed it passin'
 Except for the turnin' of night into day
 And the turnin' of day into cursin'
 
 You look at me now, and don't think I don't know
 What all your eyes are a sayin'
 Does he want us to believe these ravings and lies
 They're just tricks that his brains been a playin'?
 A lover of women he can't hardly stand
 He trembles he's bent and he's broken
 I've fallen it's true but I say unto you
 Hold your tongues until after I've spoken
 
 I was takin' my pride in the pleasures I'd known
 I laughed and thought I'd be forgiven
 But my laughter turned 'round eyes blazing and
 Said my friend, we're holdin' a wedding
 I buried my face but it spoke once again
 The night to the day we're a bindin'
 And now the dark air is like fire on my skin
 And even the moonlight is blinding
 
 North wind blowin' like a hurricane house
 Old man leanin' like he's pullin' a plow
 Neck bowed, bendin' like a willow bough
 
 Red sky color of the end of time
 Bleeds dry runnin' down the center line
 Wise guy pretends he doesn't see the signs
 
 Bad news everybody talkin' 'bout
 A short fuse a half an inch from burnin' out
 All used up beyond a reasonable doubt
 
 Make way for his majesty the prodigal king
 Still taste the poison when you're kissin' the ring
 Don't say he never gave you anything
 
 Deep breath the calm before the storm begins
 Cold sweat pretend that you ain't listenin'
 Don't bet on gettin' by with that again
 
 Short ride from here to where the beast resides
 Fine line that separates the shadows inside
 Make mine a double shot of cyanide
 
 Last night I saw Lester Maddox on a TV show
 With some smart ass New York Jew
 And the Jew laughed at Lester Maddox
 And the audience laughed at Lester Maddox too
 Well he may be a fool but he's our fool
 If they think they're better than him they're wrong
 So I went to the park and I took some paper along
 And that's where I made this song
 
 We talk real funny down here
 We drink too much and we laugh too loud
 We're too dumb to make it in no Northern town
 And we're keepin' the niggers down
 
 We got no-necked oilmen from Texas
 And good ol' boys from Tennessee
 And colleges men from LSU
 Went in dumb. Come out dumb too
 Hustlin' 'round Atlanta in their alligator shoes
 Gettin' drunk every weekend at the barbecues
 And they're keepin' the niggers down
 
 We're rednecks, rednecks
 And we don't know our ass from a hole in the ground
 We're rednecks, we're rednecks
 And we're keeping the niggers down
 
 Now your northern nigger's a Negro
 You see he's got his dignity
 Down here we're too ignorant to realize
 That the North has set the nigger free
 
 Yes he's free to be put in a cage
 In Harlem in New York City
 And he's free to be put in a cage on the South-Side of Chicago
 And the West-Side
 And he's free to be put in a cage in Hough in Cleveland
 And he's free to be put in a cage in East St. Louis
 And he's free to be put in a cage in Fillmore in San Francisco
 And he's free to be put in a cage in Roxbury in Boston
 They're gatherin' 'em up from miles around
 Keepin' the niggers down
 
 We're rednecks, rednecks
 And we don't know our ass from a hole in the ground
 We're rednecks, we're rednecks
 And we're keeping the niggers down
 
 I'm just a regular guy
 Never get rich, but I always get by
 I got me a wife and a couple a kids
 I done pretty much like my daddy did
 
 He always did the best that he could
 Took care of mama and us pretty good
 He never got rich but he never did try
 He was just a regular guy
 
 Well, the world goes around
 I can't stop it
 So I'll sit back and watch the sun go down
 If it comes back up then this day's a good one
 
 You know I wouldn't be that surprised
 I'm just a regular guy and I'll work until the day that I die
 I'm too young to quit, too old to hire
 These days a man can't afford to retire
 
 Didn't vote for nobody last time
 'Cause they wasn't worth a trickle down dime
 But one man's promise is another man's lie
 And I'm just a regular guy
 
 Here we are sittin' in the warm sunshine
 I'm holdin' your tiny hand in mine
 And god know's it ain't gonna be any time
 Before you're grown
 But I wasn't young when you come along
 And chances are long before that day comes
 My time in this sweet ol' world'll be done
 And I'll be gone
 
 You're lookin' at me I'm lookin' at you
 And it's everything a grown man can do
 Not to break down and cry like a fool
 When you smile at me
 I can only that hope I do my best
 With whatever time that we got left
 And when everything's done and said
 You'll remember me
 
 Remember me on some sunny day
 When everything's goin' your way
 'Cause on the day you were born I prayed
 That's the way it would be
 Remember me on a stormy night
 When there's no sign of shelter in sight
 And you soldier on through to the light
 'Cause that's all you see
 Remember me
 
 You got angels watchin' over you
 And your mama don't suffer fools
 And there ain't nothin' that she wouldn't do for you
 I don't believe
 But there'll come a day when you're all alone
 And you'll have to stand up on your own
 And when it's muscle and blood and bone
 Remember me
 
 
 Jimmy joined the army '??cause he had no place to go 
 There ain't nobody hirin' 
 'Round here since all the jobs went 
 Down to Mexico 
 Reckoned that he'd learn himself a trade maybe see the world 
 Move to the city someday and marry a black haired girl 
 Somebody somewhere had another plan 
 Now he's got a rifle in his hand 
 Rollin' into Baghdad wonderin' how he got this far 
 Just another poor boy off to fight a rich man's war 
 
 Bobby had an eagle and a flag tattooed on his arm 
 Red white and blue to the bone when he landed in Kandahar 
 Left behind a pretty young wife and a baby girl 
 A stack of overdue bills and went off to save the world 
 Been a year now and he's still there 
 Chasin' ghosts in the thin dry air 
 Meanwhile back at home the finance company took his car 
 Just another poor boy off to fight a rich man's war 
 
 When will we ever learn 
 When will we ever see 
 We stand up and take our turn 
 And keep tellin' ourselves we're free 
 
 Ali was the second son of a second son 
 Grew up in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks when the tanks would come 
 Ain't nothin' else to do around here just a game children play 
 Somethin' 'bout livin' in fear all your life makes you hard that way 
 
 He answered when he got the call 
 Wrapped himself in death and praised Allah 
 A fat man in a new Mercedes drove him to the door 
 Just another poor boy off to fight a rich man's war
 
 By the rivers of Babylon
 Where he sat down
 And there he wept
 When he remembered Zion
 
 It was the wicked
 Carry us away captivity
 Require from us a song
 How can we sing King Alfa's song
 In a strange land?
 
 By the rivers of Babylon
 Where he sat down
 And there he wept
 When he remembered Zion
 
 Oh, but the wicked
 Carry us away captivity
 Require from us a song
 How can we sing King Alfa's song
 In a strange land?
 
 By the rivers of Babylon
 Where he sat down
 And there he wept
 When he remembered Zion
 
 By the rivers of Babylon
 Where he sat down
 And there he wept
 When he remembered Zion
 
 By the rivers of Babylon
 Where he sat down
 And there he wept
 When he remembered Zion
 
 She would never say where she came from
 Yesterday don't matter if it's gone
 While the sun is bright
 Or in the darkest night
 No one knows, she comes and goes
 
 Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
 Who could hang a name on you?
 When you change with every new day
 Still I'm gonna miss you
 
 Don't question why she needs to be so free
 She'll tell you it's the only way to be
 She just can't be chained
 To a life where nothings gained
 And nothings lost, at such a cost
 
 Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
 Who could hang a name on you?
 When you change with every new day
 Still I'm gonna miss you
 
 "There's no time to lose", I heard her say
 Catch your dreams before they slip away
 Dying all the time
 Lose your dreams and you will lose your mind
 Ain't life unkind?
 
 Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
 Who could hang a name on you?
 When you change with every new day
 Still I'm gonna miss you
 
 Goodbye Ruby Tuesday
 Who could hang a name on you?
 When you change with every new day
 Still I'm gonna miss you
 
 Since I first saw you I've been thinkin' about you 
 And now I'm out here on this highway goin' crazy without you 
 I can't help but want you girl, you're young and you're pretty 
 But somehow I can't see you up in New York City 
 
 Gonna leave you alone in your own little world 
 Won't you be my San Antonio girl?
 Be my San Antonio girl 
 Be my, be my, be my San Antonio girl, hey now
 
 Now I know you've heard the stories bout life in the fast lane 
 What they didn't tell you is you come home on a slow train 
 I'd just as soon remember you the way that I found you 
 Dancin' by yourself with the stars all around you
 
 I'm gonna leave you alone in my own little world 
 Won't you be my San Antonio girl?
 Be my San Antonio girl 
 Be my, be my, be my San Antonio girl, hey now
 
 Be my San Antonio Girl
 Won't you, won't you be my San Antonio Girl?
 
 Top of my shift-frog in my throat-sleep in my eyes
 Startin' to drift, cuppa hot joe, checkin' the sky
 Never can tell, makin' my list, checkin' it twice
 Fasten my belt, flippin' my switch, checkin' my mic
 
 Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
 Big daddy on the air, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
 At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
 Is there anybody listenin' to earth tonight on the satellite radio?
 
 Listen to the radio
 Listen to the radio
 
 Turn it on
 Turn it up
 
 What if they're right? What if I'm wrong? What if we're kings?
 One of these nights-play the right song-telephone rings
 Stone in the sea, shot in the dark, splittin' the air
 Listen to me, kindle the spark, answer my prayer
 
 Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
 Does anybody care, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
 At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright, are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
 Is there anybody listenin' to us tonight on the satellite radio?
 
 Listen to the radio
 Listen to the radio
 
 Turn it on
 
 Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
 Big daddy on the air, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
 At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright, are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
 Is there anybody listenin' to earth tonight on the satellite radio?
 
 Is there anybody out there? One-two-three on the satellite radio?
 Big daddy on the air, are you listenin' to me? On the satellite radio
 At the galaxy's end where the stars burn bright, are you tunin' in and turnin' on?
 Is there anybody listenin' to earth tonight on the satellite radio?
 
 Listen to the radio
 
 Way out yonder, where the wild wind blows 
 There's a place there lonely fools can go 
 Where if you hold your money, it'll burn your hand 
 So you buy you a ticket to the shadowland 
 
 Down the highway, down the road I'm bound 
 And my heart keeps poundin' and the wheels go 'round 
 And it's a hard place for a mortal man 
 And a heartbroke pilgrim in the shadowland 
 
 Yeah, when I was younger I could hold my own 
 My right hand was thunder and my left was stone 
 Now I ain't as handsome as I was back then 
 So I'm takin' my chances in the shadowland 
 
 Been down a thousand highways and they're all the same 
 Another empty place where I can hide my shame 
 And there's a heartache waitin' up around the bend 
 For a lonesome stranger in the shadowland 
 
 She's not the kind that I'd take home to mama
 'Cause mama always asks me how you are
 She can't make it all right the way that you could
 But she' can't break my heart
 
 She's not the one I spent my whole life searching for
 But it won't hurt me one bit when she walks out the door
 And she won't be there to hold me when I fall apart
 But she can't break my heart
 
 It's not the kind of love you can depend on
 But this time we both knew that from the start
 And I never miss her when she's not beside me
 But she can't break my heart
 
 She's not the one I spent my whole life searching for
 But it won't hurt me one bit when she walks out the door
 And she won't be there to hold me when I fall apart
 But she can't break my heart
 
 She was walking down the street 
 Looking fine as she could be, hey, hey 
 She was walking down the street 
 She's looking fine as she could be, hey, hey 
 You know I love you, baby 
 Oh hear what is say, hey, hey 
 She walked right up to me 
 Said, "Hey, big boy, what's your name?" 
 She walked right up to me 
 Said, "Hey, big boy, what's your name?" Hey, hey 
 We had love and conversation 
 
 Oh yeah, what I say, hey hey 
 She's about a mover 
 She's about a mover 
 She's about a mover 
 She's about a mover 
 Hey, hey 
 She's about a mover 
 She's about a mover 
 
 You know I love you, baby 
 Oh yeah, what I say, yeah, hey 
 Now, she walked right up to me, talkin' about me 
 She said, "Hey, big boy, what's your name?" 
 Well, she walked right up to me 
 Said, "Hey, big boy, what's your name?" 
 We had love and conversation 
 
 Oh yeah, what I say, hey hey 
 She's about a mover 
 She's about a mover 
 She's about a mover 
 She's about a mover, hey
 
 When she walks
 You'd think she just stepped out of a magazine
 When she talks
 You'd swear you heard her voice in you fondest dreams
 She got the money, she got the looks
 The lips like honey, she even cooks
 But she's so mean
 
 When she's hot
 You can put your arms around her and feel the fire
 When she's not
 You're burning up inside from your own desire
 She heats you up, she'll cool you down
 No matter what, you hang around
 Aw but she's so mean
 
 She's so mean
 She's so mean
 
 She's so mean
 Aw, she's so mean
 You try to hold her, she'll laugh and run
 You try to kiss her, she'll bit your tongue
 Yea, she's so mean
 She's so mean
 She's so mean
 
 Sister's coming home

 Dancin' on the rock'n roll
 Sister likes to do it 
 Lord, sister likes to move her soul
 Down at the corner beer joint 
 Dancin' on a hardwood floor
 
 Her jeans fit

 Than they did before

 Ladies and gentlemen, attention please 
 Come in close so everyone can see 
 I got a tale to tell 
 A listen don't cost a dime 
 And if you believe that we're gonna get along just fine 
 
 Now I've been travelin' all around 
 I heard trouble's come to your town 
 I've got a little somethin' 
 Guaranteed to ease your mind 
 It's call snake oil y'all 
 It's been around for a long, long time 
 
 Well your crops will burn if it don't rain soon 
 Ain't seen a drop since the tenth of June 
 Well I can open up the sky 
 People have no fear 
 If you ain't impressed yet, tell me what you want to hear 
 
 Well you lost your farm so you moved to town 
 Get a job, they shut the factory down 
 Now you sit around all day long feelin' sad and blue 
 You need snake oil y'all, tell you what I'm gonna do, step right up 
 
 I can heal the sick and I can mend the lame 
 And the blind shall see again, it's all the same 
 
 Well ain't your President good to you 
 Knocked 'em dead in Libya, Grenada too 
 Now he's taking that show, a little further down the line 
 'Tween me and him, people, you're gonna get along just fine, hup
 
 It's called snake oil y'all
 Snake oil y'all
 Ah snake oil y'all
 Called snake oil y'all
 It's called snake oil y'all
 It's been around a long long time
 
 So you wanna be an outlaw, better take it from me
 Living on the highway, ain't everything it's suppose to be
 Everybody reckons that they wanna be free
 Ain't no body wants to be alone
 
 Stumblin in the alley at a quarter to three
 Hollaring after Sally, "Honey, what you trying to do to me."
 Told me "Go to hell, i'm going back to Tennessee."
 I said, "Angel, you can never go home."
 
 Never go home
 Never go home
 If you wanna be an outlaw you can never go home
 
 So you wanna be outlaw, better listen up kid
 Steal a million dollar and you have to keep it hid
 Ain't no place to spend it in the desert if you did
 And you can't take it with you when you go
 
 Always something laying for you up around the bend
 Everything that goes around comes back around again
 You can't trust anybody, not a lover or a friend
 Your momma, maybe, then you never know
 
 Never do know. 
 Never do know. 
 If you wanna be an outlaw, then you never do know
 
 So you wanna be an outlaw, son you better think twice
 You better not pout and you better not cry
 Cuz there won't nobody give a damn about you when you die
 But the devil when he comes for his due
 
 When you're standing at the cross roads, don't you try to flag a ride
 Don't you fall down on your knees, don't you do what's already been tried
 Hate to tell you but the only the left side is to sing the devil out of the blues
 
 Singing the blues
 Keep on singing the blues
 Sing the "So you wanna be an outlaw" Blues
 
 Hey Hey
 
 Sensitivity ain't your style
 A cheap box of candy and an Elvis smile
 Drove me wild
 That was some blue moons ago
 It used to thrill me when you'd hold me tight
 But I don't want another summer's night
 Baby, it's alright
 That was some blue moons ago
 
 I need a warm romance
 Gotta take a chance
 Gotta let those feelings show
 We need to give and take
 C'mon communicate
 Baby, love's not touch and go
 Like it was some blue moons ago
 
 C'mon baby, it's a brand new day
 I need your love but in a different way
 Hold me, honey, it don't take much
 All I need is just a little touch
 
 I'm not hangin' on to yesterday
 We need the kind of love that's built to stay
 Baby here today
 Not some blue moons ago
 
 I need a warm romance
 Gotta take a chance
 Gotta let those feelings show
 We need to give and take
 C'mon communicate
 Baby, love's not touch and go
 Like it was some blue moons ago
 
 When I was a little guy 
 My daddy told me "Mister, 
 Don't ever try to climb too high 
 Cause it's the fall that gets ya 
 And some dreams can never come true 
 They'll never come true" 
 Well, I heard every word he said 
 But I don't guess I listened 
 But every time I banged my head 
 Against the wall or system 
 Yeah, some dreams don't ever come true 
 Don't ever come true 
 But some dreams do 
 If you just hang on 
 And your heart is true 
 And your hope is strong 
 Well, just because you've been around 
 And had your poor heart broken 
 That's no excuse for lyin' there 
 Before the last word's spoken 
 Cause some dreams don't ever come true 
 Don't ever come true 
 Aw, but some dreams do 
 When you're feelin' low 
 And you think you're through 
 That's when you will know 
 Yeah, when you wish upon a star 
 Buddy, don't you miss it 
 Catch it 'fore it falls too far 
 Keep it with your secrets 
 Cause some dreams don't ever come true 
 Don't ever come true 
 Don't ever come true 
 But some dreams do
 
 There ain't a lot that you can do in this town 
 You drive down to the lake and then you turn back around 
 You go to school and you learn to read and write 
 So you can walk into the county bank and sign away your life 
 I work at the fillin' station on the interstate 
 Pumpin' gasoline and countin' out of state plates 
 They ask me how far into Memphis son, and where's the nearest beer 
 And they don't even know that there's a town around here 
 
 Someday I'm finally gonna let go 
 'Cause I know there's a better way 
 And I wanna know what's over that rainbow 
 I'm gonna get out of here someday 
 Someday 
 
 Now my brother went to college 'cause he played football 
 I'm still hangin' round cause I'm a little bit small 
 I got me a 67 Chevy, she's low and sleek and black 
 Someday I'll put her on that interstate and never look back
 
 Someday I'm finally gonna let go 
 'Cause I know there's a better way 
 And I wanna know what's over that rainbow 
 I'm gonna get out of here someday 
 I'm gonna get out of here someday 
 Someday
 Someday
 
 Once upon a time
 A hero always knew his lines
 But this ain't no movie
 And you're no damsel in distress
 You just need some tenderness
 The only words I can find are
 
 I'm gonna love you
 Someone's got to do it
 Darlin' I can get you through it
 If you hold onto me
 I'm gonna love you
 There ain't nothin' to it
 And if someone's got to do it
 Why can't it be me
 
 Somewhere down the line
 Everybody hopes to find
 A love that shines
 Just like a beacon in the night
 And then holds up in the light
 Maybe if we give it time
 
 I'm gonna love you
 Someone's got to do it
 Darlin' I can get you through it
 If you hold onto me
 I'm gonna love you
 There ain't nothin' to it
 And if someone's got to do it
 Why can't it be me
 
 I'm gonna love you
 Someone's got to do it
 Darlin' I can get you through it
 If you hold onto me
 I'm gonna love you
 There ain't nothin' to it
 And if someone's got to do it
 Why can't it be me
 
 Once upon a time
 
 I've been in this honky-tonk before
 Drug my boot heels round-n-round that floor
 But my knees give out when I've had a few
 I start trying to find somethin' to hold on to
 
 I've danced with half the women in this bar
 But I ain't found what I've been looking for
 But my heart stood still the minute I saw you
 And I knew I'd found somethin' to hold on to
 
 I've been holdin' out all these lonely nights
 But I can't stop now cause it feels so right
 After all this time I never dreamed I'd find
 Someone who'd always be true
 Somethin' to hold on to
 Somethin' to hold on to
 
 I've been holdin' out all these lonely nights
 But I can't stop now cause it feels so right
 After all this time I never dreamed I'd find
 Someone who'd always be true
 Somethin' to hold on to
 Somethin' to hold on to
 
 Somethin' to hold on to
 Somethin' to hold on to
 
 If you see her out tonight
 And she tells you it's just the lights
 That bring her here and not her loneliness
 That's what she says but sometimes she forgets
 
 If she tells you she don't need a man
 She's had all the comfort she can stand
 You'd best believe every word she says
 But don't give up 'cause sometimes she forgets
 
 Sometimes she forgets that not too long ago she swore
 She wasn't gonna let her heart be broken anymore
 
 So now she keeps it locked away
 It grows colder every day
 And it won't warm to any man's caress
 That's what she says but sometimes she forgets
 
 Yeh sometimes she forgets that not too long ago she swore
 She wasn't gonna let her heart be broken anymore
 
 So if you see her out tonight
 And she tells you it's just the lights
 That bring her here and not her loneliness
 That's what she says but sometimes she forgets
 Hey now don't give up 'cause sometimes she forgets
 
 Somewhere out there in the world tonight
 Just out of my reach
 I hear your heart beat
 It's comin' in loud and clear tonight
 Poundin' in my brain
 It's callin' out your name
 
 In the darkness something binds you to me
 So that I can find you
 When you want me
 I will be there
 Waiting on you
 Somewhere out there
 
 Somewhere in there, in your heart tonight
 Where I have never gone
 You are not alone
 And it's tearing me all apart alright
 But girl what can I do
 When I'm so far from you
 
 And when I lay me down to sleep
 My one and only prayer is you'll keep
 Safe from harm until I get
 Wherever you are
 Somewhere out there
 
 If you're sad, if you're lonely
 If you're scared, if you're only
 Tired of fightin'
 Seekin' shelter
 Just hold on I'm
 Somewhere out there
 
 Somewhere out there in the world tonight
 Just out of your reach
 You'll hear my heart beat
 
 I went downtown, it was just to ease my pain
 I went downtown, it was just to ease my pain
 I ended up out walkin' in the rain
 I took my pistol and a hundred dollar bill
 I took my pistol and a hundred dollar bill
 I had everything I need to get me killed
 
 Southside gals, they suit me just fine
 Southside gals, they suit me just fine
 As long as I got money they don't whine
 
 Now the devil lives on Lewis Street I swear
 Yeah the devil lives on Lewis Street I swear
 I seen him rockin' in his rockin' chair
 
 I start way up top of Lewis Street
 I walk down to the end
 I start way up top and I walk down to the end
 I'm goin' way down in the bottoms
 I come back up again
 
 Now Mama told me, Papa too
 They both talked til they turned blue
 But I got them ol' South Nashville blues again
 I won't be satisfied until they lock me up again
 
 My baby sparkle and shine
 Sparkle and shine
 Sparkle and shine
 My baby sparkle and shine
 And everyone knows she's fine
 She blesses all that she sees
 A toss of her hair and a kiss in the breeze
 But she don't love no one but me
 And I can't believe she's mine
 
 Shimmering she moves
 Sunlight all around her
 Even when she's blue
 Silver clouds surround her
 
 My baby sparkle and shine
 Sparkle and shine
 Sparkle and shine
 My baby sparkle and shine
 And I can't believe she's mine
 
 My baby swings down the street
 Big tall high heel shoes on her feet
 Walks by and my heart skips a beat
 And I'm stumblin' like a fool
 She give me somethin' so sweet
 I can't sleep y'all and I can't eat
 Sparks fly whenever we meet
 I'm breathless 'cause she's so cool
 
 Anywhere she goes
 I can only follow
 She'll be there I know
 When I awake tomorrow
 
 My baby sparkle and shine
 Sparkle and shine
 Sparkle and shine
 My baby sparkle and shine
 And everyone knows she's fine
 
 My baby sparkle and shine
 Sparkle and shine
 Sparkle and shine
 My baby sparkle and shine
 And everyone knows she's fine
 
 And everyone knows she's mine
 
 You know that it's been such a long time, honey 
 Since I've been ridin' next to you 
 I ain't a-waitin' in no long line, honey 
 You know I'm only passin' through 
 
 Well, I got here without warning 
 Well, I'm leavin' in the mornin' 
 You won't find me hangin' round your door tomorrow like your other men 
 Hey darlin', squeeze me in 
 
 I've been sleepin' by the road side, honey 
 Holdin' my suitcase next to me 
 You can't ignore me cause it's been tried, honey 
 I'm gonna get you, wait and see 
 
 Darlin', squeeze me in
 
 New jersey turnpike ridin' on a wet night
 'neath the refinery's glow, out where the great black rivers flow
 License, registration, I ain't got none, but I got a clear conscience
 'bout the things that I done
 Mister state trooper please don't stop me...
 
 Maybe you got a kid maybe you got a pretty wife, the only thing that I got's been botherin' me my whole life
 Mister state trooper please don't stop me
 
 In the wee, wee hours your mind get hazy, radio relay towers lead me to my baby
 Radio's jammed up with talk show stations
 It's just talk, talk till you lose your patience
 Mister state trooper please don't stop me
 
 Hey somebody out there, listen to my last prayer
 Hi ho silver-o deliver me from nowhere
 
 One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
 And I won't have to drag this weight around
 When there ain't no hunger
 And there ain't no pain
 Then I won't have to swing this thing
 One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
 
 One of these nights I'm gonna sing a different tune
 All night long beneath the silvery moon
 When the war is over
 And the union's strong
 Won't sing no more angry songs
 One of these nights I'm gonna sing a different tune
 
 Someday when my struggle's through
 I won't have to strive
 Until then all I can do
 Is let my hammer fly
 
 One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
 Leave my burden restin' on the ground
 When the air don't choke ya and the ocean's clean
 And kids don't die for gasoline
 One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
 
 John Henry was a mighty man
 Worked his whole life long
 When he made that hammer ring
 He always sang this song
 
 One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
 And I won't have to drag this weight around
 When there ain't no hunger
 And there ain't no pain
 Then I won't have to swing this thing
 One of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
 
 Yeah, one of these days I'm gonna lay this hammer down
 
 I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' round
 Hangin' up my highway shoes
 Lately when I walk they make a hollow sound
 And they carry me away from you
 Every night I lay my body down
 My empty arms just leave me blue
 So I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round
 And find my way back home to you
 
 I have always been the travelin' kind
 A million miles behind me now
 I kept on followin' that thin white line
 But now I want to turn around
 I only lived to hear that highway sound
 High and lonesome - low and blue
 Now I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round
 And find my way back home to you
 
 So say goodbye to all my ramblin' pals
 Ol' Highway Dave and Southside Sue
 I don't believe they'll miss me anyhow
 What's one less wayward soul or two
 Down the road they'll pass the jug around
 And they'll sing them lonesome highway blues
 But me I'm thinkin' 'bout givin' up this ramblin' 'round
 And find my way back home to you 
 
 Lately I got worry and woe on my mind
 I been thinkin' 'bout leavin' my trouble behind
 Something's callin' and I follow it down
 Past the darkness on the edge of town
 I'll be rollin' down a sunset highway
 
 Heard about it in a dream or was it a song
 Out West where I'll be free or maybe I'm wrong
 Doesn't matter 'cause it's too late now
 Made my mind up ain't no stoppin' me now
 I'm rollin' down a sunset highway
 I'm rollin' down a sunset highway
 
 Ain't no reason or rhyme for the things that I've done
 Just a matter of time and it's finally come
 Tell the boys that I wish them the best
 Nothin' ever lasts wherever I guess
 And I'm rollin' down a sunset highway
 I'm rollin' down a sunset highway
 I'm rollin' down a sunset highway
 
 I'm a pretty big man around this town
 I got me the hottest little Chevy around
 Sweet little '66
 
 She got a yellow front fender and a gray one on the back
 But my income tax is comin' and I'm gonna paint her black
 Sweet little '66
 
 She got the 396, she got the four on the floor
 Those stickers in the window ain't just for show
 My sweet little '66
 
 Now old Bubba and me built her back in '79
 Then he went into the army so now she's all mine
 Sweet little '66
 
 I used to run her down on river road, make a little dough
 Can't afford another ticket so I'm laying kinda low
 Oh, me and my '66
 
 She got the 396, she got the four on the floor
 Those stickers in the window ain't just for show
 My sweet little '66
 
 Now she ain't too good on gasoline, she burns a little oil
 But she was built by union labor on American soil
 Sweet little '66
 
 Oh, when your Subaru is over and your Honda's history
 I'll be blastin' down on back road with my baby next to me
 In my sweet little '66
 
 She got the 396, she got the four on the floor
 Those stickers in the window ain't just for show
 My sweet little '66
 
 She got the 396, she got the four on the floor
 And those stickers in the window ain't just for show
 My sweet little '66
 
 My sweet little '66
 My sweet little '66
 My sweet little '66
 
 I went down to Taneytown
 I went down to Taneytown
 To see what I could see
 
 My mama told me never go
 I'm damn near twenty two years old
 Sometimes I fear this holler swallow me
 
 She ran off to Gettysburg
 Went off with that new beau of hers
 I snuck off after dark
 
 It's a long way down the county road
 The stars were bright and the moon was low
 Down to where the black top highway starts
 
 I went down to Taneytown
 I went down to Taneytown
 I went down to see what I could see
 
 Now everybody stared at me
 You'd think that they ain't never seen
 A colored boy before
 
 Well they chunked at me and called me names
 They'd have whopped me sure but the sheriff came
 I slipped off ran through the dry goods store
 
 I ran down Division Street
 Some of them boys followed me
 Down to the railroad track
 
 There's four of them and I can't fight
 But I had my old Randall knife
 I cut that boy and I never did look back
 
 I went down to Taneytown
 I went down to Taneytown
 I went down to see what I could see
 
 Cross the fields and woods I run
 Like a bullet from a rabbit gun
 Back home to my bed
 
 Now Ma came in from Gettysburg
 Her and that new beau of hers
 "Boy you look like hell"; alls she said
 
 A month went by without a word
 Somebody down the holler heard
 About that boy they hung
 
 He begged those men to spare his life
 But I dropped my bloody Randall knife
 He picked it up so they thought he was the one, yeah
 
 I went down to Taneytown
 I went down to Taneytown
 I ain't goin' back there anymore
 
 The name she gave was Caroline
 A daughter of a miner
 And her ways were free
 It seemed to me
 That sunshine walked beside her
 
 She came from Spencer
 Across the hill
 She said her pa had sent her
 'Cause the coal was low
 And soon the snow
 Would turn the skies to winter
 
 She said she'd come
 To look for work
 She was not seeking favors
 And for a dime a day
 And a place to stay
 She'd turn those hands to labor
 
 Ah, but the times were hard, Lord
 The jobs were few
 All through Tecumseh valley
 But she asked around
 And a job she found
 Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's
 
 She saved enough to get back home
 When the spring replaced the winter
 But her dreams were denied
 Her pa had died
 The word come down from Spencer
 
 She took to whorin' out on the streets
 With all the lust inside her
 And many a man
 Returned again
 Just to lay himself beside her
 
 They found her down beneath the stairs
 That lead to Gypsy Sally's
 In her hand when she died
 Was a note that cried
 "Fare thee well
 Tecumseh Valley"
 
 My brother Jimmy, my other brother Jack
 Went off down to Houston and they never come back
 Mama wasn't gonna let her baby go yet
 But there ain't nobody hirin' back in Lafeyette
 
 I'm workin' all week for the Texaco check
 Sun beatin' down on the back of my neck
 Tried to save my money but Jimmy says no
 Says he's got a little honey on Telephone Road
 
 Come on, come on, come on, let's go
 This ain't Louisiana
 Your Mama won't know
 Come on, come on, come on, let's go
 Everybody's rockin' out on Telephone Road
 
 Telephone Road's ten miles long
 Fifty car lots and a hundred honky-tonks
 Jukebox blastin' and the beer bottles ring
 Jimmy banging on a pinball machine
 
 Come on, come on, come on, let's go
 This ain't Louisiana
 Your Mama won't know
 Come on, come on, come on, let's go
 Everybody's rockin' out on Telephone Road
 
 Mama never told me about nothin' like this
 I guess Houston's 'bout as big as a city can get
 Sometimes I get lonesome for Lafeyette
 Someday I'm goin' home but I ain't ready yet
 
 Come on, come on, come on, let's go
 This ain't Louisiana
 Your Mama won't know
 Come on come on come on let's go
 Everybody's rockin' out on Telephone Road
 
 Come on, come on, come on, let's go
 This ain't Louisiana
 Your Mama won't know
 Come on, come on, come on, let's go
 Everybody's rockin' out on Telephone Road
 
 Drama down in Egypt, pharaoh's fit to fight
 Talkin' 'bout the trouble with the Israelites
 How I'm supposed to build this monument of mine
 If I can't keep the monoliths moving down the line
 
 Tell Moses, tell him go
 Say the children of Israel are suffering so
 Tell Moses, tell him true
 You gotta lead them where the pharaoh won't be following you
 
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Keep on traveling on
 
 Selma, Alabama, 1965
 Gotta stick together if you're gonna to stay alive
 Riot gear and tear gas, sheriff's on the edge
 Waiting with an army over yonder 'cross the bridge
 
 Tell Martin, tell him go
 Say the governor's in Montgomery and you gotta let him know
 Tell Martin, tell him now
 He's been up on the mountain and he's got to show us how
 
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Keep on traveling on
 
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 
 Ferguson, Missouri, people in the streets
 Hands above their head standing up to the police
 Waiting for a hero to step into the breach
 'Ain't nobody coming so it's up to you and me
 
 Tell Mary, tell John
 Say the hourglass is empty and the judgment day has come
 Tell preacher, farmer Brown
 Say Joshua's blown his trumpet and the walls are comin' down
 Tell sister, brother too
 Tell them where they're gonna meet us and what we're gonna do
 Tell Steven, tell Shawn
 There's a message in the music, everybody sing along
 
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Water is wide, milk and honey on the other side
 Keep on traveling along
 
 Sunset in my mirror, pedal on the floor
 Bound for New York City and I won't be back no more
 Won't be back no more, boys won't see me around
 Goodbye guitar town
 
 Ghosts out on the highway, voices on the wind
 Tellin' me that we may never pass this way again
 Voices on the highway angels beckonin'
 Like a long lost friend
 
 Fare thee well I'm bound to roam
 This ain't never been my home
 
 Stranger in my mirror, lines around my eyes
 String around my finger but I don't remember why
 Don't remember why, boys don't remember how
 Goodbye guitar town
 
 Fare thee well I'm bound to roam
 This ain't never been my home
 
 Blue dog on my floorboard, redhead by my side
 Cross the mighty Hudson River to the New York City side
 Redhead by my side, boy's sweetest thing I've found
 Goodbye guitar town
 
 My Grandaddy was a railroad man 
 When I was young he took me by the hand 
 Dragged me to the station at the break of dawn 
 Said "boy I got to show you somethin' 'fore it's gone" 
 She was blue and silver, she was right on time 
 We rode that Texas Eagle on the Mopac line 
 
 We had some sandwiches that Granma packed 
 We rode to Palestine and hitchhiked back 
 Home in time for supper with a tale to tell 
 That night I dreamed I heard that lonesome whistle wail 
 
 When I got old enough to take the train alone 
 I rode that Texas Eagle down to San Antone 
 
 Nowadays they don't make no trains 
 Just the piggyback freighters and them Amtrak things 
 They shut the Eagle down awhile ago 
 Sold it to the railroad down in Mexico 
 But every now and then that whistle's on my mind 
 I ride that Texas Eagle cross the borderline
 
 Nothin' ever comes from outta nowhere
 Ain't nobody ever rides for free
 There's a hundred million heartaches out there
 In between the devil and the deep blue sea
 And all the troubles of the wide world flow
 Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
 Here it comes again
 Ready or not
 Worry and pain?
 That all you got?
 That all you got?
 
 Good lord wasn't playin' honey
 The day that he invented New Orleans
 And there ain't no amount of blood or money
 Ever gonna wash the pavement clean
 But everybody on the night shift knows
 Might as well keep on dancin' till the next wind blows
 Gonna spoil my day
 Give it your best shot
 Another hurricane?
 That all you got?
 That all you got?
 
 Bon temps roulet
 No matter what
 Holler fee nah nay
 That all you got?
 That all you got?
 
 
 The first time I laid eyes on you
 I checked myself right out of this world
 One thing will bring me back from this heart attack
 And that's your sweet lovin', girl
 
 Ooh, your huggin' and kissin'
 Mmm, made my lights come on
 You put the crush on me
 Little girl, can't you see I'm gone
 
 And now I ain't gonna listen to reason
 There's no excuse for the way that I feel
 Before one word was spoke
 I knew it was no joke
 Baby, this love is real
 
 They say you gotta take time to know her
 But I can't wait that long
 You put the crush on me
 Little girl, can't you see I'm gone
 
 You put the crush, crush
 My mouth turns to mush
 I can't begin to speak of all of your charms
 You put the crush, crush
 Ooh, what a rush
 Now, I can't be satisfied until I'm wrapped up in your arms
 
 Ain't that some kind of love, babe
 You know I'm not puttin' you on
 You put the crush on me
 Little girl, can't you see I'm gone
 
 You put the crush, crush
 My mouth turns to mush
 I can't begin to speak of all of your charms
 You put the crush, crush
 Ooh, what a rush
 Now, I can't be satisfied until I'm wrapped up in your arms
 
 Ain't that some kind of love, babe
 You know I'm not puttin' you on
 You put the crush on me
 Little girl, can't you see I'm gone
 
 About the time that Daddy left to fight the big war 
 I saw my first pistol in the general store 
 In the general store, when I was thirteen 
 Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen 
 
 So l asked if I could have one someday when I grew up 
 Mama dropped a dozen eggs, she really blew up 
 She really blew up, I didn't understand 
 Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 
 The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
 Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 
 My very first pistol was a cap and ball Colt 
 Shoot as fast as lightnin' but she loads a might slow 
 Loads a might slow, soon found out 
 It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out 
 
 So then I went and bought myself a Colt 45 
 Called a peacemaker but I never knew why 
 Never knew why, I didn't understand 
 Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 
 The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
 Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
 Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 
 Well I get into a card game in a company town 
 Caught a miner cheating, I shot the dog down 
 Shot the dog down, watched the man fall 
 Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw 
 
 The trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed 
 Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said 
 Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man 
 Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
 
 The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
 Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand 
 The devil's right hand, the devil's right hand 
 Nothing touched the trigger but the devil's right hand
 Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand
 
 Well, I'm cuttin out a firebreak line
 Cuttin out a firebreak line
 Digging down deep to the clay and lime
 Cuttin out a firebreak line
 
 Well I'm a wildfire fighting fool
 From the Yellow mountain hotshot crew
 I can swamp and fell
 I can walk through
 I'm an EMT and a torchman too
 When the wind's blowin hot and dry
 And the sparks and the cinders fly
 I'll make my stand with 20 good men
 A better band of brother's you'll never find
 I got their back and they got mine
 Cuttin out a firebreak line
 
 Well, I'm cuttin out a firebreak line
 Cuttin out a firebreak line
 Digging down deep to the clay and lime
 Cuttin out a firebreak line
 
 Ed Pulaski is a friend of mine
 When I'm cuttin out a firebreak line
 He invented this thing like an axe I swing
 And he never left a member of his crew behind
 When the fire jumped across the line
 Took em down an abandoned mine
 Then he drew his gun, said he'd shoot the first one
 That got it in his head to try and step outside
 Got everybody out alive
 Cuttin out a firebreak line
 
 Well, I'm cuttin out a firebreak line
 Cuttin out a firebreak line
 Digging down deep to the clay and lime
 Cuttin out a firebreak line
 
 Gotta pray that the wind'll die
 And it rains down from on high
 Let's raise a glass to the hotshots past
 In hotshot heaven up above the sky
 Lookin down on me when I'm
 Cuttin' out a firebreak line
 
 Well the first time I saw you
 You sat back in the corner
 You had seven men waiting on you
 I recall tellin' myself, girl
 Lord, look at all of them fools
 Then you walked over to me
 And the lightning went through me
 When those big brown eyes looked into mine
 Tonight when your fools come a-callin'
 Honey, I'll be the first fool in line
 
 I'm a fool for you darlin'
 And your sweet love keeps callin'
 I just can't get you off my mind
 Tonight when your fools come a-callin'
 I'll be the first fool in line
 
 I don't know what's got into me
 But the way that you do me
 There ain't no use in strugglin', I can tell
 I just can't believe this is me, girl
 Fallin' all over myself
 Well, I tried hard to fight it
 But I started to like it
 And we both know that that's the last sign
 Tonight when your fools come a-callin'
 Honey, I'll be the first fool in line
 
 I'm a fool for you darlin'
 And your sweet love keeps callin'
 I just can't get you off my mind
 Tonight when your fools come a-callin'
 I'll be the first fool in line
 I said tonight when your fools come a-callin'
 Well I'll be the first fool in line
 
 Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk 
 Of a day-I-ay-I-ay 
 I met a little girl and we stopped to talk 
 Of a fine soft day-I-ay-I-ay 
 And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?
 'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
 And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl 
 'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl 
 
 We were halfway there when the rain came down 
 Of a day-I-ay-I-ay 
 She asked me up to her flat downtown 
 Of a fine soft day-I-ay-I-ay 
 And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?
 'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue 
 I took her hand and I gave her a twirl 
 And I lost my heart to a Galway girl 
 
 When I woke up I was all alone 
 With a broken heart and a ticket home 
 And I ask you now, tell me what would you do 
 If her hair is black and her eyes were blue 
 I've traveled around, I've been all over this world 
 Boys, I ain't never seen nothin' like a Galway girl
 
 There's a girl up on the mountain I once knew
 I let her go and now I'm sad and blue
 But sometimes late at night I pray
 She'd come down to me some day
 But the girl up on the mountain never knew
 
 So she gave herself to someone else back then
 Thought I'd never see her face again
 I found a new love of my own
 Broke my heart and now she's gone
 But the girl up on the mountain still remain
 
 I wish I may, I wish I might
 Won't every star see the night
 A million diamonds up above
 Shine down on the one I love
 
 The poets have a thousand tales to tell
 Oh, the battle of love it didn't work out well
 And me I sleep out right tonight
 'Cause here my dream'll hold up tight
 But the girl up on the mountain's up at still
 Oh, and I love her now, guess I always will
 
 I work the graveyard shift - stay up all night long 
 You'll wake up someday 
 And find your good gal gone 
 If you don't treat your baby right 
 She'll come see me 
 Some lonely night 
 
 When the sun goes down 
 And the moon is gone 
 That's when I come around 
 Don't you think I won't 
 
 On the graveyard shift, stay up all night long 
 You'll wake up someday 
 And your good gal gone 
 
 I drive a Cadillac, rides just like a dream 
 All the pretty gals 
 Want to ride with me 
 'Cause I got what all the women want 
 I never say I do 
 When I really don't
 
 Beggin' your pardon there stranger
 You look like you're new to this town
 We're a long way away from the beach here
 You won't see many gringos around
 Well I come from West Colorado
 And I've wandered this world far and wide
 I've lived for some years in the shadows
 And my eyes are unused to this light
 If you buy me a strong drink of whiskey
 I will tell you the tale of my life
 It's long and it's sad but it fits me
 And it may bring a tear to your eye
 
 All the men of my family were solidiers
 The hard fightin' straight talkin' kind
 When my turn came all that was over
 But I'd already made up my mind
 I was there when we blew though Grenada
 And I still have to ask myself why
 Then we took down that fool Noriega
 That's where I caught the good colonel's eye
 Well he asked me if I loved my country
 And before I had time to reply
 He regaled me with tales of past glories
 I believed every one of his lies
 
 So I left my old life behind me
 Turned my back on my family and friends
 And I did everything that they asked me
 And I lost some sleep now and again
 And I lived like a thief and assassin
 I smuggled their poisons sometimes
 Until I asked the wrong question in passin'
 
 And the colonel himself dropped the dime
 So if you're ever in west Colorado
 Tell the folks in Durango goodbye
 There's a price on my head and I can't go
 So I'll just wait around here 'til I die
 
 Come and gather 'round me people
 And a tale to you I'll tell
 Of my father and his father
 In the days before the spill
 With an endless sky above 'em
 And a restless sea below
 And every blessin' flowing from the Gulf of Mexico
 
 Well my Granddad worked the shrimp boats
 From the time that he was grown
 And he scrimped and saved and bought himself
 A trawler of his own
 He was rough and he was ready
 And he drank when he was home
 But he made his family's livin' on the Gulf of Mexico
 
 He was rollin'
 He was rollin'
 'Cross the deep blue water
 He was rollin'
 
 Well my Daddy drove a crew boat
 Haulin' workers to the rigs
 He was sick of mendin' nets
 And couldn't stand the smell of fish
 So he drew a steady paycheck
 Twenty years from Texaco
 When he died we spread his ashes
 On the Gulf of Mexico
 
 He was rollin'
 He was rollin'
 'Cross the deep green water
 He was rollin'
 
 As for me I dreamed of nothing
 Any grander than the day
 That I stepped out on the drillin' floor
 To earn a roughneck's pay
 Then one night I swear I saw the devil
 Crawlin' from the hole
 And he spilled the guts of hell out in the Gulf of Mexico
 
 We were rollin'
 We were rollin'
 'Cross the blood-red water
 We were rollin'
 
 Tell me a story 'bout a fella with a crazy dream 
 Everybody tells him that it won't amount to anything 
 He fires the shot heard around the world 
 He wins the prize and he gets the girl 
 That's the kind of story I like, the kind that makes you think 
 
 Sing me a song about a cowboy with an achin' heart 
 Ridin' along the lonesome prairie 'bout to fall apart 
 Every time those doggies moan 
 He doesn't feel so all alone 
 That's the kind of song that I like, the kind that breaks your heart 
 
 Paint me a picture of a girl with a secret smile 
 Lookin' back at ya 'cross the years through ancient eyes 
 You're standin' there like an open door 
 Cause she's seen it all before 
 That's the kind of picture I like, the kind that makes you sigh
 
 The old gunfighter on the porch
 Stared into the sun
 And relived the days of living by the gun
 When deadly games of pride were played
 And living was mistakes not made
 And the thought of the smell of the black powder smoke
 And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
 
 Ah, the smell of the black powder smoke
 And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
 
 It's always keep your back to the sun
 He can almost feel the weight of the gun
 And he's faster than snakes or the blink of an eye
 And it's a time for all slow men to die
 And his eyes get squinty and his fingers twitch
 As he empties the gun at the son of a bitch
 And he's hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
 And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
 
 Hit by the smell of the black powder smoke
 And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
 
 Now the burn of a bullet is only a scar
 He's back in his chair in front of the bar
 And the streets are empty and the blood's all dried
 And the dead are dust and the whiskey's inside
 So buy him a drink and lend him an ear
 'Cause he's nobody's fool and the only one here
 Who remembers the smell of the black powder smoke
 And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
 
 Remember the smell of the black powder smoke
 And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
 
 He said I stood in that street before it was paved
 Learned to shoot or be shot before I could shave
 And I did it all for the money and fame
 Noble was nothing but feeling no shame
 And nothing was sacred but stayin' alive
 And all that I learned from a Colt 45
 Was to curse the smell of the black powder smoke
 And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
 
 Curse the smell of the black powder smoke
 And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
 
 He's just an old man, now, that no one believes
 That says he's a gunfighter, the last of the breed
 And there are ghosts in the street seeking revenge
 Calling him out to the lunatic fringe
 Now he's out in the traffic checking the sun
 And he's killed by a car as he goes for his gun
 So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
 And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
 
 So much for the smell of the black powder smoke
 And the stand in the street at the turn of a joke
 
 Travelin' now
 On the low highway
 Three thousand miles
 To the Frisco Bay
 
 Cross the rivers wild
 And the lonesome plains
 Up the coast and down
 And back again
 
 Saw empty houses on a dead end street
 People linin up for something to eat
 And the ghost of America watching me
 Through the broken windows of the factories
 
 Pickin bones of a better day
 As I roll on the down the low highway
 
 Travelin' now
 On the low highway
 By the yellow moon
 And the light of day
 
 From the snow white crown
 Of the mountain tall
 To the valley down
 Where the shadows fall
 
 Met a man with a rifle in his hand
 Been away to battle in a distant land
 Taught him to hate taught him to kill
 Now he's out on the road with a hole to fill
 
 Nobody knows the price he paid
 So he takes his toll on the low highway
 
 Travelin' now
 On the low highway
 Windows down
 Listenin
 
 Wheels turnin round
 On the asphalt sayin
 Every sound
 Is a prophecy
 
 Heard and old man grumble and a young girl cry
 Brick wall crumble and the white dove fly
 And a cry for justice and a call for peace
 Force of reason in the roar of the beast
 
 And every mile is a prayer I prayed
 As I roll down
 The low highway
 
 I was born on this mountain a long time ago
 Before they knocked down the timber and strip-mined the coal
 When you rose in the mornin' before it was light
 To go down in that dark hole and come back up at night
 
 I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home
 She holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
 Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
 But i'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home
 
 I was young on this mountain but now i am old
 And i knew every holler, every cool swimmin' hole
 'til one night i lay down and woke up to find
 That my childhood was over and i went down in the mine
 
 There's a hole in this mountain and it's dark and it's deep
 And god only knows all the secrets it keeps
 There's a chill in the air only miners can feel
 There're ghosts in the tunnels that the company sealed
 
 I woke up this morning and I took a look around at all that I got 
 These days I've been lookin' in the mirror and wondering if that's me lookin' back or not 
 I'm still the apple of my mama's eye 
 I'm my daddy's worst fears realized 
 Here of late all this real estate don't seem all that real to me sometimes 
 
 I'm back out on that road again 
 Turn this beast into the wind 
 There are those that break and bend 
 I'm the other kind, I'm the other kind 
 
 Now my old buddy, what's his name, says, "Man what the hell are you thinkin' 'bout 
 Fool, you got two of everything, but you hang your head just like you was down and out"; 
 And I'm damn sure not suffering from a lack of love 
 There's plenty more where that came from 
 Ah - but leave it up to me to say something wrong and hurt someone before I'm done 
 
 You see it used to be I was really free 
 I didn't need no gasoline to run 
 Before you could say Jack Kerouac you'd turn your back and I'd be gone 
 Yeah nowadays I got me two good wheels and I seek refuge in aluminum and steel 
 Aw, it takes me out there for just a little while 
 And the years fall away with every mile
 
 When I'm sad and blue
 And I'm feeling all alone
 There's a place that I go to
 That no one knows
 
 Where no matter what I do
 Won't nobody put me down
 That's why I'm going to
 The other side of town
 
 On the other side of town
 Where the sun don't ever shine
 Everybody walks around
 With a shadow cross their minds
 
 When that midnight train rolls by
 And they hear that lonesome sound
 They just hang their heads and cry
 On the other side of town
 
 Well it isn't very far
 And it's not that hard to find
 You just follow all the other lonely souls
 Take a walk down lonesome lane
 'Til you see the dead end sign
 And your broken heart will tell you where to go
 
 To the other side of town
 Where the sun don't ever shine
 Everybody walks around
 With a shadow cross their minds
 
 When that midnight train rolls by
 And they hear that lonesome sound
 They just hang their heads and cry
 On the other side of town
 
 So if you've find someone
 Who won't ever let you down
 Hurry home before the sun goes down
 No matter what you do
 Don't let night fall like a shroud
 And catch you on the other side of town
 
 On the other side of town
 Where the sun don't ever shine
 Everybody walks around
 With a shadow cross their minds
 When that midnight train rolls by
 And they hear that lonesome sound
 They just hang their heads and cry
 On the other side of town
 
 The old man loaded up everything that he owned 
 On a wagon and headed out west 
 The old woman fearlessly faced the unknown 
 Cause she figured he knew what was best 
 And they settled down hard on a government grant 
 With six mouths to feed and forty acres to plant 
 
 And the rain came down 
 Like an angel come down from above 
 And the rain came down 
 It'll wash you away and there ain't never enough 
 
 Fall turned to winter another year gone 
 Over and over again 
 Some took their lives from their land and moved on 
 And some stayed on to plow it back in 
 And the good Lord he giveth and he taketh away 
 And the restless shall go and the faithful shall stay 
 
 Now my grandaddy died in the room he was born in 
 Twenty-three summers ago 
 But I could have sworn he was beside me this morning 
 When the sheriff showed up at my door 
 So don't you come around here with your auctioneer man 
 Cause you can have the machines but you ain't taking my land
 
 I was walkin' down the street
 In the town where I was born
 I was movin' to a beat
 That I'd never felt before
 So I opened up my eyes
 And I took a look around
 I saw it written 'cross the sky
 The revolution starts now
 Yeah, the revolution starts now
 
 The revolution starts now
 When you rise above your fear
 And tear the walls around you down
 The revolution starts here
 Where you work and where you play
 Where you lay your money down
 What you do and what you say
 The revolution starts now
 Yeah the revolution starts now
 
 Yeah the revolution starts now
 In your own backyard
 In your own hometown
 So what you doin' standin' around?
 Just follow your heart
 The revolution starts now
 
 Last night I had a dream
 That the world had turned around
 And all our hopes had come to be
 And the people gathered '??round
 They all brought what they could bring
 And nobody went without
 And I learned a song to sing
 The revolution starts now
 
 I was eight years old when my granddaddy died 
 He that showed me the signs I still miss him sometimes 
 Been a long time ago but his words still ring true 
 Whatever you do be a seeker 
 
 All these years I have wandered and wherever I roamed 
 I was never alone or forsaken I know 
 Somewhere way out yonder I know I will find 
 That a bright beacon shines for a seeker 
 
 You can't always believe your eyes 
 It's your heart that sees through all the lies 
 And the first answer follows the first question asked 
 The mystery unmasked by the seeker 
 
 In a world full of sorrow, hunger and pain 
 It's so hard to explain why I'm still travelin' 
 But there's a new day tomorrow and maybe I'll hold 
 Something brighter than gold to a seeker
 
 On Mardi Gras day the Tennessee kid
 Awoke in a puddle
 Of his own worst fears
 Haunted by the ghost
 Of vague remembrance
 No corporeal beast he could name
 So the kid invoked Lucifer himself
 With oaths most grievously discourteous
 And charged him submit
 Forthwith to atone
 At the crossroads
 Celebrated in song
 Come on
 
 Up jumped the devil
 In the middle of the thoroughfare
 'Who dares to utter my most secret name?'
 He roared
 But the kid yielded not so much as an inch
 To uncertainty
 Steadfast he rejoined the enemy in kind
 'Old patch then, Satan, Mephistopheles,
 Beelzebub
 By any other name you ain't nothin'
 Like a rose'
 Then he girded his loins for the
 Ensuing onslaught
 But the devil only shrugged and the kid
 Shuddered when he hissed he said
 
 Hey hey hey hey
 Hey hey hey hey
 Hey hey hey hey
 The balance comes due someday
 
 Wait just one goddamn minute cried the kid
 From the cumberland
 You never mention nothin'
 'Bout no kinda note
 Just said, sign here, it's just a soul
 You'll never miss it
 I ain't set foot in a church since I was just
 A little ol' thang
 Reckoned I was headed straight to hell
 By the highway
 No matter how long and how hard
 That I prayed
 So I might as well learn how to make
 This guitar talk
 Somebody said ol' Bob Johnson
 Came down this way
 And Devil say
 
 Hey hey hey hey
 Hey hey hey hey
 Hey hey hey hey
 When the balance comes due someday
 
 And the monster raised himself up
 To the fullness of his stature
 Black wings eclipsing a sanguine
 Mississippi moon
 Behold behemoth the trampler
 Of infidels,
 He who sweeps away nations
 With a flick of his tail
 Theopolis, Agrrippa, Faustus, Paganini
 Lurid and long is the tale of my prey
 Question not the ironclad bond
 Of my surety
 Set down here in blood
 In your very own hand
 
 And the Tennessee kid cast an eye
 On the list where his mark
 Was indeed clearly inscribed
 And he fell to his knees
 But it was too late to pray
 And with his very last breath he did say
 
 Hey hey hey hey
 Hey hey hey hey
 Hey hey hey hey
 The balance comes due someday
 
 In the blue of the evening when the sun is low 
 There's a shadow that creeps across my cell block floor 
 And it comes to remind me what I'm in here for 
 
 No, I'm not admittin' that I done the crime 
 I'm only getting down to doin' time 
 The passin' of day is no concern of mine 
 
 There's a guard on the second shift comes on at three 
 And he's always about a half inch off of me 
 Like he needs to keep remindin' me that I'm not free 
 
 God forgive him 'cause he doesn't see 
 He's no less a prisoner 'cause he holds a key 
 And God forbid he turn his back on me 
 
 For every wall you build around your fear 
 A thousand darker things are born in here 
 There fed on contempt for all that you hold dear 
 
 The truth is it doesn't matter what you do 
 'Til you gaze in that mirror with an eye that's true 
 And admit that what scares you is the me in you
 
 In the middle of the night
 In the middle of a lonely night
 Stands alone in the pale moonlight
 Screams out in defiance
 
 He's got no one to turn to
 You could talk 'til you turn blue
 He'd just turn his back on you
 Ain't no compromising
 
 Because he's totally untamed
 No fear of the unnamed
 Ah man but he'll take the blame
 Someone's gotta do it, someone's got to
 
 Yeh now he's out on the highway
 He's got the key and the right of way
 Tank is full and his toll's paid
 Hellbound and determined
 
 Yeah he run a dangerous payload
 When he comes to the crossroads
 Ah, man it's all timed to explode
 You'll just see the sky burnin'
 
 Because he's totally untamed
 No fear of the unnamed
 Yeh man but he'll take the blame
 Someone's gotta do it, someone's got to
 
 Now he's standin' at hell's door
 With a bad attitude and a forty-four
 The devil said, "What's up man
 Now what you come here for?"
 
 He said, "Man, let's just get to it"
 He said, "I always heard that you were the bad one
 There's a few places I ain't been, a few things I ain't done
 You got your pitchfork and I got my gun"
 Someone's gotta do it
 
 Because he's totally untamed
 No fear of the unnamed
 Yeh man but he'll take the blame
 Someone's gotta do it
 
 Because he's totally untamed
 Yeah no fear of the unnamed
 Stand up like man, take all the blame
 'Cause someone's gotta do it, someone's got to
 Someone's gotta do it
 Someone's gotta do it
 Totally untamed
 
 It's late in the evening
 Just about to lay down
 What's that at your backdoor
 Did you hear a strange sound, girl?
 
 Honey I just saw your light
 Here I come baby
 It's the usual time of the night
 
 I can't help but want you
 Ever since I known ya
 I would never hurt you
 I don't want to own you
 
 Girl, I just want to hold you tight
 Here I come baby
 It's the usual time of the night
 
 I know you don't love me
 I know you don't need me
 If you ever want me
 Just hit on your back porch light
 At the usual time of the night
 
 Now I been down to Texas
 I been to New Orleans
 I was born a rambler
 You are gonna haunt my dreams
 Any time the wound gets right
 Here I come baby
 It's the usual time of the night
 
 I know you don't love me
 I know you don't need me
 If you ever want me
 Just leave on your back porch light
 At the usual time of night
 
 Here I come
 Here I come baby
 
 Look at ya 
 Yeah, take a look in the mirror now tell me what you see 
 Another satisfied customer in the front of the line for the American dream 
 I remember when we was both out on the boulevard 
 Talkin' revolution and singin' the blues 
 Nowadays it's letters to the editor and cheatin' on our taxes 
 Is the best that we can do 
 Come on 
 
 Look around 
 There's doctors down on Wall Street 
 Sharpenin' their scalpels and tryin' to cut a deal 
 Meanwhile, back at the hospital 
 We got accountants playin' God and countin' out the pills 
 Yeah, I know, that sucks '??'?? that your HMO 
 Ain't doin' what you thought it would do 
 But everybody's gotta die sometime and we can't save everybody 
 It's the best that we can do 
 
 Four score and a hundred and fifty years ago 
 Our forefathers made us equal as long as we can pay 
 Yeah, well maybe that wasn't exactly what they was thinkin' 
 Version six-point-oh of the American way 
 But hey we can just build a great wall around the country club 
 To keep the riff-raff out until the slump is through 
 Yeah, I realize that ain't exactly democratic, but it's either them or us and 
 And it's the best we can do 
 
 Yeah, passionely conservative 
 It's the best we can do 
 
 Conservatively passionate 
 It's the best we can do 
 
 Meanwhile, still thinkin' 
 Hey, let's wage a war on drugs 
 It's the best we can do 
 Well, I don't know about you, but I kinda dig this global warming thing...
 
 I got out of work and I headed for the neighborhood beer joint 
 I sat around and had a beer with the boys like I always do 
 Well I didn't have nothin' to say anyway there ain't no point 
 There's just something 'bout a Monday that always makes me blue 
 
 Well it was well after dark so I knew my wife and kids were waitin' 
 And I guess I took a left where I generally take a right 
 Well I filled her up with gas, checked the oil at the Texaco station 
 I threw the car seat in the dumpster and headed off into the night 
 
 Woo-ohh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
 There's somethin' 'bout a Monday that always makes me blue 
 
 Well I headed south on thirty five hell bent for vinyl 
 I hadn't never had her up past fifty five before 
 Well somethin' 'bout that little red line always looked so final 
 Buddy you'd be surprised how fast a Chevrolet truck can go 
 
 * Now, down in Mexico they've got a little place called Boystown 
 Where a man's still a man if you know what I'm talkin' about 
 Well, I walked into the Cadillac bar and I laid my cash down 
 I said "There's plenty more where that came from"; and the lights went out 
 
 *  
 Well I woke up in a county jail 'cross the line in Laredo 
 With a headache and a deputy staring at me through the door 
 Well he said "Now how you got across that river alive, I don't know 
 But your wife just made your bail so now you're really dead for sure"
 
 Now my wife, she called my boss and cried so I got my job back 
 And the boys down at the plant, they whisper and stare at me 
 Yea well my wife can find a lot of little jobs to keep me on the right track
 
 You're here, you're gone 
 I'm still hangin' on 
 This game ain't nothin' new 
 
 You've changed your mind 
 So many times 
 I'm still in love with you 
 I'll think it over when you're walkin' out the door 
 Why'd you go and leave me sad and blue?
 
 And if you knew 
 What I go through 
 You'd think it over too 
 
 I hope someday 
 I'll find a way 
 I'll walk right out on you 
 
 Till that day comes 
 I'm still the one 
 If you should need a fool
 
 I'll think it over when you're walkin' out the door 
 Why'd you go and leave me sad and blue?
 
 And if you knew 
 What I go through 
 You'd think it over, you'd think it over, you'd think it over too
 
 This city won't wash away
 This city ever drown
 Blood in the water and hell to pay
 Sky tear open and pain rain down
 Doesn't matter 'cause come what may
 I ain't ever gonna leave this town
 This city won't wash away
 This city won't ever drown
 
 Ain't the river or the wind to blame
 Every around here knows
 Nothin' holdin' back Ponchartrain
 Except for a prayer and a promise's ghost
 We just carry on diggin' our graves
 In solid marble above the ground
 Maybe our bones'll wash away
 But this city won't ever drown
 
 This city won't ever die
 Just as long as her heart beats strong
 Like a second line steppin' high'
 Raisin' hell as we roll along
 Gently to the Vieux Carre
 Lower Nine, Central City, Uptown
 Singin' Jacamo Fee-Nah-Nay
 This city won't ever drown
 Doesn't matter 'cause there ain't no way
 I'm ever gonna leave this town
 This city won't wash away
 This city won't ever drown
 
 I'm running down this highway 
 Don't remember where I slept last night 
 I just remember halfway through the night 
 I woke up stiff with fright 
 I dreamed there was no asphalt 
 I dreamed there was no gasoline 
 Felt like a rat caught in some nowhere town 
 I woke up and screamed 
 
 This highway 
 This highway 
 This highway 
 This highway 
 This highway 
 This highway's mine 
 
 I grew up on the dragstrip 
 I used to shut em down 
 I used to take their pinkslips 
 There's a sucker born in every town 
 I never showed no mercy 
 I blew them all away 
 They stood there and cursed me 
 As I towed their lives away 
 
 I used to run the cocaine 
 I used to run the weed 
 These days I'm just running 
 Tryin' to make this highway bleed 
 Sometimes the only difference 'tween me and this machine 
 Is I run on desperation 
 She runs on gasoline 
 
 I'm the Roadmaster 
 The Asphalt Blaster 
 Mess with me and I'll shut you down 
 The bad thing 
 The highway king and I've come to claim my kingdom now
 
 Turn around and look at how far we've come
 Two hearts beatin' like a single drum
 Said you'd never lie and I promised I'd never run
 Forever wasn't just another word back then
 We swore we'd stay together ever after, thick and thin
 Now this is how it ends
 
 Guess I should have seen it comin' from the start
 Comes to love then fallin' is the easy part
 Everybody told me you were only gonna break my heart
 Been around this lonely world and back again
 From the time I found myself a lover and a friend
 Now this is how it ends
 
 This is how it ends
 If you'd only told me back then
 You wouldn't find me in the shape I'm in
 Just another fool to trust you again
 
 A fairytale they tell about a love so strong
 Flowin' like a river rollin' on and on
 Come around the bend and I looked around but you were gone
 Never saw it comin' but you can't pretend
 The line between a secret and a lie ain't razor thin
 Now this is where it ends
 
 This is how it ends
 Hand me down dress on a wasted day
 Ring in the pocket of a vest of gray
 That's the way a cheatin' song begins
 This is how it ends
 
 Time has come today 
 Young hearts can go that way 
 Can't put it off another day 
 I don't care what others say 
 They say we don't listen anyway 
 Time has come today 
 The rules have changed today 
 I have no place to stay 
 Thinking about the subway 
 The love has flown away 
 My tears have come and gone 
 Oh my Lord, I have to roam 
 I have no home 
 I have no home 
 Now the time has come 
 No place to run 
 I might get burned up by the sun 
 But I had my fun 
 I've been loved and put aside 
 I've been crushed by tumbling tide 
 And my soul has been psychedelicized 
 Now the time has come 
 There are things to realize 
 Time has come today 
 Time has come today 
 Time
 
 Won't say I love you, babe
 Won't say I need you, babe
 But I'm gonna' get you, babe
 And I will not do you wrong
 Living's mostly wasting time
 And I waste my share of mine
 But it never feels too good
 So let's don't take too long
 Well, you're soft as glass and I'm a gentle man
 We got the sky to talk about
 And the world to lie upon
 
 Days up and down they come
 Like rain on a conga drum
 Forget most, remember some
 Oh, but don't turn none away
 Everything is not enough
 Nothing is too much to bear
 Where you've been is good and gone
 All you keep is the getting there
 Well, to live's to fly, all low and high
 So shake the dust off of your wings
 And the sleep out of your eyes
 
 It's goodbye to all my friends
 It's time to leave again
 Here's to all the poetry
 And the picking' down the line
 I'll miss the system here
 The bottom's low and the treble's clear
 But it don't pay to think too much
 On things you leave behind
 Well, I may be gone, but it won't be long
 I'll be bringing back the melody
 And the rhythm that I find
 
 We all got holes to fill
 Them holes are all that's real
 Some fall on you like a storm
 Sometimes you dig your own
 The choice is yours to make
 Time is yours to take
 Some dive into the sea
 Some toil upon the stone
 Well, to live's to fly awe low and high
 So shake the dust off of your wings
 And the sleep out of your eye
 Oh, shake the dust off of your wings
 And the tears out of your eye
 
 I was born in a dump
 Mama died and my daddy got drunk
 Left me here to die or grow
 In the middle of Tobacco Road
 
 Grew up in a rusty shack
 All I had was hangin' on my back
 Only you know how I loathe
 This place called Tobacco Road
 
 But it's home, the only life I've ever known
 Only you know how I loathe
 
 Tobacco Road
 Gonna leave, get a job
 With the help and the grace from above
 Save some money, get rich and old
 Bring it back to Tobacco Road
 
 Bring dynamite and a crane
 Blow it up, start all over again
 Build a town, be proud to show
 Give the name of Tobacco Road
 
 But it's home, the only life I've ever known
 Only you know how I loathe Tobacco Road
 
 But it's home, the only life I've ever known
 Only you know how I loathe
 Tobacco Road
 
 Everyone in Nacadoches knew Tom Ame's would come to some bad end 
 Well the sheriff had caught him stealin' chickens and such 
 By the time that he was ten 
 
 And one day his daddy took a ten dollar bill 
 And he tucked it in his hand 
 He said I can tell you're headed for trouble son 
 And your momma wouldn't understand 
 
 So he took that money and his brothers old bay 
 And he left without a word of thanks 
 Fell in with a crowd in some border town 
 And took to robbing banks 
 
 Well outside the law your luck will run out fast 
 And a few years came and went 
 'Till he's trapped in an alley in Abilene 
 With all but four shells spent 
 
 And he realized praying was the only thing 
 That he hadn't ever tried 
 Well he wasn't sure he knew quite how 
 But he looked up to the sky 
 
 Said you don't owe me nothing and as far as I know 
 Lord don't owe nothing to you 
 And I ain't asking for a miracle Lord 
 Just a little bit of luck will do 
 
 And you know I ain't never prayed before 
 But it always seemed to me 
 If praying is the same as begging Lord 
 I don't take no charity 
 
 Yeah but right now Lord with my back to the wall 
 Can't help but recall 
 How they nearly hung me for stealing a horse 
 In Fort Smith Arkansas 
 
 Judge Parker said guilty and the gavel came down 
 Just like a cannon shot 
 And I went away quietly 
 And I began to file and plot 
 
 Well they sent the preacher down to my cell 
 He said the Lord is your only hope 
 He's the only friend that you gonna have 
 When you hit the end of Parker's rope 
 
 Well I guess he could of kept on preaching till Christmas 
 But he turned his back on me 
 I put a home made blade to that golden throat 
 And asked the deputy for the key 
 
 Well it ain't the first close call I ever had 
 As I'm sure you already know 
 I had some help from you Lord and the devil himself 
 It's been strictly touch and go 
 Yeah but who in the hell am I talking to 
 There ain't no one here but me 
 And then he cocked both his pistols and he spit in the dirt 
 And he walked out in the street
 
 Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
 Hang your head and cry;
 You killed poor Laurie Foster,
 And you know you're bound to die.
 You left her by the roadside
 Where you begged to be excused;
 You left her by the roadside,
 Then you hid her clothes and shoes.
 
 Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
 Hang your head and cry;
 You killed poor Laurie Foster,
 And you know you're bound to die.
 
 You took her on the hillside
 For to make her your wife;
 You took her on the hillside,
 And ther you took her life.
 
 You dug the grave four feet long
 And you dug it three feet deep;
 You rolled the cold clay over her
 And tromped it with your feet.
 
 Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
 Hang your head and cry;
 You killed poor Laurie Foster,
 And you know you're bound to die.
 
 "Trouble, oh it's trouble
 A-rollin' through my breast;
 As long as I'm a-livin', boys,
 They ain't a-gonna let me rest.
 
 I know they're gonna hang me,
 Tomorrow I'll be dead,
 Though I never even harmed a hair
 On poor little Laurie's head."
 
 Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
 Hang your head and cry;
 You killed poor Laurie Foster,
 And you know you're bound to die.
 
 "In this world and one more
 Then reckon where I'll be;
 If is wasn't for Sheriff Grayson,
 I'd be in Tennesee.
 
 You can take down my old violin
 And play it all you please.
 For at this time tomorrow, boys,
 Iit'll be of no use to me."
 
 Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
 Hang your head and cry;
 You killed poor Laurie Foster,
 And you know you're bound to die.
 
 "At this time tomorrow
 Where do you reckon I'll be?
 Away down yonder in the holler
 Hangin' on a white oak tree.
 
 Hang your head, Tom Dooley,
 Hang your head and cry;
 You killed poor Laurie Foster,
 And you know you're bound to die.
 
 In the darkest hour of the longest night 
 If it was in my power I'd step into the light 
 Candles on the alter, penny in your shoe 
 Walk upon the water transcendental blues 
 
 Happy ever after 'til the day you die 
 Careful what you ask for, you don't know 'til you try 
 Hands are in your pockets, starin' at your shoes 
 Wishin' you could stop it transcendental blues 
 
 If I had it my way, everything would change 
 Out here on this highway the rules are still the same 
 Back roads never carry you where you want 'em to 
 They leave you standin' there with them ol' transcendental blues
 
 Well, the clouds didn't look like cotton, they didn't even look like clouds
 I was underneath the weather and all my friends looked a crowd
 The swimmin' hole was full of rum, I tried to find out why
 All I learned was this my friend you gotta swim before you fly
 
 I got two girls one's in heaven, one's below
 One I love with all my heart and one I do not know
 
 Two lonesome dudes on an ugly horse passed by not long ago
 They asked me where the action was and I said I did not know
 As they disappeared into the brush I heard the driver say
 He's a little slow between the ears, he's always been that way
 
 I got two girls one's in heaven, one's below
 One I love with all my heart and one I do not know
 
 Now Jolly Jane just lays around and listens with her mouth
 She's had about a dozen husbands but the last one just pulled out
 Now, who's gonna bring her dinner through the weary years ahead?
 All she'll get from me is sympathy, ain't got time to see she's fed
 
 I got two girls one's in heaven, one's below
 One I love with all my heart and one I do not know
 
 And now it's cold down on the bayou and they say it's in your mind
 But my moccasins are treadin' ice leavin' strange designs
 The Cajuns say the last time that this happened they weren't here
 All Beaumont's full of penguins and I'm playin' it by ear
 
 I got two girls one's in heaven, one's below
 One I love with all my heart and one I do not know
 I got two girls one's in heaven, one's below
 One I love with all my heart and one I do not know
 
 Back in the hills when we were only kids
 Love shined like a diamond in your eyes
 I swore I'd never hurt you - then I did
 Now I'm all alone with all my lies
 I promised that I'd never be untrue
 I'd never make you cry
 The only promise that I didn't break
 Was to love you until the day I die
 
 I wish I'd never seen those city lights
 A sight for a country boy to see
 For every one that you see shinin' bright
 Another is burnin' out like me
 I wouldn't listen though you told me dear
 I couldn't see the lie
 But all the same I still love you tonight
 And I'll love you until the day I die
 
 They built this prison just for fools like me
 Who don't know a treasure from a stone
 I killed a man now I won't ever see
 The green rollin' hills where I was born
 No I won't ever see your face again
 But if I close my eyes
 I can almost hear you call me back to then
 And I'll love you until the day I die
 
 I come to you with empty hands
 I guess I just forgot again
 I only got my love to send
 On Valentine's Day
 
 I ain't got a card to sign
 Roses have been hard to find
 I only hope that you'll be mine
 On Valentine's Day
 
 I know that I swore that I wouldn't forget
 I wrote it all down, I lost it I guess
 There's so much I want to say
 But all the words just slip away
 
 The way you love me every day
 Is Valentine's Day
 
 If I could I would deliver to you
 Diamonds and gold; it's the least I can do
 So if you'll take my IOU
 I could make it up to you
 Until then I hope my heart'll do
 For Valentine's Day
 For Valentine's Day
 
 I grew up in a military town
 Waiting on the sky to fall
 Everybody I knew, hangin' around
 Wondering what to do
 When the draft board calls
 Looking back it musta have been a miracle now
 I ever grew up at all
 To sing about living in a military town
 Waitin' on the sky to fall
 Waitin' on the sky to fall, boys
 Waitin' on the sky to fall
 Chicken Little wasn't makin' nothing but noise?
 Waiting on the sky to fall.
 
 Spent a lonely lifetime
 Rollin' on down the line
 Searchin' for the holy grail
 Never once crossed my solitary mind
 That any such consecrated quest'd fail
 Come up upon an ocean and much to my chagrin
 They told me that ship had sailed
 Walkin' on the water, 'cause I never learned to swim
 Searchin' for the holy grail
 Searchin' for the holy grail, friends
 Searchin' for the holy grail
 Been across the ocean and now I'm back again
 Searchin' for the holy grail.
 
 Whoop
 
 Been around enough to know a little bit now
 And I am sitting on top of the world
 Wangin' on a guitar while the sun goes down
 And singin' a song about a redheaded girl
 Was a time I would have said them days was gone
 But, I'm givin' it another whirl
 Didn't know that I was gonna live this long
 Now, I'm sittin' on top of the world
 Sittin' on top of the world, y'all
 Sitting on top of the world
 Eyes wide open till the messenger calls
 Sittin' on top of the world!
 
 Here comes the night, day brings no light 
 For wrong or right I'm here waiting on you 
 Words cut too deep, old ghosts won't sleep 
 They'll never keep me from waiting on you 
 
 Breathing out, breathing in 
 Holding out, giving in 
 Doing with or without 
 For a lifetime, just a lifetime 
 
 I can't let go, I wait for you 
 Till hell goes cold, I'll wait for you 
 You're all I know and I wait for you 
 
 Breathing out, breathing in 
 Holding out, giving in 
 Doing with or without waiting on you 
 
 Don't show it all, walk on, walk tall 
 Behind this wall I'm still waiting on you
 
 Breathing out, breathing in 
 Holding out, giving in 
 Doing with or without 
 For a lifetime, just a lifetime 
 
 I can't let go, I wait for you 
 Till hell goes cold, I'll wait for you 
 You're all I know, I wait for you 
 I can't let go, I wait for you
 Till hell goes cold, I'll wait for you 
 You're all I know and I wait for you
 I can't let go, I wait for you
 Till hell goes cold, I'll wait for you 
 Wah, you're all I know and I wait for you
 
 When you're walkin' in LA
 Everybody knows that you're down
 Nobody walks anyway any other way in this lonesome town
 Nothin' separatin' you and the street
 But a dollar and the shoes on your feet
 
 And you're walkin' in LA
 When you're walkin' in LA
 When you're walkin' in LA
 
 When you're walkin' in LA
 Ain't nobody knows you're alive
 'Cause you're only as good in this city, they say, as the car you drive
 Rollin' by shiny and new
 And there's nothing that a poor boy can do
 
 When you're walkin' in LA
 When you're walkin' in LA
 When you're walkin' in LA
 
 18 wheelers roamin' by up on the 405
 Well, I ain't goin' anywhere
 'Cause I ain't got a ride
 
 When you're walkin' in LA
 Everybody passes you by
 Maybe glance up in the rearview mirror and say who's that poor guy
 Then you're starin' at the taillights again
 Of a Lexus or a Mercedes Benz
 
 When you're walkin' in LA
 When you're walkin' in LA
 When you're walkin' in LA
 
 Ladies and gentlemen, Johnny Bush
 
 Weekend warriors cruisin' up and down the boulevard
 Back to work on Monday mornin', think they got it hard
 
 When you're walkin' in LA
 You might as well lay down and die
 'Cause nothing's gonna be alright anyway no matter how hard you try
 And a pedestrian in Beverly Hills
 Ain't got any place to go but downhill
 
 When you're walkin' in LA
 When you're walkin' in LA
 When you're walkin' in LA
 
 When you're walkin' in LA
 When you're walkin' in LA
 When you're walkin' in LA
 
 When you're walkin' in LA! 
 
 Walking down death row
 I sang for three men destined for the chair
 Walking down death row
 I sang of lives and loves in other years
 Walking down death row
 I sang of hopes that used to be
 Through the bars
 Into each separate cell
 I sang for one and two and three
 "If you'd only only stuck together
 You'd not be here
 If you could've loved each other's lives
 You'd not be sitting here
 And if only this you could believe
 You still might, you might still be reprieved"
 
 Walking down death row
 I turned the corner and found to my surprise
 There were women there as well
 With babies in their arms before my eyes
 Walking down death row
 I tried once more to sing of hopes that used to be
 But the thought of that contraption down the hall
 Waiting for whole families
 One dozen, two, or three
 "If you'd only stuck together
 You'd not be here
 If you could've loved another's child as well as yours
 You'd not be sitting here
 And if only this you could believe
 You still might, you might still be reprieved"
 
 Walking down death row
 I concentrated, singing to the young
 I sang of hopes that flickered still
 I tried to mouth their many separate tongues
 Walking down death row
 I sang of life and love that still might be
 Singing, singing down death row
 To each separate human cell
 One billion, two, or three
 "If we'd only stick together
 We'd not be here
 If we could learn to love each other's lives
 We'd not be sitting here
 And if only this you would believe
 We still might, we might still be reprieved"
 
 I'm standin' on Jordan's shore
 Standin' on Jordan's shore
 And I ain't gonna worry anymore
 'Cause I'm standin' on Jordan's shore
 Gonna lay my purse aside
 Lay my purse aside
 'Cause my money's no good on the other side
 Gonna lay my purse aside
 Gonna carry my ol' banjo
 Carry my ol' banjo
 'Cause the devil won't follow wherever I go
 If I carry my ol' banjo
 
 Gonna play that shady grove
 Play that shady grove
 Make my pallet down soft and low
 Gonna play that shady grove
 
 Gonna play that soldier's joy
 Play that soldier's joy
 Flop-eared mule and the red-haired boy
 Gonna play that soldier's joy
 Gonna bile them cabbage down
 Bile them cabbage down
 'Cause the devil surely cannot stand that sound
 When I bile them cabbage down
 
 Gonna carry my ol' banjo
 Carry my ol' banjo
 From the mountain high to the valley low
 Gonna carry my ol' banjo
 Gonna carry my ol' banjo
 Carry my ol' banjo
 'Cause the devil won't follow wherever I go
 If I carry my ol' banjo
 
 This is the best time of the day?the dawn 
 The final cleansing breath unsullied yet 
 By acrid fume or death?s cacophony 
 The rank refuse of unchained ambition 
 And pray, deny me not but know me now, 
 Your faithful retainer stands resolute 
 To serve his liege lord without recompense 
 Perchance to fall and perish namelessly 
 No flag-draped bier or muffled drum to set 
 The cadence for a final dress parade 
 But it was not always thus?remember? 
 Once you worshipped me and named me a god 
 In many tongues and made offering lest 
 I exact too terrible a tribute 
 
 Take heed for I am weary, ancient 
 And decrepit now and my time grows short 
 There are no honorable frays to join 
 
 Only mean death dealt out in dibs and dabs 
 Or horror unleashed from across oceans 
 Assail me not with noble policy 
 For I care not at all for platitude 
 And surrender such tedious detail 
 To greater minds than mine and nimbler tongues 
 Singular in their purpose and resolve 
 And presuming to speak for everyman 
 
 Oh, for another time, a distant field 
 And there a mortal warrior?s lonely grave 
 But duty charges me remain until 
 The end the last battle of the last war 
 Until that ?morrow render unto me 
 That which is mine my stipend well deserved 
 The fairest flower of your progeny 
 Your sons, your daughters your hopes and your dreams 
 The cruel consequence of your conceit
 
 When you walk through the garden
 You gotta watch your back
 Well I beg your pardon
 Walk the straight and narrow track
 If you walk with Jesus
 He's gonna save your soul
 You gotta keep the devil
 Way down in the hole
 
 He's got the fire and the fury
 At his command
 Well you don't have to worry
 If you hold on to Jesus' hand
 We'll all be safe from Satan
 When the thunder rolls
 Just gotta help me keep the devil
 Way down in the hole
 
 All the angels sing
 'Bout Jesus' mighty sword
 And they'll shield you with their wings
 And keep you close to the Lord
 Don't pay heed to temptation
 For his hands are so cold
 You gotta help me keep the devil
 Way down in the hole
 
 Way down in the hole
 Way down in the hole
 Way down in the hole
 Way down in the hole
 
 There's a Vietnam Vet with a cardboard sign
 Sitting there by the left turn line
 The flag on his wheelchair flapping in the breeze
 One leg missing and both hands free
 
 No one's paying much mind to him
 The V.A. budget's just stretched so thin
 And now there's more coming back from the Mideast war
 We can't make it here anymore
 
 And that big ol' building was the textile mill
 That fed our kids and it paid our bills
 But they turned us out and they closed the doors
 'Cause we can't make it here anymore
 
 You see those pallets piled up on the loading dock
 They're just gonna sit there 'til they rot
 'Cause there's nothing to ship, nothing to pack
 Just busted concrete and rusted tracks
 
 Empty storefronts around the square
 There's a needle in the gutter and glass everywhere
 You don't come down here unless you're looking to score
 We can't make it here anymore
 
 The bar's still open but man it's slow
 The tip jar's light and the register's low
 The bartender don't have much to say
 The regular crowd gets thinner each day
 
 Some have maxed out all their credit cards
 Some are working two jobs and living in cars
 Minimum wage won't pay for a roof, won't pay for a drink
 If you gotta have proof just try it yourself Mr. C.E.O.
 See how far 5.15 an hour will go
 Take a part time job at one your stores
 I bet you can't make it here anymore
 
 And there's a high school girl with a bourgeois dream
 Just like the pictures in the magazine
 She found on the floor of the laundromat
 A woman with kids can forget all that
 
 If she comes up pregnant what'll she do
 Forget the career and forget about school
 Can she live on faith Live on hope?
 High on Jesus or hooked on dope
 When it's way too late to just say no
 You can't make it here anymore
 
 Now I'm stocking shirts in the Wal-Mart store
 Just like the ones we made before
 'Cept this one came from Singapore
 I guess we can't make it here anymore
 
 Should I hate a people for the shade of their skin
 Or the shape of their eyes or the shape I'm in
 Should I hate 'em for having our jobs today
 No I hate the men sent the jobs away
 
 I can see them all now, they haunt my dreams
 All lily white and squeaky clean
 They've never known want, they'll never know need
 Their shit don't stink and their kids won't bleed
 Their kids won't bleed in their damn little war
 And we can't make it here anymore
 
 Will I work for food, will I die for oil
 Will kill for power and to us the spoils
 The billionaires get to pay less tax
 The working poor get to fall through the cracks
 
 So let 'em eat jellybeans let 'em eat cake
 Let 'em eat shit, whatever it takes
 They can join the Air Force or join the Corps
 If they can't make it here anymore
 
 So that's how it is, that's what we got
 If the president wants to admit it or not
 You can read it in the paper, read it on the wall
 Hear it on the wind if you're listening at all
 Get out of that limo, look us in the eye
 Call us on the cell phone tell us all why
 
 In Dayton Ohio or Portland Maine
 Or a cotton gin out on the great high plains
 That's done closed down along with the school
 And the hospital and the swimming pool
 
 Dust devils dance in the noonday heat
 There's rats in the alley and trash in the street
 Gang graffiti on a boxcar door
 We can't make it here anymore
 
 I was born in the city 
 I was born in the city 
 And I was raised up right around here 
 
 Daddy's down in the workhouse 
 Daddy's down in the workhouse 
 Daddy's down in the workhouse 
 Mama say ain't no way he's coming back here 
 
 Went to school with some rich kids 
 Went to school with some rich kids 
 Went to school with some rich kids 
 Bussed me half way across town 
 
 Call us white trash and no count 
 Call us white trash and no count 
 Call us white trash and no count 
 Say there wasn't no use in me staying round 
 
 I'm goin' down to the corner 
 I'm goin' down to the corner 
 I'm goin' down to the corner 
 Don't you wait for me to come in 
 
 Nothin' happens till midnight 
 Nothin' ever happens till midnight 
 Nothin' happens till midnight 
 The boys get restless bout then 
 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning 
 And I don't know what I'm gonna do 
 
 I got a razor in my pocket 
 I got a razor in my pocket 
 I got a razor in my pocket and 
 I got a pistol hid down by the school 
 
 Lord get me out of West Nashville 
 Lord get me out of West Nashville 
 Lord get me out of West Nashville 
 Lord get me out of West Nashville
 
 All you wanted was a one night stand
 The fire of the wine and the touch of a man
 But I fell in love and ruined all of your plans
 What'll you do about me
 Imagine the faces on your high class friends
 When I beat on the door and I beg to come in
 Screamin' "come on love me again"
 What'll you do about me
 
 You can change your number you can change your name
 You can ride like hell on a midnight train
 That's alright mama, that's o.k.
 But what'll you do about me
 
 Picture your neighbors when you try to explain
 That good ol' boy standin' out in the rain
 With his nose on the window pane
 Lady, what'll you do about me
 What in the world are you plannin' to do
 When a man comes over just to visit with you
 And I'm on the porch with a 2'X2'
 Tell me what'll you do about me
 
 You can call your lawyer you can call the fuzz
 You can sound the alarm - wake the neighbors up
 Ain't no way to stop a man in love
 What'll you do about me
 
 All you wanted was a one night stand
 The fire of the wine and the touch of a man
 But I fell in love and baby here I am
 What'll you do about me
 You can change your number you can change your name
 You can ride like hell on a midnight train
 That's alright mama, that's o.k.
 But what'll you do about me
 
 Dear Graciela, I'm writin' this letter 
 Deep in the night and I'm all alone 
 It's nearly breakin' my heart to tell you 
 I'm so far away from home 
 I know I said I'd never cross the border 
 I know I promised to return to you 
 But I lost my job in the maquiladora 
 What's a simple man to do? 
 
 I met a man in Tijuana 
 Said he had a job for me to do 
 Standin' on a corner in San Diego 
 With a pocketful of red balloons 
 All I wanted was a little money 
 All I needed was a week or two 
 I never even saw the police comin' 
 What's a simple man to do? 
 
 Tell my mamma that I said I'm sorry 
 I know she didn't bring me up this way 
 Ask if she could light a candle for me 
 Pray that I'll come home someday 
 Oh Graciela, won't you please forgive me 
 I never meant to bring this shame to you 
 I lost my job in the maquiladora 
 What's a simple man to do?
 
 As I walk through
 This wicked world
 Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity.
 I ask myself
 Is all hope lost?
 Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?
 
 And each time I feel like this inside,
 There's one thing I wanna know:
 What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh
 What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?
 
 And as I walked on
 Through troubled times
 My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
 So where are the strong
 And who are the trusted?
 And where is the harmony?
 Sweet harmony.
 
 Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry.
 What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh
 What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?
 
 So where are the strong?
 And who are the trusted?
 And where is the harmony?
 Sweet harmony.
 
 Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me wanna cry.
 What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh
 What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh
 What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?
 
 Well, its 8 o'clock in Boise, Idaho 
 I'll find my limo driver 
 Mister, take us to the show 
 I done made some plans for later on tonight 
 I'll find a little queen 
 And I know I can treat her right. 
 
 What's your name, little girl? 
 What's your name? 
 Shouldn't you stay, little girl? 
 
 Won't you do the same?. 
 Back at the hotel 
 Lord we got such a mess 
 It seems that one of the crew 
 Had a go with one of the guests, oh yes 
 Well, the police said we can't drink in the bar 
 What a shame 
 Won't you come upstairs girl 
 And have a drink of champagne 
 
 What's your name, little girl? 
 What's your name? 
 Shouldn't you stay, little girl? 
 For there ain't no shame. 
 
 What's your name, little girl? 
 What's your name? 
 Shouldn't you stay, little girl? 
 
 What's your name, little girl? 
 What's your name? 
 Shouldn't you stay, little girl? 
 
 9 o'clock the next day 
 And I'm ready to go 
 I got six hundred miles to ride 
 To do one more show, oh no 
 Can I get you a taxi home 
 It sure was grand 
 When I come back here next year 
 I wanna see you again 
 
 What was your name, little girl? 
 What's your name? 
 Shouldn't you stay, little girl? 
 Well there ain't no shame 
 What was your name, little girl? 
 What's your name? 
 Shouldn't you stay, little girl? 
 Won't you do the same?
 
 We've all got wheels to take ourselves away
 We've got telephones to say what we can't say
 We've all got higher and higher every day
 Come on wheels take this boy away
 
 We're not afraid to ride, we're not afraid to die
 So come on wheels take me home today
 Come on wheels take this boy away
 
 Now when I feel my time is almost up
 And destiny is in my right hand
 I'll turn to him who made my fate so strong
 Come on wheels make this boy a man
 
 We're not afraid to ride, we're not afraid to die
 Come on wheels take me home today
 Come on wheels take this boy away
 Come on wheels take this boy away
 
 Late at night on some dark deserted highway 
 On my way to another lonesome town 
 I thought I might see the first light of a new day 
 As it lay like fool's gold on the ground 
 
 But whenever I'm feelin' low 
 I won't have to cry alone I know 
 'Cause you will answer when I call 
 If I soar above the clouds and then 
 I come crashin' back to earth again 
 You will catch me when I fall 
 All these years I've watched you trip and stumble 
 There were times that I feared that you were lost 
 But every tear that I dried after you tumbled 
 Comes to mind when I'm considerin' the cost 
 
 In my heart there's a place for you to run to 
 Anytime you're tired and hurt and blue 
 For my part I have only to remind you 
 You will find me waiting when you do 
 
 I'm going to Memphis on a midnight train
 I'm tired of all this Mississippi rain
 That delta lady broke my heart and soul
 I got the blues, I can't stay, I gotta go
 
 But when the morning comes
 She's gonna wonder where he good man has gone
 When the morning comes
 She's gonna know I was the one
 
 Ain't nothin' darker than a Mississippi night
 Especially when your baby ain't been treatin' you right
 The river keeps rollin' back down to the sea
 I'm gonna lose these Mississippi blues in Tennessee
 
 But when the morning comes
 She's gonna wonder where he good man has gone
 When the morning comes
 She's gonna know I was the one
 
 But when the morning comes
 She's gonna wonder where he good man has gone
 When the morning comes
 She's gonna know I was the one
 
 I'm going to Memphis on a midnight train
 I'm tired of all this Mississippi rain
 
 It's late at night
 You're all alone
 Pale moonlight
 Cold as stone
 Heart beats fast
 Time moves slow
 Strangers glance
 Does he know
 
 Where you gonna run to
 Where you gonna hide
 Where you gonna run to
 Where you gonna hide
 Where you gonna run to
 Where you gonna hide
 When the people find out
 That you lied
 
 They took you in, made you well
 They told you things, they never tell
 To pay the debt, you made em fools
 That's what you get, they trusted you
 When they run to the temple and find
 That the treasure's gone
 Do you think it's gonna be a cross
 They're gonna nail you on
 
 When will we be married Molly
 When will we be wed
 When will we be bedded in the same bed
 
 When will we be married Molly
 When will we be wed
 When will we be bedded in the same bed
 
 You have your eye on Jimmy
 Long Jimmy Lee
 You have your eye on Jimmy
 And a fine man he
 
 You have your eye on Jimmy
 But you'd better let him be
 Because when you go, Molly-O
 You'll be gone with me
 
 When will we be married Molly
 When will we be wed
 When will we be bedded in the same bed
 
 When will we be married Molly
 When will we be wed
 When will we be bedded in the same bed
 
 You have your eye on Johnny
 Thin Johnny Fee
 You have your eye on Johnny
 And a fine man he
 
 You have your eye on Johnny
 But you'd better let him be
 'Cause when you go, Molly-O
 You'll be gone with me
 
 When will we be married Molly?
 When will we be wed?
 When will we be bedded in the same bed?
 
 When will we be married Molly
 When will we be wed
 When will we be bedded in the same bed
 
 I made a black bow for your pretty head
 When will we be married Molly
 When will we be wed
 Made a black bow for your bonny head
 
 When will we be married Molly
 When will we be wed
 When will we be bedded in the same bed
 
 When will we be married Molly
 When will we be wed
 When will we be bedded in the same bed
 
 Where I lead me I will travel
 Where I need me I will call me
 I'm no fool, I'll be ready
 God knows I will be
 And in the meantime make a little money
 And buy a little mercy
 
 Met this morning, now he loves me
 Say's he loves me
 It must be easy, look around you
 All around you
 But you see the motion, you're not movin'
 You don't know how to hold on
 Just keep it loose
 Don't get excited, it'll pass before long
 
 Now one is goin' one is stayin'
 One is silent one is saying'
 Here's your coat, take care of yourself
 Sorry you're leavin'
 A little sad you're all I had
 Will you be returnin'
 
 The boys upstairs are gettin' hungry
 You can shout in the wind about how it will be
 Or you can clench your fist, shake your head
 And head to the country
 I got no doubt about it my friend
 That's where they'll find me
 That's where they're gonna find me
 
 Ask the boys down in the gutter
 Now they won't lie cause you don't matter
 The street's just fine if you're good and blind
 But it ain't where you belong
 Roll down your sleeves, pick up your money
 And carry yourself home
 Roll down your sleeves, pick up your money
 And carry yourself home
 
 Well I was born on a rainy day 
 With a dark cloud hangin' down low 
 Now it follows me wherever I go 
 There were days I've sworn that I'd blow away 
 With the cold wind chillin' my bones 
 Cause it follows me wherever I go 
 
 In the midnight hour when I'm all alone 
 There's a hurtin' deep down in my soul 
 And it follows me wherever I go 
 When the sun shines down on my heart it's gone 
 But there's another night comin' I know 
 Cause it follows me wherever I go 
 
 I could drink corn whisky 'til my brain goes soft 
 I could run this highway 'til my wheels come off 
 And these blues keep comin' around 
 And follow me down 
 
 Well one of these days I'm gonna leave this town 
 But I won't have to travel alone 
 Cause if follows me wherever I go 
 
 I want to go somewhere where I can't be found 
 And I won't have to carry this load 
 But it follows me wherever I go
 
 I'm goin out on the highway
 Listen to them big trucks whine
 I'm goin out on the highway
 Listen to them big trucks whine
 
 White freight liner
 Won't you steal away my mind
 Ah, New Mexico ain't bad, lord
 And the people there they treat you kind
 And the people there they treat you kind
 
 Well, it's bad news from houston
 Half my friends are dying
 Well, it's bad news from houston
 Half my friends are dying
 
 Ah, Lord, I'm gonna ramble
 Till I get back to where I came
 Ah, Lord, I'm gonna ramble
 Till I get back to where I came
 
 I'm goin out on the highway
 Listen to them big trucks whine
 I'm goin out on the highway
 Listen to them big trucks whine
 
 
 Lately I've been feeling a little uneasy so I run straight home to you 
 It's been cold as hell and you just can't tell what a girl might do 
 I made a whole lot of promises baby, but none of my dreams came true 
 And it's you that paid and I'm so afraid that I'm losing you 
 
 But you belong to me 
 You belong to me 
 You belong to me, me, baby, me 
 
 Now your mama said you could do better than me, baby I know that's true 
 But you believed me instead, every word I said, and I did too 
 Now every day's a little bit harder out there no matter what I do 
 Well I could carry the world on my shoulders girl long as I got you 
 
 But you belong to me 
 You belong to me 
 You belong to me, me, baby, me 
 You belong to me 
 You belong to me 
 You belong to me, me, baby, me 
 
 Well my shining armor is rusted and worn 
 There's a heart inside here entrusted and sworn to you 
 Just tell me baby what I need to do 
 I can win you over again if you want me to 
 
 But you belong to me 
 'Cause you belong to me, me, baby, me
 
 Well my shining armor is rusted and worn 
 There's a heart inside here entrusted and sworn to you 
 Just tell me baby what I need to do 
 I can win you over again if you want me to 
 
 But you belong to me 
 You belong to me, me, baby, me
 You belong to me, me, baby, me
 'Cause you belong to me, me, baby, me
 You belong to me, me, baby, me
 You belong to me, me, baby, me
 You belong to me, me, baby, me
 
 This evening when the sun goes down
 And you're pain'ted up and gone to town
 Won't be walkin' up and down and wonderin' where you are
 Used to sit up waitin' by the door
 I don't worry 'bout that anymore
 Like I used to 'cause it was before you broke my heart
 
 I used to be a happy guy
 Not too sad and never cry
 But then every lie you ever told me did it's part
 Then you come around and make amends
 Can you promise not to stray again
 And I always took you back and then you broke my heart
 
 I should have known you would never change
 My poor heart won't ever be the same
 All I can do is blame it on the moon again
 For a memory that never ends
 Of one evening gone forever when you broke my heart
 
 Days will pass, seasons come and go
 I expect no less than nothin' so
 I got nothin' left that I can
 Show for all my tears and pain
 But the emptiness it still remain
 And I'll never love again because you broke my heart 
 
 Moses went up to the mountain
 To see what he could see
 Well he come down talking 'bout a burning bush
 Says 'This is how it's gonna be'
 He's scared to death
 You know the rest
 
 Columbus went down to the ocean
 In 1492
 He said 'Boys, I'm looking for India
 But America will do'
 Sailed to the west
 You know the rest
 
 Davey Crockett went out to Texas
 To fight at the Alamo
 Old Will Travis never told him
 Texas is in Mexico
 It's a bloody mess
 You know the rest
 
 Robert Johnson went to the crossroads
 A guitar in his hands
 Well, the devil had him a guitar, too
 He says 'This is what you need man,
 You can be the best'
 You know the rest
 
 Well this song ain't got no reason
 Hell this song barely rhymes
 Well it come to me when I was asleep
 And it wakes me up sometimes
 I can't get no rest
 You know the rest
 
 I've been in love before
 I can't say I was really impressed
 So I ain't gonna anymore
 This time I'm gonna give it a rest
 Well if I see something good, I just might
 I never let my heart out at night
 So how'd you get to me
 You must have found the key
 You tear me up
 
 I tell you that I don't know
 But everybody knows that I do
 Swearing that I won't
 But girl, I wasn't counting on you
 I've built a wall around my heart
 So no little girl could tear it apart
 For all my running 'round
 The wall came tumbling down
 You tear me up
 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh what you do-ooh-ooh to me
 Whoa, I want some mo-ooh-re ooh-wee
 
 I call on the phone
 Just to know you're there on the line
 Well the way I carry on
 You'd think it was my very first time
 I can't believe I'm acting like this
 Oh, why'd you have to give me that kiss
 Little girl, you sure play rough
 I just can't get enough
 You tear me up
 
 Well little girl, you sure play rough
 I just can't get enough
 You tear me up...
 
 Got up this morning, you were on my mind, and you were on my mind
 I got some ache's and
 I got some pains and
 I got some wounds to bind
 
 Went to the corner just to ease my pain, it was just to ease my pain
 I got drunk and
 I got sick and
 I came home again
 
 I got a feelin', down in my shoes, it's way down in my shoes
 I got to move on
 I got to travel
 Walk away my blues
 
 Got up this morning, you were on my mind, and you were on my mind
 I got some ache's and
 I got some pains and
 I got some wounds to bind
 
 Maybe I'm a little bit lonely
 Maybe I'm a little bit blue
 Maybe I'm outta my mind and you don't
 Know me like you think that you do
 Maybe I had it comin'
 Maybe I wanted it all
 Maybe I was already out on the highway
 Runnin' when I heard you call
 
 You're right, I'm wrong
 I knew all along
 I'm wrong, you're right
 I miss you tonight
 
 What if I killed all that's holy
 What if I told you a lie
 What if you ended up believein' I only
 Ever meant to make you cry
 Every man only wants mercy
 Every woman only wants hope
 And every time I ever did wrong you forgave me
 And I wondered if I had enough rope
 
 You're right, I'm wrong
 I knew all along
 I'm wrong, you're right
 I miss you tonight
 
 Out past the edge of believein'
 Too late for turnin' back now
 I can still hear the door slam when I was leavin'
 And I'll always remember that sound
 Don't remember who pulled the lever
 Don't remember who made the call
 Maybe the truth is neither one of us ever loved anybody at all
 
 You're right, I'm wrong
 I knew all along
 I'm wrong, you're right
 I miss you tonight
 
 You're right, I'm wrong
 I knew all along
 I'm wrong, you're right
 I miss you tonight
 
 I've spent my life following things I cannot see
 But just when I catch up to them, they slip away from me
 Now I've been down a thousand trails I've never walked before
 And I found out that without fail, they lead me to your door
 
 And the world keep turning round and round
 It leaves me hanging in the air
 My heart keeps turning upside down
 You're still standin' there
 
 Now lately I see all the signs, I feel it in the wind
 And the same thing happens every time that you come back again
 Now I'll admit that there are nights when I sit up and cry
 But sometimes I turn out the lights and pray you'll pass me by
 
 And the world keep turning round and round
 It leaves me hanging in the air
 My heart keeps turning upside down
 And you're still standin' there
 
 Now since you've gone my empty arms have nothing left to hold
 And your memory cannot keep me warm but it never leaves me cold
 
 And the world keep turning round and round
 It keeps me hanging in the air
 My heart keeps turning upside down
 You're still standin' there
 
 And the world keep turning round and round
 It leaves me hanging in the air
 My heart keeps turning upside down
 You're still standin' there
 
 I've spent my life following things I cannot see

 You're still standin' there
 
 Hey baby let your hair hang down
 Hey baby let your hair hang down
 Falling like soft rain all around
 Hey honey put your lips on mine
 Hey honey put your lips on mine
 Smooth like silk and sweet like wine
 Never had another kiss taste like that
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 
 Hey baby whisper in my ear
 Hey baby whisper in my ear
 Way up close so I can hear
 Hey baby when you call my name
 Hey baby when you call my name
 The heavens shake and the angels sing
 And I know it's a sin but I want you bad
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 
 Hey baby won't you let me in
 Hey baby won't you let me in
 It's cold out here and I'm shiverin'
 Hey baby turn your light down low
 Hey baby turn your light down low
 Your mama and them and your man won't know
 Well it breaks my heart when you treat me bad
 But you're the best lover that I ever had
 
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 You're the best lover that I ever had
 
 Since you left me baby i've been true to you
 I don't run around with every gal in town
 The way i used to do
 I'm startin' over new
 Yours forever blue
 
 I wrote you a letter and every word was true
 I apologized for all my lies
 And the way i treated you
 Signed it "lonely fool"
 Yours forever blue
 
 Lately i've been hurtin' deep inside of me
 My poor heart's broke and every ragged stroke
 Brings back your memory
 Keeps me wantin' you
 Yours forever blue
 
 But i don't need no doctor to tell me what to do
 'bout this spell of yours 'cause there ain't no cure
 Even if i wanted to
 Can't get over you
 Yours forever blue
 
 If you ever want me you know what to do
 Just call my name 'cause i ain't ashamed
 To crawl on home to you
 If you want me to
 Yours forever blue
 
 I'm gonna buy myself a guitar
 Any kind'll do
 The only song i know play it soft and low
 While i moan the blues for you
 The whole night through
 Yours forever blue
