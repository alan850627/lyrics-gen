 Dime qui'n conoc'a
 Qu' era entonces la vida
 Andaba el mundo en plan de hallar la libertad
 Y rechazar lo que el mundo les impon'a
 
 Dime qui'n encend'a
 Toda esa rebeld'a
 Ruseau y Luther King, Sartre y Gagar'n
 Qu' es lo que me perd' cuando yo no exist'a?
 
 All' no fue mentira
 
 Sin miedos liberemos nuestros sue'os
 Y vamos a recorrer por eses tiempos
 
 Everybody needs an anchor
 A little something that makes you stay
 An incentive
 Someone to fight for
 Cause no one really needs so much space
 A couple years ago I was lonely
 I used to think that there was no God
 But then you looked at me with your blue eyes
 And my agnosticism turned into dust
 How well you know me
 That I don't care if the rest don't
 It doesn't matter to me, no
 As long as you love me
 As long as we still have each other
 
 I knew we had something
 From the moment I met you
 And I knew we had something
 No one thought it could be true
 Hey do you believe
 Do you believe in destiny?
 'Cause I do as I did then
 When you were only 23
 
 God knows that I'm a good dancer
 My feet can move to the music he plays
 But there were times I asked for an answer
 When he was acting in mysterious ways
 
 There were nights that I stayed up crying
 'Cause I was certain that things wouldn't change
 But then you came and I saw you smiling
 Just like an angel, so beautifully strange
 
 And then you touched me
 It's like you were made for me, oh
 Like it was all meant to be, oh
 And I was sure that you would love me
 And that we'd always have each other
 
 I knew we had something
 From the moment I met you
 And I knew we had something
 No one thought it could be true
 Hey, do you believe
 Do you believe in destiny?
 'Cause I do, as I did then
 When you were only 23
 
 Always thought that I was fine but I was wrong
 It was you, that one piece I was missing
 And I could do without you but it'd be no fun
 I found you and life was suddenly easy
 There ain't no worries now
 There ain't no feeling down
 
 I knew we had something
 From the moment I met you
 And I knew we had something
 No one thought it could be true
 Hey, do you believe
 Do you believe in destiny?
 'Cause I do, as I did then
 When you were only 23
 
 Debe ser el perfume que usas
 O el agua con la que te ba'as
 Pero cada cosita que haces
 A mi me parece una hazana
 
 Me besaste esa noche
 Cual si fuera el ultimo d'a de tu boca
 Cada que yo me acuerdo
 Yo siento en mi pecho el peso de una roca
 
 Son tus ojos marrones
 Con esa veta verdosa
 Es tu cara de ni'o
 Y esa risa nerviosa
 
 I'm addicted to you
 Porque es un vicio tu piel
 Baby I'm addicted to you
 Quiero que te dejes querer
 
 I'm addicted to you
 Porque es un vicio tu piel
 Baby I'm addicted to you
 Quiero que te dejes querer
 
 Por el puro placer de flotar
 
 Ahora si me lleva la corriente
 Ya no puedo dormir ni comer
 Como lo hace la gente decente
 
 Y tu recuerdo ha quedado
 As' como un broche prendido en mi almohada
 Y tu en cambio que tienes memoria de pez
 No te acuerdas de nada
 
 Son tus manos de hombre
 El olor de tu espalda
 Lo que no tiene nombre
 Lo logra tu mirada
 
 I'm addicted to you
 Porque es un vicio tu piel
 Baby I'm addicted to you
 Quiero que te dejes querer
 
 I'm addicted to you
 Porque es un vicio tu piel
 Baby I'm addicted to you
 Quiero que te dejes querer
 
 'Qu' ser' lo que fabricas t'?
 'Lo que te hace tan especial?
 Cuando hablo o pienso en t'
 Es imposible ser imparcial
 No es un da'o de la percepci'n
 Tampoco falta de sentido com'n
 Te haz vuelto todo y m's alla
 El mundo lo sabe, no es ning'n tab'
 
 Es tan irreal
 Lo que me hace extra'arte as' cuando no est's
 Lo que me hace idolatrarte as', es todo t'
 Estoy perdida, vivo anclada casi como un p'jaro a su cielo azul
 Te estimo
 
 Amarillo, me tienes en los bolsillos
 Morado, ya me olvid' del pasado
 En rojo, por que me sangran los ojos de llorarte
 Cuando no est's a mi lado
 Celeste, cu'steme lo que me cueste
 Dorado, por que no pienso perderte
 Tu amor es un arco iris de colores
 Y me muero por tenerte
 
 Es delicioso verte llegar
 Ver los efectos que causas, t'
 Con tu sonrisa angelical llenas la habitaci'n de luz
 Solo en ti encuentro satisfacci'n
 Hay tanto por descubrir a'n
 Es todo una dulce confusi'n
 Y tu piel es la plenitud
 
 Eres irreal
 Lo que me hace enamorarme cada d'a mas
 Lo que me hace adorarte as', es todo t'
 Estoy perdida, vivo anclada casi como un p'jaro a su cielo azul
 Te estimo
 
 Amarillo, me tienes en los bolsillos
 Morado, ya me olvid' del pasado
 En rojo, por que me sangran los ojos de llorarte
 Cuando no est's a mi lado
 Celeste, cu'steme lo que me cueste

 Tu amor es un arco iris de colores
 Y me muero por tenerte
 
 Es tan irreal
 Lo que me hace enamorarme cada noche m's
 Lo que me hace adorarte as', es todo t'
 Estoy perdida, vivo anclada casi como un p'jaro a su cielo azul
 Te estimo
 
 Why do all my friends now want to be your lovers?
 Your family got bigger when they thought you were rich
 And now like maniacs
 They scratch your back
 Even when it doesn't itch
 
 I want to figure it all
 I want to figure it all out
 I want to save you from
 Save you from all that's vain
 Save you from the things that cause us pain
 
 'Cause it's an animal city
 It's a cannibal world
 So be obedient, don't argue
 Some are ready to bite you
 
 It's an animal city
 It's a cannibal world
 So be obedient, don't argue
 Some are ready to bite you, my love
 
 They believe you now have everything you wanted
 And once you have become a star
 You've got no right to bitch
 But someday when you fail
 They'll put you on sale
 And buy you by the inch
 
 But you're the real deal
 And 'real' is your middle name
 You know, sometimes I feel
 Got to earn every breath we take, baby
 Never mind the rules we break
 
 'Cause it's an animal city
 It's a cannibal world
 So be obedient, don't argue
 Some are ready to bite you
 
 It's an animal city
 It's a cannibal world
 So be obedient, don't argue
 Some are ready to rip you right off
 
 With you I feel safe
 There's nothing to fear from us
 Away from the fangs, the fangs of the world
 I may be a coward, but you are brave
 And nothing seems so dangerous
 
 'Cause it's an animal city
 It's a cannibal world
 So be obedient, don't argue
 Some are ready to bite you
 
 It's an animal city
 It's a cannibal world
 So be obedient, don't argue
 Some are ready to rip you right off
 
 Cannibal world 
 Cannibal world
 Cannibal world
 Cannibal world
 So be obedient, don't argue
 Some are ready to bite you, my love
 
 Ven conf'a en mi
 No hay porque dejar
 Para hacer despu's
 Lo que quieras ya
 
 Es el instinto
 Deja que te sacuda
 El cielo es de los que creen
 Y no de los que dudan
 Soy un volc'n, en erupci'n
 Entra en raz'n, que suba el tel'n
 C'mara, acci'n 
 
 Esperar
 Es un mar
 Que a'n no s'
 Navegar
 No te quedes
 A'os luz, ya estoy decidida
 Y quiero saber si lo est's t'
 
 Ven conf'a en mi
 No hay margen de error
 Deja que en mi piel
 Brille tu sudor
 
 'Qu' es lo que esperas?
 Ya casi madrugada, mi cremallera
 No est' electrificada
 
 No me tengas m's consideraci'n
 Entra en raz'n, que suba el tel'n
 C'mara, acci'n 
 
 Esperar
 Es un mar
 Que a'n no s'
 Navegar
 No te quedes
 A'os luz ya estoy decidida
 Y quiero saber si lo est's t'
 
 Subir' por tu espalda la seda
 Como en el muro la entredadera
 Cuando se besen la luna y la arena
 Nadie nos mira esta noche es nuestra
 No habr' testigos no habr' evidencia
 Somos solamente yo y tu conciencia
 
 'Qu' es lo que esperas?
 'Qu' es lo que esperas?
 
 No me tengas m's consideraci'n
 Entra en raz'n, que suba el tel'n
 C'mara, acci'n 
 
 Esperar
 Es un mar
 Que a'n no s'
 Navegar
 No te quedes
 A'os luz, ya estoy decidida
 Y quiero saber si lo est's
 
 Esperar
 Es un mar
 Que a'n no s'
 Navegar
 No te quedes
 A'os luz ya estoy decidida
 Y quiero saber si lo est's t'
 
 T'
 T'
 T'
 T'
 T'
 T'
 T'
 T'
 T'
 T'
 
 No act'es tan extra'o
 Duro como una roca
 Si te mostr' pedazos de piel
 Que la luz del sol a'n no toca
 Y tantos lunares que ni yo misma conoc'a
 Te mostr' mi fuerza bruta
 Mi tal'n de Alquiles, mi poes'a
 
 Que har's solo una historia m's
 Que har' si no te vuelvo a ver
 Oh, oh
 
 Si desde el d'a en que no est's
 Vi la noche llegar mucho antes de las seis
 Si desde el d'a en que no est's
 Vi la noche llegar mucho antes de las seis
 Mucho antes
 
 No dejes el barco
 Tanto antes de que zarpemos
 Hacia alguna isla desierta
 Y despu's, despu's veremos
 Si me ves desarmada
 Porque lanzas tus misiles
 Si ya conoces mis puntos cardinales
 Los m's sensibles y s'tiles
 
 Que har's la vida lo dir'
 Que har' si no te vuelvo a ver
 Oh, oh
 
 Si desde el d'a en que no est's
 Vi la noche llegar mucho antes de las seis
 Si desde el d'a en que no est's
 Vi la noche llegar mucho antes de las seis
 
 Mucho antes de las seis
 
 Ah, ah, ah
 
 Mucho antes de las seis
 
 Mucho antes
 
 Para amarte 
 Necesito una raz'n
 Y es dif'cil creer 
 Que no exista una m's que este amor
 
 Sobra tanto
 Dentro de este coraz'n
 Que a pesar de que dicen que los a'os son sabios
 Todav'a se siente el dolor
 
 Porque todo el tiempo que pas' junto a ti
 Dej' tejido su hilo dentro de m'
 
 Y aprend' a quitarle al tiempo los segundos
 T' me hiciste ver el cielo a'n m's profundo
 Junto a ti creo que aument' m's de tres kilos
 Con tus tantos dulces besos repartidos
 
 Desarrollaste mi sentido del olfato
 Y fue por ti que aprend' a querer los gatos
 Despegaste del cemento mis zapatos
 Para escapar los dos volando un rato
 
 Pero olvidaste una final instrucci'n
 Porque a'n no s' c'mo vivir sin tu amor
 
 Y descubr' lo que significa una rosa
 Me ense'aste a decir mentiras piadosas
 Para poder verte a horas no adecuadas
 Y a reemplazar palabras por miradas
 
 Y fue por ti que escrib' m's de cien canciones
 Y hasta perdon' tus equivocaciones
 Y conoc' m's de mil formas de besar
 Y fue por ti que descubr' lo que es amar
 Lo que es amar
 
 I'd rather dance in the air
 than lie on the ground.
 I'd rather my open my ears
 than shut out the sound.
 Travel to the ends of the Earth
 and tell you what I found.
 
 I rather kneel down and pray 
 than scream at the sun.
 Prefer to know than
 to hide from my skeletons.
 I don't want to sit down and cry 
 while watching others run. 
 
 If I missed the bus more than once,
 I'm not the only one.
 Don't wanna wait around 
 for things to come to me.
 'Cause when my hands are tied, 
 they struggle to be free.
 And if they steal my eyes, 
 I'll find a new way to see.
 
 The world's forever turning, 
 and there's a thought that never stops burning.
 If I'm pounding at your door, 
 it's because I'm here to ask for more.
 The world's forever turning, 
 and there's a thought that never stops burning. 
 If I'm pounding at your door, 
 it's because I'm here to ask for more.
 
 Prefer a thousand hello's
 to just one goodbye.
 Prefer the pain of the truth 
 to a pretty lie.
 Listen to the words in my head,
 although they may not rhyme.
 Listen to the voice in my heart, 
 somedays it's so sublime.
 Don't wanna wait around 
 for things to come to me.
 'Cause when my hands are tied, 
 they struggle to be free. 
 And if they steal my eyes, 
 I'll find a new way to see.
 
 The world's forever turning, 
 and there's a thought that never stops burning.
 If I'm pounding at your door, 
 it's because I'm here to ask for more.
 The world's forever turning, 
 and there's a thought that always burning. 
 If I'm pounding at your door, 
 it's because I'm here to ask for more.
 
 Back in black
 I hit the sack
 I've been too long I'm glad to be back 
 Yes, I'm let loose
 From the noose
 That's kept me hanging about
 I've been looking at the sky
 'Cause it's gettin' me high
 Forget the hearse 'cause I never die
 I got nine lives
 Cat's eyes
 Abusin' every one of them and running wild
 
 'Cause I'm back
 OH Yes, I'm back
 Yes, I'm back
 Well, I'm back, back
  I'm back in black
 Yes, I'm back in black
 
 Back in the back
 Of a Cadillac
 Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
 Yes, I'm in a band
 With a gang
 They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
 'Cause I'm back on the track
 And I'm beatin' the flack
 Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
 Just look at me now
 I'm just makin' my play
 Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way
 
 Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
 Well, I'm back, Yes I'm back
 Well, I'm back, back
 Well I'm back in black
 Yes I'm back in black
 
 Hoo yeah
 Oh yeah
 Yes I am
 Ooh yeah, yeah Oh yeah
 Back in now
 Well I'm back, I'm back
 Back, I'm back
 Back, I'm back
 Back, I'm back
 Back, I'm back
 Back
 Back in black
 Yes I'm back in black
 
 Out of the sight
 
 Oh, Beyonce, Beyonce
 Oh, Shakira, Shakira 
 
 He said I'm worth it, his one desire
 I know things about that him you wouldn't want to read about
 He kissed me, his one and only,  beautiful liar
 Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about
 
 You'll never know
 Why are we the ones who suffer?
 I have to let go
 He won't be the one to cry
 
  Let's not kill the karma
  Let's not start a fight
  It's not worth the drama
 For a beautiful liar
  Can't we laugh about it?
  It's not worth our time
  We can live without him
 Just a beautiful liar
 
 I trusted him, but when I followed you
 I saw you together
 I didn't know about you then till I saw you with him again
 I walked in on your love scene
 Slow dancing
 You stole everything, how could you say I did you wrong?
 
 We'll never know
 When the pain and heartbreak's over
 Have to let go
 The innocence is gone
 
  Let's not kill the karma
  Let's not start a fight
  It's not worth the drama
 For a beautiful liar
  Can't we laugh about it?
  It's not worth our time
  We can live without him
 Just a beautiful liar
 
 Tell me how to forgive you 
 When it's me who's ashamed 
 And I wish I could free you
 Of the hurt and the pain
 But the answer is simple
 He's the one to blame 
 
 Ay, Beyonce, Beyonce
 Ay, Shakira, Shakira
 Oh, Beyonce, Beyonce
 Oh, Shakira, Shakira
 
  Let's not kill the karma
  Let's not start a fight
  It's not worth the drama
 For a beautiful liar
  Can't we laugh about it?
  It's not worth our time
  We can live without him
 Just a beautiful liar
 
 En la terra humida escric, saps que 
 estic boig per tu
 em passo els dies esperant la nit.
 Com et puc estimar si de mi est's tan lluny; 
 servil i acabat boig per tu. 
 
 S' molt b' que des d'aquest bar
 Jo no puc arribar on ets tu,
 per' dins la meva copa veig
 reflexada la teva llum, me la beur'
 servil i acabat, boig per tu. 
 
 Quan no hi siguis al mat', 
 les ll'grimes es perdran 
 entre la pluja que caur' avui. 
 Em quedar' atrapat ebri d'aquesta llum 
 servil i acabat boig per tu. 
 
 S' molt b' que des d'aquest bar 
 Jo no puc arribar on ets tu, 
 per' dins la meva copa veig 
 reflexada la teva llum, me la beur'; 
 servil i acabat boig per tu. 
 
 S' molt b' que des d'aquest bar 
 Jo no puc arribar on ets tu, 
 per' dins la meva copa veig 
 reflexada la teva llum, me la beur'; 
 servil i acabat boig per tu. 
 servil i acabat boig per tu.
 
 I'm older but you're wiser than anyone can see
 Your patient like no other has even been with me
 Your eyes take me to places
 I'd never dreamt about
 Your voice is the only music I can't do without
 
 There can't be any doubts now
 We're just too far ahead to look behind
 And above the good and bad
 
 I need you to believe in my word
 I feel like a broken record
 And I've told you 700 times
 I don't need to keep looking
 My search is done
 
 Can you put your trust in my word
 I sound like a broken record
 And I've said it 700 times
 I don't need to keep looking
 You are the one
 
 Your hands that have no mercy
 Are also my best friends
 And I can get lost climbing on your legs that never end
 I found a perfect distance between my body on you
 And that is no distance, dear if that's alright with you
 They said we wouldn't make it
 But look at how we've beating all the odds
 I just need you to be aware of that
 
 I need you to believe in my word
 I feel like a broken record
 And I've told you 700 times
 I don't need to keep looking
 My search is done
 
 Can you put your trust in my word
 I sound like a broken record
 And I've told you 700 times
 I don't need to keep looking
 You are the one
 
 I just want you to take a leap of faith
 No it's easy to make all the same mistakes
 But I won't this time, no, not this time
 
 I need you to believe in my word
 I sound like a broken record
 And I've said it 700 times
 I don't need to keep looking
 You are the one
 
 A dozen icy summers were leading me to you
 I had to hear the liars to recognize the truth
 Remember the first Christmas
 It almost seemed untrue
 You promised that you'd always be with me
 And I promised too
 
 Por si este maleficio habla del peligro
 Mira las llamas rojas del amor en las sombras
 Nooo
 Ese es el sonido m's dulce que conocen mis oidos qu' hechizo
 Me lleva hasta tu nombre s'
 Si no
 Sacude el interior tus ojos de carbon
 Cu'l sera el exorcismo d'melo
 ahhhh
 
 Qu' clase de brujer'a domina mi coraz'n
 Un Halloween de mentiras, mentiras
 No sigas no
 Qu' clase de brujer'a encendida en mi raz'n
 Pero me matas de amor sin salida y que har'a yo
 
 Es como un aquelarre por los que se esconde
 entre mis fantas'as en la piel que se anima no
 No-s'
 Conoc' a una gitana de unas de gato
 Las plumas de lechuza y el arbol de un cilantro, s'
 S'-no
 Me dice mi emocion que no me niegue hoy
 trepan de tu escoba y ya se convirt'o
 
 Qu' clase de brujer'a domina mi coraz'n
 Un Halloween de mentiras, mentiras
 No sigas no
 Qu' clase de brujer'a encendida en mi raz'n
 Pero me matas de amor sin salida y que har'a yo
 
 And I left a note on my bedpost
 Said not to repeat
 Yesterday's mistakes
 What I tend to do
 When it comes to you
 I see only the good
 Selective memory
 The way you make me feel, yeah
 You gotta hold on me, I never met someone so different
 
 Oh here we go
 You're a part of me now
 You're a part of me
 So where you go I follow, follow, follow
 
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 I can't remember to forget you
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 I keep forgetting I should let you go
 But when you look at me
 The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 I can't remember to forget you
 
 I can't remember to forget you
 
 I go back again
 Fall off the train
 Land in his bed, repeat yesterday's mistakes
 What I'm trying to say
 Is not to forget
 You see only the good
 Selective memory
 
 The way he makes me feel like
 The way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid
 Oh here we go
 He a part of me now
 He a part of me
 So where he goes I follow, follow, follow
 
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 I can't remember to forget you
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 I keep forgetting I should let you go
 But when you look at me
 The only memory
 Is us kissing in the moonlight 
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 I can't remember to forget you
 
 I rob and I kill to keep him with me I
 Do anything for that boy
 I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight I
 Do anything for that boy
 
 I rob and I kill to keep him with me I
 Do anything for that boy
 I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight I
 Do anything for that boy
 
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 I can't remember to forget you
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 I keep forgetting I should let you go
 But when you look at me
 The only memory
 Is us kissing in the moonlight 
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 I can't remember to forget you
 
 But when you look at me
 The only memory
 Is us kissing in the moonlight 
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 Oh-oh ooh oh
 I can't remember to forget you
 
 Hoy es un d'a de aquellos
 En que miro hacia el cielo
 Tratando de descifrar el que est's
 De vez en cuando lejos
 Y de vez en cuando cerca
 Unas veces subir
 Y otras caer y yo
 Cuando t' te me acercas
 No respondo de mis actos
 Siento que aqu' voy
 De odiarte a quererte
 De principio a fin
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Hay cosas en la vida
 En que no encuentras salida
 Y ante tus ojos se cierra el tel'n
 Y tapas la boquilla del volc'n
 Que se hace lava que hace
 Mil a'os est' aqu' dentro y yo
 Tejiendo redecillas para ver si
 Puedo atraparte y aqu' voy
 Colando la macilla en medio de
 Este tr'pico mortal
 
 Y aqu' voy tejiendo redecillas
 Para ver si puedo atraparte
 Y aqu' estoy
 Colando la macilla en medio de
 Este tr'pico mortal
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor

 Ese movimiento sexy siempre me entretiene 
 Sabes manipularme bien con tus caderas 
 No s' porqu' me tienes en lista de espera 
 
 Te dicen por ah' que voy haciendo y deshaciendo 
 Que salgo cada noche, que te tengo ah' sufriendo 
 Que en esta relaci'n soy yo la que mando 
 No pares bola a toda esa mala propaganda 
 Pa-pa'qu' te digo na', te comen el o'do

 Y como un loco sigo tr's de t' 
 Muriendo por ti

 Sunrise blinded by the morning light
 Already dreaming up tonight
 And I know
 That it won't be long
 Oh, we can't hide
 From the love that burns this strong
 
 But it's just you and me
 And we chase our shadows
 We're waiting for, just waiting for
 The sun to go down
 But until it does
 We'll chase our shadows
 And when the night comes
 We will run from nothing, my love
 
 But it's just you and me
 And we chase our shadows
 We're waiting for, just waiting for
 The sun to go down
 But until it does
 We'll chase our shadows
 And when the night comes
 We will run from nothing, my love
 Nothing, my love
 Nothing, my love
 Nothing, my love
 Nothing, my love
 Nothing, my love
 Nothing, my love
 Nothing, my love
 Nothing, my love
 
 Night time
 And I am back in your arms
 When all my dreams are brought to life
 And I know that it won't be long
 For we can't hide
 From the love that burns this strong
 
 But it's just you and me
 And we chase our shadows
 We're waiting for, just waiting for
 The sun to go down
 But until it does
 We'll chase our shadows
 And when the night comes
 We will run from nothing, my love
 
 But it's just you and me
 And we chase our shadows
 We're waiting for, just waiting for
 The sun to go down
 But until it does
 We'll chase our shadows
 And when the night comes
 We will run from nothing, my love
 
 But it's just you and me
 And we chase our shadows
 We're waiting for, just waiting for
 The sun to go down
 But until it does
 We'll chase our shadows
 And when the night comes
 We will run from nothing, my love
 Nothing, my love
 
 Se me acaba el argumento
 Y la metodolog'a
 Cada vez que se aparece frente
 A m' tu anatom'a
 
 Por que este amor ya no entiende
 De consejos, ni razones
 Se alimenta de pretextos
 Y le faltan pantalones
 Este amor no me permite
 Estar en pie
 Por que ya hasta me ha quebrado
 Los talones
 Aunque me levante volver' a caer
 Si te acercas nada es 'til
 Para esta in'til
 
 Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
 Torpe, traste y testaruda
 Es todo lo que he sido
 Por ti me he convertido
 En una cosa que no hace
 Otra cosa mas que amarte
 Pienso en ti d'a y noche
 Y no se como olvidarte
 Cu'ntas veces he intentado
 Enterrarte en mi memoria
 Y aunque diga ya no m's
 Es otra vez la misma historia
 Por que este amor siempre sabe
 Hacerme respirar profundo
 Ya me trae por la izquierda
 Y de pelea con el mundo
 
 Si pudiera exorcizarme de tu voz
 Si pudiera escaparme de tu nombre
 Si pudiera arrancarme el coraz'n
 Y esconderme para no sentirme
 Nuevamente
 
 Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
 Torpe, traste y testaruda
 Es todo lo que he sido
 Por ti me he convertido
 En una cosa que no hace
 Otra cosa mas que amarte
 Pienso en ti d'a y noche
 Y no se como olvidarte
 
 Ojerosa, flaca, fea desgre'ada
 Torpe, tonta, lenta, n'cia, desquiciada
 Completamente descontrolada
 Tu te das cuenta y no me dices nada
 Se me ha vuelto
 La cabeza un nido
 Donde solamente tu tienes asilo
 Y no me escuchas lo que te digo
 Mira bien lo que vas a hacer conmigo
 
 Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
 Torpe, traste y testaruda
 Es todo lo que he sido
 Por ti me he convertido
 En una cosa que no hace
 Otra cosa mas que amarte
 Pienso en ti d'a y noche
 Y no se como olvidarte
 
 Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
 Torpe, traste y testaruda
 Es todo lo que he sido
 Por ti me he convertido
 En una cosa que no hace
 Otra cosa mas que amarte
 Pienso en ti d'a y noche
 Y no se como olvidarte
 
 Bruta, ciega, sordomuda
 Torpe, traste y testaruda
 Es todo lo que he sido
 Por ti me he convertido
 En una cosa que no hace
 Otra cosa mas que amarte
 Pienso en ti d'a y noche
 Y no se como olvidarte
 
 We hit on a plane
 Flying across the sky
 Searching for islands were we could land
 Too far away to be found
 We took off our gloves and danced like if we've gone mad
 Took a dip in the ocean
 To wash away all the sand
 
 I'm not alone
 Not anymore this time
 I found my love
 Under a coconut tree
 
 Where we created a universe
 Hiding from all of that
 Where nothing mattered but you and me
 Make it like it used to be
 Give me a time machine
 With you and I riding on a tree
 Only you and me
 Under a coconut tree
 Uuh
 Uuh
 Uuh
 
 It's like we designed the anatomy of a dream
 As crazy in love as we'll ever be
 Inside a fantasy
 Under the stars
 Floating above the sea
 And we were lost like
 We always dreamt to be
 
 I'm not alone
 I say to myself
 I found my home
 Under a coconut tree
 
 Where we created a universe
 Hiding from all of that
 Where nothing mattered but you and me
 Make it like it used to be
 Give me a time machine
 With you and I riding on a dream
 Only you and me
 Under a coconut tree
 Uuh
 Uuh
 Uuh
 
 Uuh
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
 Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
 
 We hit on a plane
 Flying across the sky
 Searching for islands where we could land
 
 I'm leaving with a broken heart
 Never meant to do you harm
 Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
 And everybody hurts sometimes
 Never meant to do you harm
 I know you're gonna be just fine, he said
 
 J'ai pri' pour nous, tard le soir
 Tu m'as tourn' le dos plus d'une fois
 Personne ne t'aimera comme moi
 Personne ne t'aimera comme moi
 Maintenant faut me laisser m'en aller
 Faut me laisser, t'es condamn'e
 Tu m'as d'laiss' depuis tant d'ann'es
 Mais saches que personne ne t'aimera comme moi
 Maintenant faut me laisser m'en aller
 Faut me laisser, t'es condamn'e
 Tu m'as d'laiss' depuis tant d'ann'es
 Mais saches que personne ne t'aimera comme moi
 
 I'm leaving with a broken heart
 I never meant to do you harm
 Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
 But everybody hurts sometimes
 Never meant to do you wrong
 I know you're gonna be just fine, he said
 
 J'avais des probl'mes, tu t'en foutais
 Des probl'mes de riches, on m'a vu manger seul au Fouquet's
 Pour toi j'aurai tout fait, je me serai laisser 'touff'
 Fa'on de parler, mais tous les hommes sont pas pareils
 Rends-moi l'appareil ou alors on arr'te
 Je m''tais jur' que tu serais la seule dans mon harem
 Oui, tu ressembles ' ma reum
 C'est pour 'a, j'suis piqu'
 Mais dis-moi de quoi t'as reu-p', on est juste en train de s'expliquer
 
 I'm leaving with a broken heart
 I never meant to do you harm
 Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
 But everybody hurts sometimes
 Never meant to do you wrong
 I know you're gonna be just fine, he said
 
 I wish I could go back in time
 See the world with different eyes
 Knowing what we both know now
 We could've made it work somehow
 We said, what we said
 And what we made, we can't unmake
 And what we gave, is what we get
 And this is what we're stuck with now
 
 Maintenant faut me laisser m'en aller
 Faut me laisser, t'es condamn'e
 Tu m'as d'laiss' depuis tant d'ann'es
 Mais saches que personne ne t'aimera comme moi
 
 Do you remember, how you used to get lost in my eyes?
 Do you remember, how you promised you'd never say goodbye
 I remember, I remember, I remember
 
 Faut me laisser m'en aller
 Faut me laisser, t'es condamn'e
 Tu m'as d'laiss' depuis tant d'ann'es
 Mais saches que personne ne t'aimera comme moi
 But we said, whatever that we said
 And what we made, we know we can't unmake
 And what we get, is only what we gave
 Mais saches que personne ne t'aimera comme moi
 
 Cuando pienso que este asunto
 se puede solucionar
 te me acercas y echas todo marcha atras
 y el temor me hizo en eso mucho mas fuerte que tu
 pero me vas a vencer asi nomas
 pero ahora me doy cuenta
 que mi pulso se acelera y tiemblo
 se me atrofian mis sentidos
 se detienen mis latidos
 no soporto que tu controles mi destino.
 Ten un poco de compasion por mi
 no ves que estoy a punto de desistir
 me encuentro inmovil de cabeza a los pies
 y ya sinceramente no se que hacer.
 Ten un poco de compasi'n por mi
 no ves que estoy a punto de desistir
 me encuentro inmovil de cabeza a los pies
 y ya sinceramente no se que hacer.
 Y ahora me dice por dentro
 que me olvide ya del miedo
 que el amor en mi esta ardiendo como el fuego
 y el temor de que me queme
 vuelve e invade mi terreno
 que las cosas no funcionen como quiero
 pero ese sentimiento es mas fuerte
 que mis pensamientos
 se me atrofian mis sentidos
 se detienen mis latidos
 no soporto que tu controles mi destino.
 Ten un poco de compasion por mi.
 
 Told you I felt lucky with my humble breasts
 Well, I don't
 Said that I was sure the world was gonna change
 Well, I'm not
 Before I didn't give a damn 'bout what they say
 But I do
 Promised that I'll never-ever lie to you
 
 So you can't hide
 Taking the make-up off my face
 Before I forget my own features
 
 I'm not here to let you down
 But the costume makes the clown
 It's just lashing out on me, don't be so hard
 Don't be so hard on this
 It's your turn now
 To cheat on me
 
 Promises I made to you went down the sink
 Really hope I haven't harmed your self-esteem
 I'm not a virgin but I'm not the whore you think
 And I don't always smell like strawberries and cream
 
 So you can hide
 I'm taking the make-up off my face
 Before I forget who I am now
 
 'Cause I'm not here to let you down
 But the costume makes the clown
 It's just life's anatomy, don't be so hard
 Don't be so hard on this
 It's your turn now, turn now
 
 I'm not here to let you down
 But the costume makes the clown
 It's just life's anatomy, don't be so hard
 Don't be so hard on this
 It's your turn now, your turn now
 
 So don't shit on me
 
 Aunque tus dias sean largos,
 y te cubra un cielo gris y triste
 cuentas conmigo
 Aunque tus noches sean invierno,
 y en tu desvelo te espere un mal dia
 cuentas conmigo
 Cuando en tu rostro reflejes nostalgia
 y una sonrisa mal dibujada
 cuentas conmigo
 Y en tus ojos las lagrimas corran
 y tus manos se tornen frias
 piensa que estoy yo contigo y cuentas conmigo
 
 Cuentas conmigo amor,
 porque tu eres mi vida entera
 Cuentas conmigo amor,
 porque no tenemos barreras
 Cuentas conmigo amor,
 porque en las noches tu eres mi estrella
 Cuentas conmigo amor, cuentas conmigo
 
 Aunque tus dias sean largos,
 y te cubra un cielo gris y triste
 cuentas conmigo
 Y en tus ojos las lagrimas corran
 y tus manos se tornen frias
 piensa que estoy yo contigo y cuentas conmigo
 Cuentas conmigo amor,
 porque tu eres mi vida entera
 
 Cuentas conmigo amor,
 porque no tenemos barreras
 Cuentas conmigo amor,
 porque en las noches tu eres mi estrella
 Cuentas conmigo amor
 
 Cuando todo en ti sea alegria y felicidad
 cuentas conmigo
 Tendre la certeza de saber
 que cuento contigo
 
 Cuentas conmigo amor,
 porque tu eres mi vida entera
 Cuentas conmigo amor,
 porque no tenemos barreras
 Cuentas conmigo amor,
 porque en las noches tu eres mi estrella
 Cuentas conmigo amor y cuento contigo
 
 Why do you say things if you do not mean them?
 Why do you fill up my wounds with your dirt?
 Bullets of fire, this time I can't shield them
 Santa Maria, I know how it hurts
 
 'Cause you cut me deep
 Your words are like steel
 And now I can't sleep
 'Cause I'll never heal
 
 Why do you make me believe we are spirits?
 Mourning together to conquer this earth 
 Climb up the mountains, so high we can see them
 Then send me to plummet with savaging words
 
 'Cause you cut me deep
 Your words are like steel
 And now I can't sleep
 'Cause I'll never heal
 
 I am covered in scars
 Like a rose without thorns
 My defenses are gone
 No one's out there to warn
 If there's love in your heart
 Let me leave now in peace
 You know you took it too far
 
 'Cause you cut me deep
 Your words are like steel
 And now I can't sleep
 'Cause I'll never heal
 
 You cut me deep, you cut me so deep
 You cut me deep, you cut me so deep
 You cut me deep, you cut me so deep
 You cut me deep, you cut me so, so, so, so
 
 You cut me deep, you cut me so deep yeah
 You cut me deep you cut me so
 
 La la la la la
 
 I dare you!
 
 All of my life, too late
 To you showed out with perfect timing
 Now, here we are, you rock it
 Our fingers are stuck in the socket
 It's just a mature, a game
 Get ready, we'll do it again
 Let's not recover from the hangover
 When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
 Is it true that you love me?
 I dare you to kiss me
 With everyone watching
 It's truth or dare on the dance floor
 
 La la la la la
 Truth or dare on the dance floor
 La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
 I dare you
 
 Of all the millions, on the planet
 You're the one is keeping me on it
 You know I like you, and nobody's business
 And your are my witness
 It's just a mature, a game
 Get ready, we'll do it again
 Let's not recover from the hangover
 When your eyes got me drunk I was sober
 Is it true that you love me?
 I dare you to kiss me
 With everyone watching
 It's truth or dare on the dance floor
 
 La la la la la
 Truth or dare on the dance floor
 La la la la la oh, oh, oh, oh
 I dare you
 
 Is it true that you love me?
 I dare you to kiss me
 I dare you to touch me
 It's truth or dare on the dance floor
 
 La la la la la
 I dare you
 
 Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
 Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
 
 T' me abriste las heridas que ya daba por curadas 
 Con lim'n, tequila y sal 
 Una historia repetida
 Solamente un d'j' vu que nunca llega a su final
 
 Mejor me quedo solo 
 Y me olvido de tus cosas, de tus ojos 
 Mejor esquivo el polvo
 No quiero caer de nuevo en esa foto 
 De locura, hipocres'a total
 
 'Qui'n puede hablar del amor y defenderlo? 
 Que levante la mano por favor
 'Qui'n puede hablar del dolor y pagar la fianza? 
 Pa' que salga de mi coraz'n
 Si alguien va a hablar del amor
 Te lo aseguro, esa no voy a ser yo
 No, esa no voy a ser yo
 
  
  
 
 Esta idea recurrente 
 Quiere jugar con mi mente pa' volverme a engatusar 
 Una historia repetida
 Solamente un d'j' vu que nunca llega a su final
 
 Mejor me quedo sola 
 Y me olvido de tus cosas, de tus ojos 
 Mejor esquivo el polvo
 No quiero caer de nuevo en esa foto 
 De locura, de hipocres'a total
 
 'Qui'n puede hablar del amor y defenderlo? 
 Levante la mano por favor
 'Qui'n puede hablar del dolor y pagar la fianza? 
 Pa' que salga de mi coraz'n

 Te lo aseguro, esa no voy a ser yo

 Esa no voy a ser yo
 
 No hay mas vida, no hay
 No hay mas vida, no hay
 No hay mas lluvia, no hay
 No hay mas brisa, no hay
 No hay mas risa, no hay
 No hay mas llanto, no hay
 No hay mas miedo, no hay
 No hay mas canto, no hay...
 Llevame donde estes, llevame
 Llevame, llevame donde estes
 Llevame
 Cuando alguien se va, el que se queda sufre mas
 Cuando alguien se va, el que se queda sufre mas...
 No hay mas cielo, no hay
 No hay mas viento, no hay
 No hay mas hielo, no hay
 No hay mas fuego, no hay
 No hay mas vida, no hay
 No hay mas vida, no hay
 No hay mas rabia, no hay
 No hay mas sue'o, no hay...
 Llevame donde estes, llevame
 Llevame donde estes
 Llevame
 Cuando alguien se va, el que se queda sufre mas
 Cuando alguien se va, el que se queda sufre mas...
 Sufre mas ...
 Sufre mas...
 
 No pens' que me fuera a importar
 El tono de tu mensaje
 Me dejaste la sensaci'n de haber sido un peso m's
 En tu equipaje
 
 Todav'a me aferro a tu amor
 Como un hierro caliente
 Me hice tan resistente al dolor
 Y a la decepci'n 'ltimamente
 
 Creo creo
 No en lo que me cuentan sino solo en lo que veo
 Y por lo que veo creo
 Que ya te has olvidado de m'
 Siento que te pierdo no hay se'al
 Al' al', 'hay alguien ah'?
 Tanta indiferencia me hace mal
 Al' al', sigo aqu'
 No respondo a otro tim'n
 Que a esta rara devoci'n por ti
 
 El derrumbe de la soledad
 Te ara' en el costado
 No hubo un sitio mejor para estar
 Luego del amor que a tu lado
 
 Creo creo
 No en lo que me cuentan sino solo en lo que veo
 Y por lo que veo creo
 Que ya te has olvidado de m'
 Siento que te pierdo no hay se'al
 Al' al', 'hay alguien ah'?
 Tanta indiferencia me hace mal
 Al' al', sigo aqu'
 No respondo a otro tim'n
 Que a esta rara devoci'n por ti
 
 No hay salida de incendio
 Me quemo por dentro
 No hay distancia entre los dos
 
 Siento que te pierdo no hay se'al
 Al' al', 'hay alguien ah'?
 Tanta indiferencia me hace mal
 Al' al', sigo aqu'
 No respondo a otro tim'n
 Que a esta rara devoci'n por ti 
 
 Te conoc' un d'a de enero
 Con la luna en mi nariz
 Y como vi que eras sincero
 En tus ojos me perd'
 
 Que torpe distracci'n
 Y que dulce sensaci'n
 
 Y ahora que andamos por el mundo
 Como eneas y benitin
 Ya te encontr' varios rasgu'os
 Que te hicieron por ah'
 
 Pero mi loco amor
 Es tu mejor doctor
 
 Voy a curarte el alma en duelo
 Voy a dejarte como nuevo
 Y todo va a pasar
 Pronto ver's el sol brillar
 
 T' m's que nadie merece ser feliz
 
 Ya vas a ver como van sanando
 Poco a poco tus heridas
 Ya vas a ver como va
 La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar
 
 Y aunque hayas sido un extranjero
 Hasta en tu propio pa's
 Si yo te digo 'qu' dices tu?
 Tu a'n dices 'que dec's?
 Y lloras de emoci'n oyendo un bandone'n
 
 Y aunque parezcas despistado con ese caminar pausado
 Conozco la raz'n que hace doler tu coraz'n
 Por eso quise hacerte esta canci'n
 
 Ya vas a ver como van sanando
 Poco a poco tus heridas
 Ya vas a ver como va
 La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar
 
 Ya vas a ver como van sanando
 Poco a poco tus heridas
 Ya vas a ver como va
 La misma vida a decantar la sal que sobra del mar
 
 I met you on a January day
 With the moon on my nose
 And how I saw you were sincere
 In your eyes I was lost
 
 What a clumsy distraction
 What a sweet sensation
 
 And now that we walk through the world
 Like Eneas and Benitin
 I found you various scratches
 That made you out there
 
 But my crazy love
 Is your best doctor
 
 I am going to cure your hurting soul
 I am going to make you like new
 And all is going to pass
 Soon you will see the sunshine
 
 You more than anyone deserve to be happy
 
 You are going to see as they heal
 Little by little your wounds
 You are going to see them go
 The same life as emptying the salt that is left in the sea
 
 And although you were a foreigner
 Even in your own country
 If I say to you "How do you say?"
 You just still say "What did you say?"
 And you cry with emotion listening to a bandeneon
 
 And although you look confused with the leisurely walk
 I know the reason that makes your heart hurt
 For that I wanted to make you this song
 
 You are going to see as they heal
 Little by little your wounds
 You are going to see them go
 The same life as emptying the salt that is left in the sea
 
 You are going to see as they heal
 Little by little your wounds
 You are going to see them go
 The same life as emptying the salt that is left in the sea
 
 Ya no s' si es muy tarde para ti
 Quiero desafiar la comodidad
 No nos sirve m's fingir
 
 Yo no s' cuan ef'mero es tu error
 Ya te perdon'
 Adelant' las agujas del reloj
 
 La l'grima sec'
 Se aleja el temporal
 Latiendo como el sol
 Mi coraz'n no tiene edad
 Para esperarte
 
 Este es un d'a especial
 Quiero creer en otra oportunidad
 Dimos un salto mortal
 Y hoy vuelvo a ver
 Un faro en la oscuridad
 
 Ya no estoy tan confusa como ayer
 Solo la ilusi'n trae desilusi'n
 Y es tan f'cil de caer
 
 El mundo en que cre'
 Lo eterno y lo fugaz
 Prefiero darle fin
 Aunque me ocultes la verdad m's vulnerable
 
 Este es un d'a especial
 Quiero creer en otra oportunidad
 Dimos un salto mortal
 Y hoy vuelvo a ver
 Un faro en la oscuridad
 
 Latiendo como el sol
 Mi coraz'n no tiene edad
 
 Este es un d'a especial
 Quiero creer en otra oportunidad
 Dimos un salto mortal
 Y hoy vuelvo a ver
 Un faro en la oscuridad
 
 Special Day
 
 I don't know if it's already too late for you
 I want to defy comfort
 It doesn't help us to pretend
 
 I don't know how ephemeral your mistake is
 I already forgave you
 I set forward the hands of the clock
 
 The tear dried up
 The storm passed
 Beating like the sun
 My heart will never grow tired
 Of waiting for you
 
 This is a special day
 I want to believe in another opportunity
 We tool a mortal leap
 And today I return to see
 A light in the darkness
 
 No longer am I as confused as yesterday
 Only illusion brings disillusion
 And it it so easy to fall
 
 The world in which I believed
 The eternal and the fleeting
 I prefer to give closure
 Although you hide the most vulnerable
 truth from me
 
 This is a special day
 I want to believe in another opportunity
 We took a mortal leap
 And today I return to see
 A light in the darkness
 
 Beating like the sun
 My heart will not grow tired
 
 This is a special day
 I want to believe in another opportunity
 We took a mortal leap
 And today I return to see
 A light in the darkness
 
 First floor 
 Room sixteen 
 Smells like danger 
 Even better 
 Set your goals 
 Bless our souls 
 I'm in trouble 
 But it feels like heaven 
 
 You were like one of those guys
 The kind with a wandering eye 
 But I said, hey what the hell?
 For once in my life I'll take a ride on the wild side
 
 You were so full of yourself
 But damn, were you cute, as well 
 You liked my legs, I liked your moves
 Anyone could tell that it's hard to deny that
 
 I did it again now
 I've got it all wrong
 But it felt so right
 I can't believe it
 No more mistakes that
 Went on for too long
 Wish there was a way
 I could delete 'em
 
 Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh
 Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh
 
 Second night 
 In a row 
 Back in trouble 
 I don't get it 
 
 Gotta keep it down 
 It'll all be cool 
 If we ignore 'em 
 Getting better 
 
 When it comes to men, it's known
 That I end up choosing wrong 
 'Cause I always trip and fall
 On the same old rock and repeat and go back
 
 How blind a girl can be 
 To miss you hide your ring 
 But I bought everything
 I'm so naive, and I'd like you to know that
 
 I did it again now
 I've got it all wrong
 But it felt so right
 I can't believe it
 No more mistakes that
 Went on for too long
 Wish there was a way
 I could delete 'em
 
 Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh
 Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh
 
 It might seem to you that I am in a place
 Where I'm losing the direction of my life
 But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
 Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive
 
 It might seem to you that I am in a place
 Where I'm losing the direction of my life
 But I'm sure that this is nothing but a phase
 Right back at ya, 'cause I'll survive
 
 I did it again now
 I've got it all wrong
 But it felt so right
 I can't believe it
 All the mistakes that
 Went on for too long
 Wish there was a way
 I could delete 'em
 
 I did it again now
 I've got it all wrong
 
 Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh
 Eh, eh, eh, eh, uh, uh, uh, uh
 
 She's got the kind of look that defies gravity
 She's the greatest cook
 And she's fat free
 
 She's been to private school
 And she speaks perfect French
 She's got the perfect friends
 Oh isn't she cool?
 
 She practices Tai Chi
 She'd never lose her nerve
 She's more than you deserve
 She's just far better than me
 
 Hey, hey
 
 So don't bother
 I won't die of deception
 I promise you won't ever see me cry
 Don't feel sorry
 
 And don't bother
 I'll be fine
 But she's waiting
 The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
 So don't bother, be unkind
 
 I'm sure she doesn't know
 How to touch you like I would
 I beat her at that one good
 Don't you think so?
 
 She's almost six feet tall
 She must think I'm a flea
 I'm really a cat, you see
 And it's not my last life at all
 
 Hey, hey
 
 So don't bother
 I won't die of deception
 I promise you won't ever see me cry
 Don't feel sorry
 
 Don't bother
 I'll be fine
 But she's waiting
 The ring you gave to her will lose its shine
 So don't bother, be unkind
 
 For you, I'd give up all I own
 And move to a communist country
 If you came with me, of course
 And I'd file my nails so they don't hurt you
 And lose those pounds, and learn about football
 If it made you stay, but you won't, but you won't
 
 So don't bother
 I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
 I promise you won't ever see me cry
 
 And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type
 I promise you won't ever see me cry
 
 Don't bother
 I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine
 I promise you won't ever see me cry
 
 And after all I'm glad that I'm not your type
 Not your type, not your type, not your type
 I promise you won't ever see me cry
 
 Los han visto por ah'
 Los han visto en los tejados
 Dando vueltas en Paris
 Condenando en los juzgados
 
 Con la nariz empolvada
 De corbata o de blue jeans
 Los han visto en las portadas todas
 Sin mas nada que decir
 
 Donde est'n los ladrones
 Donde esta el asesino
 Quiz' all' revolc'ndose
 En el patio del vecino
 Y que pasa si son ellos
 Y que pasa si soy yo
 El que toca esta guitarra
 O la que canta esta canci'n
 La que canta esta canci'n
 
 Los han visto de rodillas
 Sentados o de cuclillas
 Parados dando lecciones
 En todas las posiciones
 Predicando en las iglesias
 Hasta ofreciendo conciertos
 Los han visto en los c'cteles todos
 Repartiendo ministerios
 
 Donde est'n los ladrones
 Donde esta el asesino
 Quiz' all' revolc'ndose
 En el patio del vecino
 Y que pasa si son ellos
 Y que pasa si soy yo
 El que toca esta guitarra
 O la que canta esta canci'n
 La que canta esta canci'n
 
 'D'nde est's coraz'n?
 Ayer te busqu'
 Entre el suelo, y el cielo, mi cielo
 Y no te encontr'
 Y puedo pensar que huyes de mi
 Porque mi silencio una corazonada
 Me dice que s'
 
 'D'nde est's coraz'n?
 Ven regresa por mi
 Que la vida se me vuelve en ocho
 Si no estas aqu'
 Y quiero pensar
 Que no tardar's
 Porque en el planeta no existe
 M's nadie a quien pueda yo amar
 
 ('D'nde est's coraz'n?
 Ayer te busqu'
 'D'nde est's coraz'n?
 Y no te encontr')
 
 'D'nde est's coraz'n?
 Saliste de aqu'
 Ay buscando quien sabe
 Que cosas
 Tan lejos de mi
 Y puedo pensar
 Y vuelvo a pensar
 Que no tardar's
 Porque en el planeta
 No existe m's nadie
 A quien pueda yo amar
 
 ('D'nde est's coraz'n?
 Ayer te busqu'
 'D'nde est's coraz'n?
 Y no te encontr')
 
 Te busqu'
 En el armario
 En el abecedario
 Debajo del carro
 En el negro en el blanco
 En los libros de historia
 En las revistas
 En la radio
 
 Te busqu' por las calles
 En donde tu madre
 En cuadros de botero
 En mi monedero
 En dos mil religiones
 Te busque hasta
 En mis canciones

 Once upon a time you and I
 When we were dreaming easy
 Fresh as limes and happy as a Sunday sky
 There was nothing we could sell or buy
 'Cause all we really needed
 Was our bare feet and a pair of wings to fly
 
 What do you think, darling?
 Have we lived too much, too fast?
 And have you
 Have you felt melancholy, darling
 Wishing that time hadn't passed?
 
 Can you tell me how it used to be?
 Have we missed our chance?
 Have we changed our hopes for fears and our dreams for plans?
 
 Can you tell me how it used to be
 When we really cared?
 And when love was on our side
 On our side
 
 I remember all the times before
 When we could spend our evening
 Staring at the ceiling, lying on the floor
 My vocabulary wasn't broad
 I spoke so little English
 And the word "stress" would sound like something odd
 
 What do you think, darling?
 Have I lived too much, too fast?
 And have you
 Have you felt the melancholy, darling
 Wishing that time hadn't passed?
 
 Can you tell me how it used to be?
 Have we missed our chance?
 Have we changed our hopes for fears and our dreams for plans?
 Can you tell me how it used to be
 When we really cared?
 And when love was on our side
 On our side
 
 What is your guess, darling?
 Have I lived too much, too fast?
 So if you
 If you ever come and find me crying
 Now you know, now you know why
 
 Can you tell me how I used to be?
 Have I missed my chance?
 Have I changed my hopes for fears and my dreams for plans?
 Can you tell me how it used to be
 When we really cared?
 And when love was on our side
 
 On our side
 
 Lo m'o es un homenaje a la reconciliaci'n al amor
 Entre la gente que es la bendici'n de Dios
 Lo m'o es andar sembrando la semilla del perd'n
 Y recoger de coshecha la vida es una ilusi'n
 Y entre mis hermanos una y otra vez cambiarles
 Por flores
 Tal vez sesatez y entre tanto odio que caiga a sus pies
 Una avemar'a llenito de f'
 
 Chorus:
 
 Para qu' el orgullo si nos hiere tanto
 Rompe corazones y nos va alejado
 Para que rencores si hay solo una vida
 Y llegando al cielo
 El rencor se olvida un oasis de placer
 En este mundo quiero ver
 Un oasis de verdad
 Donde yo te pueda amar
 
 Lo m'o es darnos la mano
 Y hallar en el coraz'n
 Un oasis de ternura donde crezca
 Nuestro amor ay
 Lo m'o es ir a tu lado y de tu aliento
 Vivir aunque digan que es capricho
 Los que siento yo por ti.
 
 Chorus
 
 Take off all of your skin
 And brave when you are free
 Shake off all of your sins
 And give them to me
 Close up, let me back yea
 I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
 And my heart beats
 
 Like the empires of the world unite
 We are alive
 And the stars make love to the universe
 You're my wildfire every single night
 We are alive
 And the stars make love to the universe
 And you touch me
 And I'm like and I'm like and I'm like
 Wooo wooo
 And I'm like woo woo
 And I'm like woo woo
 And I'm like woo
 
 I will follow you down wherever you go
 I, I'm, baby, I'm bound to you and do you know?
 Closer, pull me in tight
 I wanna be yours, wanna be your hero
 And my heart beats
 
 Like the empires of the world unite
 We are alive
 And the stars make love to the universe
 You're my wildfire every single night
 We are alive
 And the stars make love to the universe
 And you touch me
 And I'm like and I'm like and I'm like
 Woo woo
 We are alive
 Woo woo
 And I'm like woo woo
 We are alive
 Woo
 
 I'm just gonna raise my head
 Welcome to the final edge
 And I'm gonna fall
 I'm just gonna raise my head
 And hold you close
 
 Like the empires of the world unite
 We are alive
 And the stars make love to the universe
 You're my wildfire every single night
 We are alive
 And the stars make love to the universe
 And you touch me
 And I'm like and I'm like and I'm like
 Woo woo
 And I'm like woo woo
 And I'm like woo woo
 And I'm like woo
 
 Quand tu, quand tu me prend dans tes bas
 Quand je regarde dans tes yeux
 Je vois que Dieu existe
 C'est pas dur croire
 
 Antes de conocerte el mundo era plano
 Aunque lo discuta usted Se'or Galilei
 Y me cans' de besar ranas en vano
 Pero el pr'ncipe azul
 Jam's no encontr'
 
 Y as' llegaste t'
 Devolvi'ndome la fe
 Sin poemas y sin flores
 Con defectos con errores
 Pero en pie
 
 Y siento
 Algo en ti algo entre los dos
 Que me hace insistir
 Cuando miro en tus pupilas s' que Dios no dej' de existir
 Y siento
 Algo en ti algo entre los dos
 Que me hace insistir
 Cuando miro en tus pupilas s' que Dios no dej' de existir
 T' lo haces vivir
 T' lo haces vivir
 
 La vida es una colecci'n de recuerdos
 Pero a nada como tu recuerdo tan bien
 Desde la redondez que tienen tus labios
 Al olor de tu pelo
 Al color de tu piel
 
 No pienses que te ir's y me voy a resignar
 Eres lo mejor que me ha pasado
 Entre lo mundano y lo sagrado
 Y a'n m's
 
 Y siento
 Algo en ti algo entre los dos
 Que me hace insistir
 Cuando miro en tus pupilas s' que Dios no dej' de existir
 Y siento
 Algo en ti algo entre los dos
 Que me hace insistir
 Cuando miro en tus pupilas s' que Dios no dej' de existir
 T' lo haces vivir
 T' lo haces vivir
 
 Quand tu, quand tu me prend dans tes bas
 Quand je regarde dans tes yeux
 Je vois que Dieu existe
 C'est pas dur croire
 
 Y siento
 Algo en ti
 Y siento
 Que algo en mi
 Y siento algo en mi
 Algo
 Algo en mi
 
 In Your Pupils
 
 When you take me in your arms
 When I look into your eyes
 I know God sill exists
 You make me believe
 
 Before I met you the world was flat
 Though you, Mr. Galileo, might argue that
 And I got tired of kissing frogs
 Prince Charming
 Never showed up
 And then you arrived
 Restoring my faith
 Without poems or flowers
 With defects and faults
 But standing straight
 
 And there's something
 Something in you, something between the two of us
 That makes me persist
 When I look in the pupils of your eyes I
 know that God still exists
 And there's something
 Something in you, something between the two of us
 That makes me persist
 When I look in the pupils of your eyes I
 know that God still exists
 You make him live
 You make him live
 
 Life is a collection of memories
 But I don't remember anything as
 well as I remember you
 From the fullness of your lips
 To the color of your hair
 To the smell of your skin
 
 Don't think you'll go and I'll just accept it
 You're the best thing that has ever happened to me
 Among the sacred and mundane
 And even more than that
 
 And there's something
 Something in you, something between the two of us
 That makes me persist
 When I look in the pupils of your eyes 
 I know that God still exists
 And there's something
 Something in you, something between the two of us
 That makes me persist
 When I look in the pupils of your eyes
 I know that God still exists
 You make him live
 You make him live
 
 When you take me in your arms
 When I look into your eyes
 I know God still exists
 You make me believe
 
 Eres sensacional
 un loco de ideas raras
 muy original
 eres sentimental
 tambien transparente
 pero tan diferente
 a todo el que conozco
 igual yo reconozco
 cuando estoy sin ti
 no me siento viva
 no me siento plena
 solo tu me llenas
 que eres mi prisi'n
 y dulce condena.
 
 Que es lo que te hace
 ser tan especial
 paralizas mi alma
 solo con hablar
 Que tienen tus ojos
 que hacen derretirme
 y me encantas tu
 tu estilo de amar
 Que es lo que te hace ser
 tan sonador
 dices lo que piensas
 sin ningun temor
 eres brisa y calma
 eres fuego y emoci'n
 vi su oscuridad
 y oi calor.
 Tu agresividad
 y mi alma salvaje
 que busca intimidarme
 poeta empedernido
 bohemio confundido
 ha sido para mi
 mi espacio y mi tiempo
 mi mejor invento
 porque tu me ensenaste
 la dulce emocion
 de enamorarme.
 Que es lo que te hace
 ser tan especial...
 
 Bienvenido has llegado 
 En el momento justo 
 Y al lugar indicado 
 No todo lo rico engorda 
 Y no todo lo bueno es pecado 
 
 Yo ser' tus deseos hechos piernas 
 Una idea recurrente de fascinaci'n 
 Yo ser' un complot para tu mente 
 El objeto y la causa de tu perdici'n 
 Y tu buena suerte 
 
 Cuenta del uno al diez 
 Y me escondo donde puedas verme 
 Es mi forma de jugar al escondite ingl's 
 B'same de una vez 
 Y te amarro a mi sof' burgu's 
 Es mi forma de jugar al escondite 
 Es mi forma de jugar al escondite 
 Es mi forma de jugar al escondite ingl's 
 
 No me juzgues no soy de esas 
 Solo porque tengo una mente traviesa 
 No todo lo rico engorda 
 Y no el que peca empata si reza 
 
 Yo ser' tus deseos hechos piernas 
 La que dicte una sentencia a tu imaginaci'n 
 Yo ser' un complot para tu mente 
 El objeto de la causa de tu perdici'n 
 Y tu buena suerte 
 
 Cuenta del uno al diez 
 Y me escondo donde puedas verme 
 Es mi forma de jugar al escondite ingl's 
 B'same de una vez 
 Y te amarro a mi sof' burgu's 
 Es mi forma de jugar al escondite 
 Es mi forma de jugar al escondite 
 Es mi forma de jugar al escondite ingl's 
 
 Cuenta del uno al diez 
 Y me escondo donde puedas verme 
 Cuenta del uno al diez 
 Y me escondo donde puedas verme 
 Uno, dos, uno, dos, uno, dos, uno, dos, dos por cinco diez
 
 Hide and Seek
 
 Welcome, you have arrived
 At just the right moment
 And just the right time
 
 Not all tasty foods are fattening
 Not all good things are sin
 
 I will be your wishes 
 A recurring impulse of fascination
 I'll be a plot for your mind
 The object of and reason of your perdition
 And your good luck
 
 Count from one to ten
 I'll hide where you can see me
 That's my way of playing hide and seek
 Kiss me once
 I'll tie you to my sofa
 That's my way of playing hide and seek
 That's my way of playing hide and seek
 That's my way of playing hide and seek
 
 Don't judge me, I'm not one of those
 Just because I have a mischievious mind
 
 Not all tasty foods are fattening
 Nor does the one who sins break even if he prays
 
 I'll be your wishes 
 A recurring fascination
 I'll be a plot for your mind
 The object of and reason for your perdition
 And your good luck
 
 Count from one to ten
 I'll hide where you can see me
 That's my way of playing hide and seek
 Kiss me once
 I'll tie you to my sofa
 That's my way of playing hide and seek
 That's my way of playing hide and seek
 That's my way of playing hide and seek
 
 Na na na naaaaa
 Na na na naaaaa
 Na na na na na na naaaaa
 
 Hoy me siento entre nubes, creo que voy a estallar
 y me enredo con las horas, ya no se si llegaras
 Al volver la vista te haces acercas ya
 Mi cuerpo se estremece al verte caminar
 radiante noche en mi piel
 mi corazon se agita, vuelvo a renacer
 
 Esta noche voy contigo a bailar,
 el momento es nuestro y no termina
 Esta noche voy contigo a so'ar,
 que la vida es ritmo, es alegria
 Esta noche voy contigo a bailar,
 el estar contigo me hace libre
 Esta noche voy contigo a so'ar,
 que el amor es nuestro y no termina
 
 Na na na naaaaa
 Na na na naaaaa
 Na na na na na na naaaaa
 
 De regreso, voy contenta, tengo ganas de gritar
 si tu quieres, debo verte, no mas me dices y ya
 y comenzo -- en la oscuridad
 la energia en nuestro cuerpo nunca parara
 este es el ritmo , el que me hace vibrar
 y aunque quisiera detenerme no puedo parar
 
 Esta noche voy contigo a bailar,
 el momento es nuestro y no termina
 Esta noche voy contigo a so'ar,
 que la vida es ritmo, es alegria
 Esta noche voy contigo a bailar,
 el estar contigo me hace libre
 Esta noche voy contigo a so'ar,
 que el amor es nuestro y no termina
 Esta noche voy contigo a bailar,
 el momento es nuestro y no termina
 Esta noche voy contigo a so'ar,
 que la vida es ritmo, es alegria
 Esta noche voy contigo a bailar,
 el estar contigo me hace libre
 Esta noche voy contigo a so'ar,
 que el amor es nuestro y no termina
 
 Empezar a amar
 descubrir esta verdad
 que recien ya te conozco
 y ya no hay mas.
 Y es pensar, sentir
 que eres tu mi ultimo fin
 dulce imagen que solto un video-clip.
 Creeme que te quiero
 que en mi eres VIP
 la ternura en mi espejo
 que me sonrie feliz.
 Porque se que este amor es lo mas bello del mundo
 desato el corazon
 para amar cada segundo
 porque se que este amor que es tan mio como tuyo
 no es pasion sin querer
 trapecista sin red
 en los dos, en los dos.
 A la luz del sol 
 yo te canto esta cancion
 que te dice que me has puesto ya match- point.
 El dolor se fue de tu cielo de una vez
 si me dices te amo me siento muy bien
 me vistes en la clase
 o frente al televisor
 repitiendo tu nombre
 o escribiendolo en un...
 Porque se que este amor es lo mas bello del mundo
 desato el corazon
 para amar cada segundo
 porque se que este amor que es tan mio como tuyo
 no es pasion sin querer
 trapecista sin red
 en los dos, en los dos
 
 Ya se que no vendr's
 Todo lo que fue
 El tiempo lo dejo atr's
 Se que no regresaras
 Lo que nos paso
 No repetir' jam's
 Mil a'os no me alcanzaran
 Para borrarte y olvidar
 Y ahora estoy aqu'
 Queriendo convertir
 Los campos en ciudad
 Mezclando el cielo con el mar
 Se que te deje escapar
 Se que te perd'
 Nada podr' ser igual
 Mil a'os pueden alcanzar
 Para que pueda perdonar
 
 Estoy aqu' queri'ndote
 Ahog'ndome
 Entre fotos y cuadernos
 Entre cosas y recuerdos
 Que no puedo comprender
 Estoy enloqueci'ndome
 Cambi'ndome un pie por
 Cara m'a
 Esta noche por el d'a
 Y nada le puedo yo hacer
 
 Las cartas que escrib'
 Nunca las envi'
 No querr's saber de mi
 No puedo entender
 Lo tonta que fui
 Es cuesti'n de tiempo y fe
 Mil a'os con otros mil mas
 Son suficientes para amar
 
 Estoy aqu' queri'ndote
 Ahog'ndome
 Entre fotos y cuadernos
 Entre cosas y recuerdos
 Que no puedo comprender
 Estoy enloqueci'ndome
 Cambi'ndome un pie por
 Cara m'a
 Esta noche por el d'a
 
 Estoy aqu' queri'ndote
 Ahog'ndome
 Entre fotos y cuadernos
 Entre cosas y recuerdos
 Que estoy enloqueci'ndome
 Cambi'ndome un pie por
 Cara m'a
 Esta noche por el d'a
 
 Si aun piensas algo en mi
 Sabes que sigo esper'ndote
 
 Estoy aqu' queri'ndote
 Ahog'ndome
 Entre fotos y cuadernos
 Entre cosas y recuerdos
 Que estoy enloqueci'ndome
 Cambi'ndome un pie por
 Cara m'a
 Esta noche por el d'a
 
 Y que estoy aqu' queri'ndote
 Ahog'ndome
 Entre fotos y cuadernos
 Entre cosas y recuerdos
 Que estoy enloqueci'ndome
 Cambi'ndome un pie por
 Cara m'a
 Esta noche por el d'a
 Y estoy aqu' queri'ndote
 
 I already know you won't come
 And that time has left behind
 Everything that was
 
 I know you're not coming back
 And what we had
 Will never happen again
 
 A thousand years won't be enough for me
 To erase you from my memory and forget
 
 And now I'm here
 Wanting to change
 Countryside into town
 And mixing the sky with the sea
 I know I left you escape
 I know I lost you
 Nothing can be the same
 A thousand years could be enough
 For you to forgive
 
 I'm  here, loving you, 
 Drowning
 In photos and books, 
 In objects and memories
 Which I can't understand
 I'm driving myself mad
 Swapping a foot for my own face,
 Tonight for the day
 And I can't do a thing
 
 The letters I wrote
 I never sent
 You didn't want to hear from me
 
 I can't understand
 How stupid I was
 It's a matter of time and faith
 
 A thousand years and a thousand more
 Are enough for love
 
 I'm here, loving you...
 
 If you still think about me
 You know I am still waiting for you
 
 I'm here, loving you...
 
 Hace tiempo que nos conocemos
 que estamos los dos
 en algo que parece una amistad.
 Compartimos mil secretos
 nos contamos mil cosas
 es hora de decirte la verdad.
 Algo nuevo estoy sintiendo
 mi corazon te quiere hablar
 que por ti esta latiendo
 y te quiere preguntar
 que vas ha hacer el resto de tu vida
 que vas ha hacer desde ahora y para siempre
 yo quiero saber
 si un milagro puede ser
 que este sueno sea
 el comienzo de un eterno amor.
 Yo quisiera que me acompanes
 que me cambies la vida
 quisiera verte en cada atardecer
 y que sepas que te extrano
 cada vez que te vas
 necesito tenerte cerca un poco mas.
 Yo no puedo estar fingiendo
 mi corazon no aguanta mas
 que por ti sigue latiendo
 y te quiere preguntar
 que vas ha hacer el resto de tu vida
 que vas ha hacer desde ahora y para siempre
 yo quiero saber
 si un milagro puede ser
 que este sueno sea
 el comienzo de un eterno amor
 
 Oh, you know I have seen
 A sky without sun
 A man with no nation
 Saints captive in chains
 A song with no name
 For lack of imagination
 Ya he ya he ya la he
 And I have seen
 Darker than ebony
 Ya he ya he ya la he
 You know it seems that I
 Without your eyes
 Could never be
 
 My one desire
 All I aspire
 Is in your eyes
 Forever to live
 Traveled all over
 Crossed lands and oceans
 There's nothing
 That I wouldn't give
 
 Came from Bahrein
 Got to Beirut
 Looking for someone
 Comparing to you
 Tearing down
 Windows and doors
 And I could not
 Find eyes like yours
 
 Rabboussamai fikarrajaii
 Fi ainaiha aralhayati
 Ati ilaika min haza lkaaouni
 Arjouka labbi labbi nidai
 
 Came from bahrein
 Got to beirut
 Looking for someone
 Comparing to you
 Tearing down
 Windows and doors
 And I could not
 Find eyes like yours
 
 Oh, you know I have seen
 A woman of means and rags
 And begging for pleasure
 Crossed a river of salt
 The specter I rode
 The ship that sank
 In the desert
 
 Ya he ya he ya la he
 And I have seen
 Darker than ebony
 Ya he ya he ya la he
 You know it seems that I
 Without your eyes
 Could never be
 
 My one desire
 All I aspire
 Is in your eyes
 Forever to live
 Traveled all over
 Crossed lands and oceans
 There's nothing
 That I wouldn't give
 
 Came from Bahrein

 Tell me lies
 Slap me on the face
 Just to improvise
 Do something really clever
 That'll make me hate your name forever
 
 You might swear
 You'd never touch a lady
 Well, let me say
 You're not too far from maybe
 Every day you find
 New ways to hurt me
 
 But I can't help it
 If I'm just a fool
 Always having my heart
 Set on you
 'Til the time
 You start changing
 The rules
 I'll keep chasing
 The soles of your shoes
 
 Fool
 
 God resigned from
 Hearing my old story
 Every night I'm paying
 Hell for glory
 I'm embarrassed but
 I'm much more sorry
 
 All this pain begins
 To feel like pleasure
 With my tears
 You'd make a sea of desert
 Salt my wounds
 And I'll keep
 Saying thank you
 
 But I can't help it
 If I'm just a fool
 Always having my heart
 Set on you
 'Til the time
 You start changing
 The rules
 I'll keep chasing
 The soles of your shoes
 
 Fool
 
 But I can't help it
 If I'm just a fool
 Always having my heart
 Set on you
 'Til the time
 You start changing
 The rules
 I'll keep chasing
 The soles of your shoes
 
 Fool
 I can't help it baby
 Fool
 I can't help it baby
 Fool
 I can't help it baby
 Fool
 I can't help it baby, baby
 
 Fool
 I'm a fool
 I'm a fool
 
 Pulso acelerado, tu cabeza va a estallar
 y tu corazon esta sangrando
 estas delirando, hasta te falta respirar
 estas cansado de estar solo con tu soledad
 Rompes la herida en tu pobre alma
 es que se te nota a simple vista 
 
 Necesitas alguien que te sale la pasion
 Te cubra la ilusion, te abra el corazon
 Tu necesitas de mi, de mi
 Yo necesito de ti, de ti
 Tu necesitas amor, de mi amor o ven aqui
 Tu necesitas de mi, de mi
 Yo necesito de ti, de ti
 Tu necesitas amor de mi amor o ven aqui 
 
 Como perdida en el desierto estoy
 extra'andote hasta morir
 siento que me falta el aire si no estas aqui
 nada me hace feliz
 no lo voy a resistir
 Nada lo consigo si no estas tu junto a mi
 mi television y mis amigos
 ya de fiesta a fiesta cada vez me aburro mas
 ya no se como estudiar, no me puedo concentrar 
 
 Tu necesitas de mi, de mi
 Yo necesito de ti, de ti
 Tu necesitas amor, de mi amor o ven aqui
 Tu necesitas de mi, de mi
 Yo necesito de ti de ti
 Tu necesitas amor de mi amor o ven aqui
 Tu necesitas de mi, de mi
 Yo necesito de ti, de ti
 Tu necesitas amor de mi amor o ven aqui
 Tu necesitas de mi, de mi
 Yo necesito de ti de ti
 Tu necesitas amor de mi amor o ven aqui
 
 Nunca us' un antifaz
 Voy de paso
 Por este mundo fugaz
 
 No pretendo parar
 'Dime qui'n camina
 Cuando se puede volar?
 
 Mi destino es andar
 Mis recuerdos
 Son una estela en el mar
 
 Lo que tengo, lo doy
 Digo lo que pienso
 T'mame como soy
 
 Y va liviano
 Mi coraz'n gitano
 Que solo entiende de latir
 A contramano
 No intentes amarrarme
 Ni dominarme
 Yo soy quien elige
 Como equivocarme
 
 Aprovechame
 que si llegu' ayer
 Me puedo ir ma'ana
 Que soy gitana
 Que soy gitana
 
 Sigo siendo aprendiz
 En cada beso
 Y con cada cicatriz
 
 Algo pude entender
 De tanto que tropiezo
 Ya s' como caer
 
 Y va liviano
 Mi coraz'n gitano
 Que solo entiende de latir
 A contramano
 No intentes amarrarme
 Ni dominarme
 Yo soy quien elige
 Como equivocarme
 
 Aprovechame
 Que si llegu' ayer
 Me puedo ir ma'ana
 Que soy gitana
 
 Vamos y vemos
 Que la vida es un goce
 Es normal que le temas
 A lo que no conoces
 
 T'mame y vamos
 Que la vida es un goce
 Es normal que le temas
 A lo que no conoces
 Quiero verte volar
 Quiero verte volar
 
 Y va liviano
 Mi coraz'n gitano
 Que solo entiende de latir
 A contramano
 No intentes amarrarme
 Ni dominarme
 Yo soy quien elige
 Como equivocarme
 
 Aprovechame
 Que si llegu' ayer
 Me puedo ir ma'ana
 Que soy gitana
 
 How you doin' I'm Mr. Mos I'm back

 You can go up my crane girl
 And I'm a go down that drain girl
 Hey ah midnight cowboy

 Ha ha my girl is a queen

 Got this she wolf appetite that keeps me up all night
 You know the way it works don't be afraid to ask
 Aim high when the target is low
 F-Y-I I am ready to go
 People say men are just like kids
 Never saw a kid behave like this
 
 What you give is exactly what you receive
 So put me in a cage and lock me away
 And I'll play the games that you want me to play
 
 You can have it all
 Anything you want you can make it yours
 Anything you want in the world
 Anything you want in the world
 Give it up to me
 
 Nothing too big or small
 Anything you want you can make it yours
 Anything you want in the world
 Anything you want in the world
 Give it up to me

 Or do you prefer to fly
 All of the roads are open
 In your life
 In your life
 Give it up to me

 Or do you prefer to fly
 All of the roads are open
 In your life

 Nothing too big or small
 Anything you want you can make it yours
 Anything you want in the world
 Anything you want in the world
 Give it up to me
 
 Tell me all your wishes
 I am here to make them true, don't wonder
 You don't have to rub a lamp
 'Cause I'll take care of you
 
 Nobody knows, nobody knows
 Nobody knows, nobody knows
 
 Tell me what you think I'm one the kind
 You know a girl like me is difficult to find
 I bet you've never seen nothing like this before
 I bet you've never met someone who loved you more
 
 You know that I'm a witch and I can read your mind boy
 Where do I have to sign
 I'm on a board
 
 My new resolution is to trust you
 My business to love you until you've had it
 I'm not gonna miss out on the good stuff
 The grass is much greener with us on it
 
 Better than to sail on the Mediterranean Sea
 Better than to get a fancy Gucci dress for free
 
 Don't think it over
 Think it over
 Don't think it over
 Think it over
 
 Totally up to you, what you do with me
 I'm gonna make it up to us and you will see
 Don't have to prove it, it is written in your eyes
 Tonight you'll be the winner I will be the prize
 
 You know that I'm a witch and I can read your mind boy
 I know just what you want,
 And I like that
 
 My new resolution is to trust you
 My business to love you until you've had it
 I'm not gonna miss out on the good stuff
 The grass is much greener with us on it
 
 Watch my body get low uh
 As low as it can go uh
 All the boys will follow uh
 I'll show you something you don't know
 
 Watch my body get low uh

 Yo no quiero un erudito, ni a un millonario
 Sino a uno como te con ese vocabulario
 Contigo yo pierdo hasta mis buenos modales
 Aunque terminemos como dos animales
 Mu'vete, mu'vete como un invertebrado
 Soy tu cazadora y tu eres mi venado
 
 Si mamita yo soy como Bambi, tu venadito
 Dale, c'llate y ponte de ladito
 
 Esto a ti te va a calentar

 Eso que me dices tu, eso
 Son palabras bonitas dedicadas llenas de amor para mi
 
 Eso que me dices te, eso

 Oye, oye, oye
 
 Perversi'n absoluta en el 'rea
 Perverso como tener sexo en una funeraria
 Yo soy el jefe, y yo la secretaria
 Deja que te saque tu lado de ordinaria
 Shaki te estas bien bonita
 Aunque tambi'n me gustabas cuando estabas mas gordita
 Con el pelito negrito y la cara redondita
 Y as' medio rockerita
 Tambi'n me gustas ahora, pero cuando pierdes los modales
 Cuando comes sin cubiertos 
 Cuando se te sale lo sucio, lo obsceno
 Todo lo que sabe bueno, todo el veneno
 Si yo soy criminal 
 Vamos a tirarnos los dos del mismo puente
 Sin paraca'das de nuestro mundo volando
 
 Eso que me dices te, eso
 Son palabras bonitas dedicadas llenas de amor para mi
 
 Esto a ti te va a calentar

 Esto a ti, a ti, te va a calentar

 Me gusta que me mires como una delincuente
 Soy Caperucita, y te eres el lobo que miente
 Inv'tame a pasarme por el lado salvaje
 Donde yo no tenga que llevar maquillaje
 
 Puedo decirte todo, todo lo que pienso
 Soy peor que te, y si me buscas yo te encuentro
 
 Chiquita rica que me rasca cuando pica chica
 Chiquito dame un pico chico en el hocico rico
 Yo poco a poco  te toco un poco 
 Tarara tarara tara tarara

 Broke my heart
 On the road
 Spent the weekend
 Sewing the pieces back on
 
 Friends and thoughts pass me by
 Walking gets too boring
 When you learn how to fly
 
 Not the homecoming kind
 Take the top off
 And who knows what you might find
 
 Won't confess all my sins
 You can bet I'll try it
 But you can't always win
 
 'Cause I'm a gypsy
 Are you coming with me?
 I might steal your clothes
 And wear them if they fit me
 I never made agreements
 Just like a gypsy
 And I won't back down
 'Cause life's already bit me
 And I won't cry
 I'm too young to die
 If you're gonna quit me
 'Cause I'm a gypsy
 'Cause I'm a gypsy
 
 I can't hide
 What I've done
 Scars remind me
 Of just how far that I've come
 To whom it may concern
 Only run with scissors
 When you want to get hurt
 
 'Cause I'm a gypsy
 Are you coming with me?
 I might steal your clothes
 And wear them if they fit me
 I don't make agreements
 Just like a gypsy
 And I won't back down
 'Cause life's already bit me
 And I won't cry
 I'm too young to die
 If you're gonna quit me
 'Cause I'm a gypsy
 
 I said hey you
 You're no fool
 If you say "no"
 Ain't it just the way life goes?
 People fear what they don't know
 
 Come along for the ride oh yeah
 Come along for the ride ooh
 
 'Cause I'm a gypsy
 Are you coming with me?
 I might steal your clothes
 And wear them if they fit me
 I never made agreements
 Just like a gypsy
 I won't back down
 'Cause life's already bit me
 And I won't cry
 I'm too young to die
 If you're gonna quit me
 'Cause I'm a gypsy
 
 Ay mi bien, que no hara yo por ti
 Por tenerte un segundo, alejados del mundo y cerquita de m
 Ay mi bien, como el ro Magdalena
 Que se funde en la arena del mar, quiero fundirme yo en ti
 
 Hay amores que se vuelven resistentes a los daos
 Como el vino que mejora con los aos
 As crece lo que siento yo por ti
 
 Hay amores que se esperan al invierno y florecen
 Y en las noches del otoo reverdecen
 Tal como el amor que siento yo por ti
 
 Ay mi bien, no te olvides del mar
 Que en las noches me ha visto llorar, tantos recuerdos de ti
 Ay mi bien, no te olvides del da
 Que separ en tu vida de la pobre vida que me toc vivir
 
 Hay amores que se vuelven resistentes a los daos
 Como el vino que mejora con los aos
 As crece lo que siento yo por ti
 
 Hay amores que parece que se acaban y florecen
 Y en las noches del otoo reverdecen
 Tal como el amor que siento yo por ti
 Yo por ti, por ti, como el amor que siento yo por ti
 
 I'd like to be the kind of dream you'd never share
 To be your boss and to be your maid
 Your shaving cream
 Your razor blade 
 The buttons off your shirt, your favorite underwear
 
 I'd like to be the only thing on Earth that makes you cry
 The only thing that makes you happy
 Soon you will see 
 That no one else but me can take you this high
 And soon you'll make your last name mine
 
 Hey you, I'm makin' an offer that no one could ever refuse
 Don't play the adamant
 Don't be so arrogant
 Can't you see I've fallen for you?
 
 Hey you, I'm makin' an offer that no one would dare to refuse
 Don't play the adamant 
 Don't be so arrogant
 Let me in, let me be your muse tonight
 Tonight
 Tonight
 
 I'd like to the first white hair upon your head
 To be your cherry pie, your daily bread
 I'll cook for free
 I'll make your bed
 If I can know the things you thought and never said
 
 I'd like to be the owner of the zipper on your jeans
 And that thing that makes you happy
 I'd like to be the beginning, the end and the in-between
 And be your slave and be your queen
 
 Hey you, I'm makin' an offer that no one could ever refuse
 Don't play the adamant
 Don't be so arrogant
 Can't you see I've fallen for you?
 
 Hey you, I'm makin' an offer that no one would dare to refuse
 Don't play the adamant
 Don't be so arrogant
 Let me in, let me be your muse tonight

 Hey you, I'm makin' an offer that no one could ever refuse

 Let me in, let me be your muse
 Be your muse tonight
 
 Ladies up in here tonight
 No fighting
 We got the refugees up in here 
 No fighting
 
 Shakira, Shakira
 
 I never really knew that she could dance like this
 She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
 Como se llama 
 Bonita 
 Mi casa , su casa
 
 Oh baby when you talk like that
 You make a woman go mad
 So be wise  and keep on 
 Reading the signs of my body 
 
 And I'm on tonight you know my hips don't lie
 And I'm starting to feel it's right
 All the attraction, the tension
 Don't you see baby, this is perfection
 
 Hey Girl, I can see your body moving
 And it's driving me crazy
 And I didn't have the slightest idea
 Until I saw you dancing
 
 And when you walk up on the dance floor
 Nobody cannot ignore
 The way you move your body, girl 
 And everything so unexpected, the way you right and left it
 So you can keep on shaking it
 
 I never really knew that she could dance like this
 She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
 Como se llama 
 Bonita 
 Mi casa , su casa
 
 Oh baby when you talk like that
 You make a woman go mad
 So be wise  and keep on 
 Reading the signs of my body 
 
 And I'm on tonight you know my hips don't lie 
 And I am starting to feel you boy
 Come on lets go, real slow
 Don't you see baby asi es perfecto
 
  I know I am on tonight
 My hips don't lie and I am starting to feel it's right
 All the attraction, the tension
 Don't you see baby, this is perfection 
 
 Oh boy, I can see your body moving
 Half animal, half man
 I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
 But you seem to have a plan
 My will and self restraint
 Have come to fail now, fail now
 See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
 That's a bit too hard to explain
 
 Baila en la calle de noche
 Baila en la calle de d'a
 
 Baila en la calle de noche
 Baila en la calle de d'a
 
 I never really knew that she could dance like this
 She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
 Como se llama 
 Bonita 
 Mi casa , su casa
 
 Oh baby when you talk like that
 You know you got me hypnotized
 So be wise and keep on
 Reading the signs of my body
 
 Se'orita,
 Feel the conga, let me see you move like you come from Colombia
 
 Mira en Barranquilla se baila as', say it!
 En Barranquilla se baila as'
 
 Yeah, she's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee
 Like me back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country
 I go back like when Pac carried crates
 For Humpty Humpty we need a whole club dizzy
 Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
 I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
 No more do we snatch ropes
 Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats 
 
 I'm on tonight
 My hips don't lie and I am starting to feel you boy
 Come on lets go, real slow
 Baby like this is perfecto 
 
 Oh, you know I am on tonight
 My hips don't lie and I am starting to feel it's right
 The attraction
 The tension
 Baby, like this is perfection
 
 No fighting
 No fighting
 
 What language do you speak
 If you speak at all?
 Are you some kind of freak
 Who lives to raise the ones who fall?
 
 Hey, would you tell me why
 The cat fights the dog?
 Do you go to the mosque
 Or the synagogue?
 
 And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
 And if you wrote the script then why the troublemakers?
 
 How do you do, how does it feel to be so high and are you happy?
 Do you ever cry?
 Are you sometimes shy?
 You've made mistakes, well that's okay'cause we all have but if I forgive yours
 Will you forgive mine?
 
 Hey, do you feel our pain
 And walk in our shoes?
 Have you ever felt starved
 Or is your belly always full?
 
 How many people die
 And hurt in your name?
 Hey, does that make you proud
 Or does it bring you shame?
 
 And if our fates have all been wrapped around your finger
 And if you wrote the script then why the troublemakers?
 
 How do you do, how does it feel to be so high and are you happy?
 Do you ever cry?
 Are you sometimes shy?
 You've made mistakes, well that's okay'cause we all have but if I forgive yours
 Will you forgive mine?
 
  
   
   
   
 
  
   
  
 
 How do you do, how does it feel to be so high and are you happy?
 Do you ever cry?
 Are you sometimes shy?
 You've made mistakes, well that's okay'cause we all have but if I forgive yours
 Will you forgive mine?
 
 Will you forgive mine? 
 
 How do you do, how does it feel to be so high and are you happy?
 Do you ever cry?
 Are you sometimes shy?
 You've made mistakes, well that's okay'cause we all have but if I forgive yours
 Will you forgive mine?
 
 Who would have thought that you could hurt me?
 The way you've done it
 So deliberate, so determined
 
 Since you have been gone
 I bite my nails for days and hours
 And question my own questions on and on
 
 Tell me now, tell me now
 Why you're so far away
 When I'm still so close
 
 You don't even know the meaning of the words 'I'm sorry'
 You said you would love me until you die
 And as far as I know, you're still alive, baby
 
 You don't even know the meaning of the words 'I'm sorry'
 I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
 
 I tried so hard to be attentive
 To all you wanted, always supportive, always patient
 What did I do wrong?
 I'm wondering for days and hours
 It's clear it isn't here where you belong
 
 Anyhow, anyhow
 I wish you both all of best
 I hope you get along
 
 You don't even know the meaning of the words 'I'm sorry'
 You said you would love me until you die
 And as far as I know, you're still alive, baby
 
 You don't even know the meaning of the words 'I'm sorry'
 I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
 
 You don't even know the meaning of the words 'I'm sorry'
 You said you would love me until you die
 And as far as I know, you're still alive, baby
 
 You don't even know the meaning of the words 'I'm sorry'
 I'm starting to believe it should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
 
 Open heart, open heart
 It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
 Open heart, open heart
 It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart
 
 Si es cuesti'n de confesar
 No s' preparar caf'
 Y no entiendo de f'tbol
 Creo que alguna vez fui infiel
 Juego mal hasta el parqu's
 Y jam's uso reloj
 
 Y para ser m's franca nadie piensa en ti 
 Como lo hago yo
 Aunque te d' lo mismo
 
 Si es cuesti'n de confesar
 Nunca duermo antes de diez
 Ni me ba'o los domingos
 La verdad es que tambi'n
 Lloro una vez al mes
 Sobre todo cuando hay fr'o
 
 Conmigo nada es f'cil
 Ya debes saber
 Me conoces bien
 
 El cielo est' cansado ya de ver
 La lluvia caer
 Y cada d'a que pasa es uno m's
 Parecido a ayer
 No encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte porque
 Seguir am'ndote 
 Es inevitable
 
 Siempre supe que es mejor
 Cuando hay que hablar de dos
 Empezar por uno mismo
 Ya sabr's la situaci'n
 Aqu' todo est' peor
 Pero al menos a'n respiro
 
 No tienes que decirlo
 No vas a volver
 Te conozco bien
 
 El cielo est' cansado ya de ver
 La lluvia caer
 Y cada d'a que pasa es uno m's
 Parecido a ayer
 No encuentro forma alguna de olvidarte porque
 Seguir am'ndote 
 Es inevitable
 
 Siempre supe que es mejor
 Cuando hay que hablar de dos
 Empezar por uno mismo
 
 To be true I must confess
 Making coffee I'm a mess
 Don't know anything about football.
 Been unfaithful once or twice
 Cannot even win at dice
 As for watches, I don't use one.
 To be completely honest,
 No one thinks of you
 Quite the way I do...
 It's all the same to you now.
 
 To be true I must confess
 I never sleep at twelve or less
 Never take a bath on Sundays.
 Since I'm telling you so much
 I cry in earnest once a month
 When the weather turns to freezing.
 With me nothing is easy
 Only you can tell
 You know me so well...
 Without you everything's a bore.
 
 Chorus:
 The sky is seeing a million raindrops fall
 The hours seem to crawl
 And every day that passes is just the same
 Just like yesterday.
 I can't find anyway to forget you because
 To keep on loving you
 Is inevitable.
 
 I always felt that it was true
 When we talk about we two
 I should be the first revealing.
 Sure you know what's going on
 Nothing's better since you're gone
 At least I'm still breathing.
 And you won't be returning
 Nothing left to tell
 I know you so well...
 What will I ever do without you?
 
 Chorus
 
 I always felt that it was true
 When we talk about we two
 I should be the first revealing...
 
 I don't have to leave anymore
 What I have is right here
 Spend my nights and days before
 Searching the world for what's right here
 
 Underneath and unexplored
 Islands and cities I have looked
 Here I saw
 Something I couldn't over look
 
 I am yours now
 So now I don't ever have to leave
 I've been found out
 So now I'll never explore
 See what I've done
 That bridge is on fire
 Go back to where I've been
 I'm froze by desire
 No need to leave
 
 Where would I be
 If this were to go under
 It's a risk I'd take
 I'm froze by desire
 As if a choice I'd make?
 
 I am yours now
 So now I don't ever have to leave
 I've been found out
 So now I'll never explore
 I am yours now, I am yours now
 So now I don't ever have to leave
 I've been found out, I've been found out
 So now I'll never explore
 
 See what I've done
 
 I'm ready, I'm ready
 Check, 'Clef, to, rock
 Hey I'm dancin with this girl, you find your own girl
 
 It's still no fightin tonight though homey
 Geyeah, it's all love tonight
 
 My love good for all season, winter summer fall spring
 I got de summer time flow, ting-a-ling-a-ling
 Columbian swing when Shaki' do her t'ing
 One bright feed de power like Lords of the Ring
 Many fight fi the crown, but there's only one King
 Many girls want the title, but there's only one Queen
 One King for the Queen, one Queen for the King!
 I don't wanna wake up if this thing is a dream
 
 If you have no home, I'll be your shelter
 Baby don't be scared
 If you lost your sight, I would be your eyes
 Lead you in the spotlight
 If you've enough time, I will be one time
 Only to be with you tonight
 But ever is never, never enough time
 To make it forever mine
 
 Time after time, you get better like fine wine
 I look into your eyes and see your soul in the skyline
 Call me Mr. Freeze I feel a chill in my spineline
 Cause every time you touch me, it's like a divine sign
 Many fight fi the crown, but there's only one King
 Many girls want the title, but there's only one Queen
 One King for the Queen, one Queen for the King~!
 I don't wanna wake up if this thing is a dream
 
 If you have no home, I'll be your shelter
 Baby don't be scared
 If you lost your sight, I would be your eyes
 Lead you in the spotlight
 If you've enough time, I will be one time
 Only to be with you tonight
 But ever is never, never enough time
 To make it forever mine
 
 And I don't wanna, put out this fire
 Transition {?} momma
 I feel my place where the soul get higher
 Nights get cold I gotta hold ya
  slept in the middle of the sofa
  and a loafer, but we had each other
 Christmas throw Santa down the chimney
 Felt like Pookie from New Jack when he got the turkey
 Cause we those ReFugees, survive the tsunami
 So ain't nobody gonna tell me this ain't what I need
 
 If you have no home, I'll be your shelter
 Baby don't be scared
 If you lost your sight, I would be your eyes
 Lead you in the spotlight
 If you've enough time, I will be one time
 Only to be with you tonight
 But ever is never, never enough time
 To make it forever mine
 
 Shaki', 'Clef, Jerry Wonder what we tell 'em boy
 
 Yo Cliff, let the horns go
 
 I'm gonna obey all your wishes as if
 They were orders
 I'm gonna dye your body in kisses
 While we're growing older
 I'll be there to beat your fears in all the
 Three hundred sixty five days a year
 
 So this is what I say
 
 Knock on my door
 You know I'll be in town

 Sunniest sundays

 Only three hundred sixty five days a
 Year
 
 So this is what I say
 
 Knock on my door

 You can consider it done
 
 Knock on my door

 Don't let me down
 You know I'll be in town
 
 Nada voy a hacer 
 Rebuscando en las heridas del pasado 
 No voy a perder 
 Yo no quiero ser un tipo de otro lado 
 
 A tu manera, descomplicado 
 En una bici que te lleve a todos lados 
 Un vallenato desesperado 
 Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escrib' 
 Que te sue'o y que te quiero tanto 
 Que hace rato est' mi coraz'n 
 Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti 
 La que yo guardo donde te escrib' 
 Que te sue'o y que te quiero tanto 
 Que hace rato est' mi coraz'n 
 Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti 
 
 Puedo ser feliz 
 Caminando relajada entre la gente 
 Yo te quiero as' 
 Y me gustas porque eres diferente 
 
 A mi manera, despelucado 
 En una bici que me lleva a todos lados 
 Un vallenato desesperado 
 Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escrib' 
 Que te sue'o y que te quiero tanto 
 Que hace rato est' mi coraz'n 
 Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti 
 La que yo guardo donde te escrib' 
 Que te sue'o y que te quiero tanto 
 Que hace rato est' mi coraz'n 
 Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti 
 
 Ella es la favorita, la que canta en la zona 
 Se mueve en su cadera como un barco en las olas 
 Tiene los pies descalzos como un ni'o que adora 
 Y sus cabellos largos son un sol que te antoja 
 Le gusta que le digan que es la ni'a, la lola 
 Le gusta que la miren cuando ella baila sola 
 Le gusta m's la casa, que no pasen las horas 
 Le gusta Barranquilla, le gusta Barcelona 
 
 Lleva, ll'vame en tu bicicleta 
 'yeme, Carlos, ll'vame en tu bicicleta 
 Quiero que recorramos juntos esa zona 
 Desde Santa Marta hasta La Arenosa 
 Lleva, ll'vame en tu bicicleta 
 Pa' que juguemos bola 'e trapo all' en Chancleta 
 Que si a Pique alg'n d'a le muestras el Tayrona 
 Despu's no querr' irse pa' Barcelona 
 
 A mi manera, descomplicado 
 En una bici que me lleva a todos lados 
 Un vallenato desesperado 
 Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escrib' 
 Que te sue'o y que te quiero tanto

 Latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti 
 La que yo guardo donde te escrib' 
 Que te sue'o y que te quiero tanto

 Feel how the planet, become one
 Beats like a drum to the same rhythm
 Hear the whistle, kick the ball
 The entire world soars like an eagle
 In Rio we play, like we dance
 Only today there's no tomorrow
 Leave all behind, in this place
 There's no space for fear or sorrow
 
 Is it true that you want it?
 Then act like you mean it
 With everyone watching
 It's truth or dare, can you feel it?
 
 La la la la la

 You have arrived, it's the place
 No more doubts the time is coming
 Feel how the planet, become one
 Like a drum destiny's calling
 German, Colombians, Spanish and French
 Off the bench you gotta own it
 Down here we play, like we dance
 It's Brazil and now you know it
 
 Is it true that you want it?
 Then act like you mean it
 With everyone watching
 It's truth or dare, can you feel it?
 
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la I dare you
 
 Is it true that you want it?
 Then act like you mean it
 The hole world is watching
 It's truth or dare, can you feel it?
 
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la I dare you

 Eres como una predicci'n de las buenas
 Eres como una dosis alta en las venas
 
 Y el deseo gira en espiral
 Porque mi amor por ti es total
 Y es para siempre
 
 Despu's de ti la pared
 No me faltes nunca
 Debajo el asfalto
 Y m's abajo estar'a yo
 
 Despu's de ti la pares
 No me faltes nunca
 Debajo el asfalto
 Y m's abajo estar'a yo
 Sin ti
 
 Eres la enfermedad y el enfermero
 Y ya me has convertido
 En tu perro faldero
 Sabes que sin ti
 Ya yo no soy
 Sabes que a donde vayas voy
 
 Naturalmente
 Despu's de ti la pared
 No me faltes nunca
 Debajo el asfalto
 Y m's abajo estar'a yo
 
 Despu's de ti la pares
 No me faltes nunca
 Debajo el asfalto
 Y m's abajo estar'a yo
 Sin ti
 
 The Wall
 
 You're like a good weather forecast
 You're like a straight shot to the vein
 
 And lust spins in a spiral
 Because my love for you is total
 And it's forever
 
 After you, the wall
 Don't ever let me be without you
 Beneath the asphalt
 And even deeper down I'd be
 After you, the wall
 Don't ever let me be without you
 Beneath the asphalt
 And even deeper down I'd be
 Without you
 
 You're my sickness and my nurse
 And you've already turned me 
 Into your faithful dog
 
 You know that without you
 I no longer am
 You know wherever you go, I go
 Naturally
 
 After you, the wall
 Don't ever let me be without you
 Beneath the asphalt 
 And even deeper down I'd be
 After you, the wall
 Don't ever let me be without you
 Beneath the asphalt
 And even deeper down I'd be
 Without you
 
 After you, the wall
 Don't ever let me be without you
 Beneath the asphalt 
 And even deeper down I'd be
 After you, the wall
 Don't ever let me be without you
 Beneath the asphalt 
 And even deeper down I'd be
 Without you
 Without you
 
 Ay padrita m'a
 Gu'rdate la poes'a
 Gu'rdate la alegr'a pa' ti
 
 Dame, dame, d'melo, oh
 
 No pido que todos los d'as sean de sol
 No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
 Tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perd'n
 Si lloras con los ojos secos
 Y hablando de ella
 
 Ay amor me duele tanto
 Me duele tanto
 Que te fueras sin decir a donde
 Ay amor, fue una tortura perderte
 
 Yo s' que no he sido un santo
 Pero lo puedo arreglar amor
 
 No solo de pan vive el hombre
 Y no de excusas vivo yo
 
 Solo de errores se aprende
 Y hoy se que es tuyo mi coraz'n
 
 Mejor te guardas todo eso
 A otro perro con ese hueso
 Y nos decimos adi's
 
 Esto es otra vez esto es otra vez no
 
 No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
 No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
 No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
 Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas
 
 Ay amor me duele tanto
 Me duele tanto
 Que no creas m's en mis promesas
 Ay amor
 Es una tortura
 Perderte
 
 Yo se que no he sido un santo
 Pero lo puedo arreglar amor
 
 No solo de pan vive el hombre
 Y no de excusas vivo yo
 
 Solo de errores se aprende
 Y hoy se que es tuyo mi coraz'n
 
 Mejor te guardas todo eso
 A otro perro con ese hueso
 Y nos decimos adi's
 
 No te bajes, no te rajes
 Oye negrita mira, no te rajes
 De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
 D'jame el s'bado a mi que es mejor
 Oye mi negra no me castigues m's
 Porque all' afuera sin ti no tengo paz
 Yo solo soy un hombre arrepentido
 Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido
 
 Yo se que no he sido un santo
 Y es que no estoy hecho de cart'n
 
 No solo de pan vive el hombre
 Y no de excusas vivo yo
 
 Solo de errores se aprende
 Y hoy se que es tuyo mi coraz'n
 
 Ay ay ay ay ay
 Ay, todo lo que he hecho por ti
 Una tortura perderte
 Me duele tanto que sea as'
 Sigue llorando perd'n
 Yo, yo no voy
 A llorar por ti
 
 The Torture
 
 Hey baby girl
 Save your poetry
 Keep your poems and cheer to yourself
 
 I'm not asking that every day be sunny
 I'm not asking that there be a party every Friday
 Nor do I ask you to come back begging forgiveness 
 If you're crying with dry eyes
 Speaking about her
 
 Oh, my love, it hurts so much
 It hurts so much
 That you left without saying a word
 Oh, my love, losing you was torture
 
 I know I haven't been a saint
 But I can make it up to you
 
 Man doesn't live on bread alone
 Nor do I live on excuses
 
 We only learn from mistakes
 And today I know my heart is yours
 
 Better save that for yourself
 Take that bone to some other dog
 And let's say goodbye
 
 I can't ask winter to spare a rose bush
 I can't ask an elm tree to bear pears
 I can't ask the eternal of a mere mortal
 And go about casting thousands of pearls before swine
 
 Oh, my love, it hurts so much
 It hurts so much
 That you no longer trust my promises
 Oh, my love, losing you has been torture
 
 I know I haven't been a saint
 But I can make it up to you
 
 Man doesn't live on bread alone
 Nor do I live on excuses
 
 We only learn from mistakes
 And today I know my heart is yours
 
 Better save that for yourself
 Take that bone to some other dog
 And let's say goodbye
 
 Listen, baby, don't you go
 Listen, baby, don't get angry
 From Monday to Friday you have my love
 Give Saturday to me and you'll be better off
 Listen, baby, don't punish me anymore
 Without you, out there I have no peace
 
 I'm just a repentant man
 I'm the bird that returns to it's nest
 
 I know I haven't been a saint
 And I'm not made of stone
 
 Man doesn't live on bread alone
 Nor do I live on excuses
 
 We only learn from mistakes
 And today I know my heart is yours
 
 Oh, after all I've done for you
 It was such a torture to lose you
 It hurts me so that it's like this
 Keep on crying sorry
 I...
 I'm not going
 To cry over you
 
 No me preguntas m's por m'
 Si ya sabes cual es la respuesta
 Desde el momento en que te vi
 Se a lo que voy
 
 Yo me propongo ser de ti
 Una victima casi perfecta
 Yo me propongo ser de ti
 Un volc'n hoy
 
 El amor tal vez
 Es un mal com'n
 Y as' como ves
 Estoy viva aun
 Ser' cuesti'n de suerte
 
 Creo que empiezo a entender
 Despacio, despacio, comienzas a caer
 Que nos dese'bamos desde antes de nacer
 Te siento, te siento, desde antes de nacer
 Tengo el presentimiento de que empieza la acci'n
 Adentro, adentro, te vas quedando
 Y las mujeres somos las de la intuici'n
 As', estoy dispuesta a todo amor
 
 Yo te propongo un desliz
 Un error convertido en acierto
 Yo me propongo ser de ti
 Un volc'n hoy
 
 El amos tal vez
 Es mal com'n
 Y as' come ves
 Estoy viva aun
 Ser' cuesti'n de suerte
 
 Women's Intuition
 
 Don't ask for me anymore
 If you already know the answer
 From the moment I first saw you
 I knew where I was headed
 
 I propose to be to you
 An almost perfect victim
 I propose to be to you
 A volcano today
 
 Love perhaps
 Is a common affliction
 And as you will see
 I'm still alive
 It's a matter of luck
 
 I think I'm starting to understand
 Slowly, slowly, you'll start to fall
 That we desired each other before we were born
 I feel you, I feel you, since before being born
 I get the feeling the action is about to begin
 Inside, inside, you're going to stay
 And us women are the ones with intuition
 I'm ready for anything my love
 
 I propose we have an affair
 A mistake that will come out alright
 I propose to be to you
 A volcano today
 
 Love perhaps
 Is a common affliction
 And as you will see
 I'm still alive
 It's a matter of luck
 
 I think I'm starting to understand
 Slowly, slowly, you'll start to fall
 That we desired each other before we were born
 I feel you, I feel you, since before being born
 I get the feeling the action is about to begin
 Inside, inside, you're going to stay
 And us women are the ones with intuition
 I'm ready for anything
 
 I think I'm starting to understand
 Slowly, slowly, you'll start to fall
 That we desired each other before we were born
 I feel you, I feel you, since before being born
 I get the feeling the action is about to begin
 Inside, inside, you're going to stay
 And us women are the ones with intuition
 The ones with intuition
 
 Imaginar, yo tan solo puedo imaginar,
 que ya deje de verme ni'a
 Que llamaras, y me invitaras hoy a cenar,
 luego a bailar bajo la luna
 pero mil de esos sue'os no hacen realidad,
 un abismo en el que llego
 se que estoy muy lejos
 
 Imaginar, yo tan solo puedo imaginar,
 que tu me has hecho tu princesa
 Y una vez mas, sentire como me hago un mar,
 cubriendote --- de arena
 pero tanto que te pienso no te hara mirar,
 hoy me veo tan perdida
 por estar tan lejos...
 
 Lejos de tu amor, lejos de tu corazon,
 lejos de tu amor y sin salida, mire
 Lejos de tu amor, lejos de tu corazon,
 lejos de tu amor y sin salida, vuelve
 Imaginar, yo tan solo puedo imaginar,
 que ya deje de verme ni'a
 Que llamaras, y me invitaras hoy a cenar,
 luego a bailar bajo la luna
 pero tanto que te pienso no te hara mirar,
 hoy me veo tan perdida
 por estar tan lejos...
 
 Lejos de tu amor, lejos de tu corazon,
 lejos de tu amor y sin salida, mire
 Lejos de tu amor, lejos de tu corazon,
 lejos de tu amor y sin salida, vuelve
 
 RAP
 
 Lejos de tu amor, lejos de tu corazon,
 lejos de tu amor y sin salida, mire
 Lejos de tu amor, lejos de tu corazon,
 lejos de tu amor y sin salida, vuelve
 
 En la suite 16
 Lo que empieza no termina
 Del mini bar al eden
 Y en muy mala compa'a
 
 Era ese sabor en tu piel
 Azufre revuelto con miel
 Asi que me llene de coraje y me fui a caminar por el lado salvaje
 
 Pens' "no me mires as'"
 Ya s' lo que quieres de m'
 Que no hay que ser vidente aqu'
 Para un mal como t' no hay cuerpo que aguante
 
 Lo hecho est' hecho
 Volvi a tropezar con la misma piedra que hubo siempre
 Se siente tan bien todo lo que hace mal
 Y contigo nunca es suficiente
 
 Eh eh eh eh
 Ah ah ah ah
 Eh eh eh eh
 Ah ah ah ah
 
 C'mo fue 
 Qu' paso 
 Esa noche 
 Impaciente 
 Fueron a llamar 
 De la recepci'n 
 Cuando se quejaban 
 De la 17 
 
 No puedo hacer nada normal
 Acabar eligiendo tan mal 
 En materia de hombres soy toda una experta siempre en repetir mis errores
 
 No hay ceguera peor
 Que no querer mirar 
 Cuando te guardabas el anillo dentro del bolsillo y dejarlo pasar
 
 Lo hecho est' hecho
 Volvi a tropezar con la misma piedra que hubo siempre
 Se siente tan bien todo lo que hace mal
 Y contigo nunca es suficiente
 
 Eh eh eh eh
 Ah ah ah ah
 Eh eh eh eh
 Ah ah ah ah
 
 Nunca me sent' tan fuera de lugar
 Nunca tanto se escap' de mi control
 Pero todo en este mundo es temporal
 Lo eres t' y lo soy yo
 
 Nunca me sent' tan fuera de lugar
 Nunca tanto se escap' de mi control
 Pero todo en este mundo es temporal
 Y en eso no decido yo
 
 Lo hecho est' hecho
 Volvi a tropezar con la misma piedra que hubo siempre
 Se siente tan bien todo lo que hace mal
 Y contigo nunca es suficiente
 Se siente tan bien todo lo que hace mal
 
 Eh eh eh eh
 Ah ah ah ah
 Eh eh eh eh
 Ah ah ah ah
 
 Blei baby blei baby 
 Geh nicht wieder weg
 
 Blei baby blei baby 
 Geh nicht wieder weg 
 
 Una m'quina 
 De pensar en ti 
 Eso es lo que soy 
 Lo que siempre fui 
 
 Sabes que me est' matando esta espera cruel 
 La resignaci'n es un deseo sin piel 
 Y cada d'a llora algo muy dentro de mi 
 No hay forma l'gica de hacer mi vida sin ti 
 
 Y aunque me hagas la invencible 
 Lo fatal lo imprescindible 
 Es que vuelvas a mi, vuelvas a mi, vuelve
 El dolor es sofocante 
 Y ahora todo lo importante 
 Es que vuelvas a mi, vuelvas a mi, vuelve
 No me tortures as' 
 
 Una m'quina de vivir sin paz 
 Eso es lo que soy 
 Desde que no est's 
 Dices que no tiene caso reaccionar as' 
 Que has hecho tu elecci'n 
 Que viva y deje vivir 
 Pero no quiero romper el lazo que me ata a ti 
 Ten consideraci'n y no me dejes sufrir 
 
 Y aunque me haga la invencible
 Lo fatal lo imprescindible 
 Es que vuelvas a mi, vuelvas a mi, vuelve
 El dolor es sofocante 
 Y ahora todo lo importante 
 Es que vuelvas a mi, vuelvas a mi, vuelve
 No me tortures as' 
 
 Blei baby blei baby 
 Geh nicht wieder weg 
 
 Blei baby blei baby 
 Geh nicht wieder weg 
 
 Y aunque me haga la invencible
 Lo fatal lo imprescindible 
 Es que vuelvas a mi, vuelvas a mi, vuelve
 El dolor es sofocante 
 Y ahora todo lo importante 
 Es que vuelvas a mi, vuelvas a mi, vuelve
 No me tortures as'
 
 The Essential Thing
 
 Stay, baby, stay, baby
 Never leave again
 Stay, baby, stay, baby
 Never leave again
 
 A machine
 Designed to think of you
 That is what I am
 What I always was
 
 You know this cruel wait is killing me
 Resignation is a desire without skin
 Everyday something cries inside of me
 There's no logical way to build my life without you
 
 And although I make myself appear invincible
 What is fatal, what is essential
 Is that you come back to me, come back to me, come back
 The pain is suffocating
 And what's important now
 Is that you come back to me, come back to me, come back
 Don't torture me like this
 
 A machine
 Of living without peace
 That is what I am
 Since you've been gone
 
 You say there's no sense in reacting like this
 You've made your choice
 That I should live and let live
 
 And although I make myself appear invincible
 What is fatal, what is essential
 Is that you come back to me, come back to me, come back
 The pain is suffocating
 And what's important now
 Is that you come back to me, come back to me, come back
 Don't torture me like this
 
 Stay, baby, stay, baby
 Never leave again
 Stay, baby, stay, baby
 Never leave again
 
 And although I make myself appear invincible
 What is fatal, what is essential
 Is that you come back to me, come back to me, come back
 The pain is suffocating
 And what's important now
 Is that you come back to me, come back to me, come back
 Don't torture me like this
 
 Cu'ntas veces nos salv' el pudor
 Y mis ganas de siempre buscarte
 Pedacito de amor delirante
 Colgado de tu cuello un s'bado de lluvia a la cinco de la tarde
 
 Sabe Dios, c'mo me cuesta dejarte
 Y te miro mientras duermes, m's no voy a despertarte
 Es que hoy se me agot' la esperanza
 Porque con lo que nos queda de nosotros ya no alcanza
 
 Eres lo que m's he querido
 En la vida lo que mas he querido
 Eres lo que m's he querido en la vida
 Lo que m's he querido
 
 Cu'ntas veces quise hacerlo bien
 Y pequ' por hablar demasiado
 No saber d'nde, c'mo, ni cu'ndo
 Todos estos a'os caminando juntos
 Ahora no parecen tanto
 
 Sabe Dios, todo el amor que juramos
 Pero hoy nada es lo mismo
 Ya no vamos a enga'arnos
 Es que soy, una mujer en el mundo
 Que hizo todo lo que pudo
 No te olvides ni un segundo
 
 Que eres lo que m's he querido
 En la vida lo que m's he querido
 Eres lo que m's he querido en la vida
 Lo que m's he querido
 
 Sigilosa al pasar
 Sigilosa al pasar
 Esa loba es especial
 Mirala, caminar caminar
 
 Qui'n no ha querido a una diosa lic'ntropa
 En el ardor de una noche romantica
 Mis aullidos son el llamado
 Yo te quiero un lobo domesticado
 
 Por fin he encontrado un remedio infalible que borre del todo la culpa
 No pienso quedarme a tu lado mirando la tele y oyendo disculpas
 La vida me ha dado un hambre vor'z y tu apenas me das caramelos
 Me voy con mis piernas y mi juventud por ah' aunque te maten los celos
 
 Una loba en el armario
 Tiene ganas de salir
 Deja que se coma el barrio
 Antes de irte a dormir
 
 Tengo tacones de aguja magnetica
 Para dejar a la manada frenetica
 La luna llena como una fruta
 No da consejos ni los escucha
 
 Llevo conmigo un radar especial para localizar solteros
 Si acaso me meto en aprietos tambien llevo el n'mero de los bomberos
 Ni tipos muy lindos, ni divos, ni ni'os ricos, yo se lo que quiero
 Pasarla muy bien y portarme muy mal en los brazos de alg'n caballero
 
 Una loba en el armario
 Tiene ganas de salir
 Deja que se coma el barrio
 Antes de irte a dormir
 
 Cuando son casi la una la loba en celo saluda a la luna
 Duda si andar por la calle o entrar en un bar a probar fortuna
 Ya est' sentada en su mesa y pone la mira en su proxima presa
 Pobre del desprevenido que no se esperaba una de esas
 
 Sigilosa al pasar
 Sigilosa al pasar
 Esa loba es especial
 Mirala caminar, caminar
 
 Deja que se coma el barrio
 Antes de irte a dormir
 
 Loca 
 No te pongas bruto
 Loca
 
 Que te la bebe'
 Dance or die 
 
 El esta por mi y por ti borra
 Y eso que tu tienes to'
 Y yo ni un kika
 
 El esta por mi

 Y eso que tu tienes tu
 Y yo ni un kika
 
 Ella se hace la bruta pa' cotizar
 Cinco minutitos de su saldo del celu contigo
 Te cotorrea el oado pa' tenerte en alta
 Ella muere por ti, tu por mi es que matas.
 
 Sigo tranquila como una paloma de equina
 Mientras ella se pasa en su bm
 Mira yo de aqua no me voy, se que esta esta por ma
 Y ninguna va poder quit'rmelo de un tiran
 
 Yo soy loca con mi tigre
 Loca, loca, loca
 Soy loca con mi tigre
 Loca, loca, loca
 Soy loca con mi tigre

 Mientras ella te complace con todos tus caprichos
 Yo te llevo al malecan por un caminito
 Me dicen que tu novia anda con un rifle
 Porque te vio bailando mambo pa' mi
 A no lo permite?
 
 Yo no tengo la culpa de que tu te enamore
 Mientras a te compra flores yo compro condo' 
 
 Yo soy loca con mi tigre
 Cuanto mas rayas mejor
 Y mira, eso es lo que dicen

 You're the one for me
 I feel hurt no more
 Oh you think she got it all
 I got my key key
 
 But she doesn't know the things that I do to please you
 Take you to the medico por el caminito
 They saw your girlfriend looking for me with a rifle
 Cuz when we're dancin' Mambo,
 Why she tag along?
 
 I really can't help it if I make the lady loca
 I don't want no trouble, I just wanna hear the

 Yo sigo tranquila como una paloma de esquina
 Mientras ella se pasea en su BM al lado m'o
 Yo de aqu' no me voy, 'l est' pa' m'

 En la arena escrib'
 Lo que te llego amar
 Y a'n no lo borra
 Ni la sal de el mar
 
 Perm'teme so'ar
 Que todav'a estas aqu'
 Aun quiero seguir loca por ti
 
 Sigo sola aqu' en este parque
 Falta todo si faltas tu
 Imagino tu cuerpo aqu'
 Con la luna a contra luz
 Me quedare, bebiendo esta copa a tu salud
 
 Se que al amanecer
 Mis lagrimas caer'n
 Y entre la lluvia se confundir'n
 
 D'jame continuar
 Ebria y so'ando aqu'
 Sabiendo que estoy
 Loca por ti
 
 Sigo sola aqu' en este parque
 Falta todo si faltas tu
 Imagino tu cuerpo aqu'
 Con la luna a contra luz
 Me quedare, bebiendo esta copa a tu salud
 
 Sigo sola aqu' en este parque
 Falta todo si faltas tu
 Imagino tu cuerpo aqu'
 Con la luna a contra luz
 Y no me ir', sin antes brindar a tu salud
 
 Me bebo esta copa a tu salud
 
 Hold me
 Show me all the talent God has given you
 I want us thinking outside the box 
 Just keep on going
 
 You've done good things for me
 Though I'm not an easy girl to please
 I'll never run out of faith in you 
 Just keep on going
 
 Long time, baby long time
 That's the way I've loved you baby
 Long night it's been a long night
 I'm breaking the record, told ya
 
 Long time, baby long time
 The minutes are eternal lately
 Long night it's been a long night
 Can't wait to touch you, touch you
 
 I wish I had longer legs
 That I could fasten to your body so you'd take me with you everywhere
 And when you think I can take no more 
 Just keep on going
 
 If I let you have your way don't think I'm weak
 You got the stamina and the technique
 So let those eloquent hands of yours 
 Just keep on going
 
 Long time, baby long time
 That's the way I've loved you baby
 Long night it's been a long night
 I'm breaking the record, told ya
 
 Long time, baby long time
 The minutes are eternal lately
 Long night it's been a long night
 Can't wait to touch you, touch you
 
 This thing we've gots so rare
 It's so good it's not even fair
 So how could anything compare
 To your way, no way
 
 How can you do me so much good
 I'm so happy I should get sued
 But nothing matters next to you
 No way, no way
 
 Long time, long time
 That's the way I've loved you baby
 Long night it's been a long night
 I'm breaking the record, told ya
 
 Long time, baby long time
 The minutes are eternal lately
 Long night it's been a long night
 Can't wait to touch you, touch you
 
 Magia, siento magia,
 desde hace poco algo nuevo nace en mi
 Magia, siento magia,
 cuando me hablas tiemblo toda, es asi
 ando siempre despistada,
 no escucho lo que me hablan
 solo pienso en que estas cerca de mi
 
 Magia, tu mirada,
 como la luna me estremece hasta el fin
 Magia, siento magia,
 si estoy contigo en el desierto soy feliz
 Dicen que hasta veo fantasmas o que estoy emproblemada
 y la razon es que te quiero hasta morir
 
 Y es asi que ya no puedo ni dormir,
 me paso el dia pensando en ti
 vivo embrujada es por ti,
 y es asi que solo vivo para ti, no se estudiar
 ni se salir, no se que magia has hecho en mi
 
 Magia, siento magia,
 como la luna me estremece hasta el fin

 Y es asi...
 
 Mariposas vuelan a destiempo
 Coloriendo el cielo de abril
 Vuelan muy alto donde el viento lo decida
 Ni los a'os ni los contratiempos
 Nada me separa de ti
 Contigo me quedo
 Y me quedo de por vida
 
 Ya pateamos las piedras del camino
 El universo es mesquino
 Comparado con lo que me das
 
 Voy a insistir sin descansar
 Es una historia sin final
 Mi amor es sobrenatural
 
 Oh oh ah ah ah ah
 Oh oh ah ah ah ah
 
 Mariposas cuando estoy contigo
 Vuelan de mi ombligo hasta ti
 Son tantas cosas las que har's nacer en mi
 Quiero que mi vientre sea nido
 Siembra tu ternura en mi
 Son tantas cosas las que har' crecer en ti
 
 Caminando hicimos el camino
 Que hasta el futuro adivino
 Yo no doy puntada sin dedal
 
 Voy a insistir sin descansar
 Es una historia sin final
 Mi amor es sobrenatural
 Voy a insistir sin descansar
 Es una historia sin final
 Mi amor es sobrenatural
 
 Oh oh ah ah ah ah
 Oh oh ah ah ah ah
 Oh oh ah ah ah ah
 Oh oh ah ah ah ah
 
 Voy a insistir sin descansar
 Es una historia sin final
 Mi amor es sobrenatural
 Voy a insistir sin descansar
 Es una historia sin final
 Mi amor es sobrenatural
 
 Oh oh ah ah ah ah
 Oh oh ah ah ah ah
 Oh oh ah ah ah ah
 Oh oh ah ah ah ah

 And I feel again losing my mind
 Banging my head up against the wall
 Staring at nothing cause I can't sleep at night
 Can't make it stop, yeah I think too much
 What do I do? Falling apart
 I need a shock straight to my heart
 No one would want to be in my shoes right now, oh
 
 I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
 Straight on the rocks
 But you won't see me popping the pills
 Po-po-popping the pills
 Cause if I want the pain to go away
 In a second make it fade
 You're the only thing that will
 You're my medicine, medicine
 My medicine, medicine
 My medicine
 
 You know you're an expert at complicating things
 That's how I'm wired, believe me it's no fun
 But you make the war seem like such an easy game
 Keeps me and my arguments come under
 Down in the trenches, you are the white flag
 Make me surrender
 Want you so bad
 Baby don't stop what you started
 Don't ever be done, oh
 
 I always throw the bottle of whisky
 Straight on the rocks
 But you won't see me popping the pills
 Po-po-popping the pills
 Cause if I want the pain to go away
 In a second make it fade
 You're the only thing that will
 You're my medicine, medicine
 My medicine, medicine
 My medicine
 
 You make it all better, better
 You make me feel home
 You make it all better, better
 You make me feel home
 
 I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
 No you won't see me popping the pills
 Cause if I want the pain to go away
 In a second make it fade
 You're the only thing that will
 You're my medicine, medicine
 My medicine, medicine
 My medicine
 
 You make it all better, better
 You make me feel home
 You make it all better, better
 You make me feel home
 
 You make it all better, better
 You make me feel home
 You make it all better, better
 You make me feel home
 
 You're my medicine
 
 Is there a prince in this fable
 For a small town girl like me?
 The good ones are gone or not able
 And Matt Damon's not meant for me
 Damon's not meant for me
 
 I got to say
 California
 
 Is a place that I respect
 
 Come on LA, take advantage
 Give me a night that I won't forget
 
 I went to look
 From the Sky Bar to the Standard, nothing took
 These boys don't care
 Got a handful with their projects and with their looks
 
 Where are all the men in this town?
 And what's a girl supposed to do?
 Did they all run off when they knew
 That I was coming 'round, coming 'round?
 
 Where are all the men in this town?
 And what's a girl supposed to do?

 I'm so fresh, I'm so clean
 Got the lips and got the skin
 Got the skin got that thing
 I'm so fresh and I'm so
 
 Is there a prince in this fable
 For a small town girl like me?
 The good ones are gone or not able
 And Matt Damon's not meant for me
 
 I never dreamed that I'd come here to become the next Jolie
 But I sure know there's someone
 Around somewhere who's meant to be
 
 Where are all the men in this town?
 And what's a girl supposed to do?
 Did they all run off when they knew
 That I was coming round, coming round?

 So fly,
 It's a suicide, waiting, others say
 It's a suicide, waiting, yo no se
 It's a suicide, waiting, another day
 It's a suicide, waiting
 
 So decide, it's a suicide waiting, all this time
 It's a suicide, waiting, donde estas?
 It's a suicide, waiting, so I decided
 It's a suicide, waiting
 
 I think you are living in denial
 Oh can't you see she's pretty wild?
 And every night I pray that you don't knock her up
 'Cause I still want to be the mother of your child
 
 They say "l'amour est ne a Paris"
 So she's planned a little trip to France
 While she's in anxious anticipation
 I really hope you have a horrible vacation
 
 And so you think of me when you arrive
 Hope the french fleas eat you both alive
 And your room smells
 And the toilet doesn't flush
 And locals treat you mean
 And the service takes too long
 
 'Cause I'm fragile and you broke my heart in two
 But you just smile
 Like it's all the same to you, to you
 
 But when you learn your lesson
 Come back like a prodigal son
 Read the big sign at the airport
 Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
 
 And when you learn your lesson
 Come back like a prodigal son
 Read the big sign at the airport
 Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
 
 Where did you get the ability?
 To make fakes promises to me
 You are exactly like
 A politician
 Need everyone's approval just to see if you are doing right
 
 And I hope you both freeze under the Eiffel Tower
 So you end up throwing in the towel
 
 Hope you'll miss me
 And someday you're gonna see
 That I put my trust in you
 But you turned it back to me
 
 'Cause I'm fragile and you broke my heart in two
 But you just smile
 Like it's all the same to you, to you
 
 But when you learn your lesson
 Come back like a prodigal son
 Read the big sign at the airport
 Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
 
 When you learn your lesson
 Come back like a prodigal son
 Read the big sign at the airport
 Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
 
 What's your destination?
 What's your destination?
 
 When you learn your lesson
 Come back like a prodigal son
 Read the big sign at the airport
 Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
 
 But when you learn your lesson
 Come back like a prodigal son
 Read the big sign at the airport
 Bienvenue from hell, mon amour
 
 Mon amour 
 Mon amour

 Mis d'as sin ti son tan oscuros
 Tan largos tan grises
 Mis d'as sin ti
 
 Mis d'as sin ti son
 Tan absurdos
 Tan agrios tan duros
 Mis d'as sin ti
 
 Mis d'as sin ti
 No tienen noches
 Si alguna aparece es in'til
 Dormir
 
 Mis d'as sin ti son un derroche
 Las horas no tienen principio ni fin
 
 Tan faltos de aire
 Tan llenos de nada
 Chatarra inservible
 Basura en el suelo
 Moscas en la casa
 
 Mis d'as sin ti son como un cielo
 Sin lunas plateadas
 Ni rastros de sol
 
 Mis d'as sin ti son solo un eco
 Que siempre repite la misma canci'n
 
 Tan faltos de aire
 Tan llenos de nada
 Chatarra inservible
 Basura en el suelo
 Moscas en la casa
 
 Pateando las piedras
 A'n sigo esperando que vuelvas conmigo
 A'n sigo buscando
 En las caras de ancianos
 Pedazos de ni'o
 
 Cazando motivos que me hagan creer
 Que a'n me encuentro con vida,
 Mordiendo mis u'as
 Ahog'ndome en llanto
 Extra'ndote tanto
 
 Mis d'as sin ti
 Mis d'as sin ti
 Mis d'as sin ti
 Como duelen los d'as sin ti
 Sin ti
 Sin ti
 
 my days without you are so dark,
 so long, so gray
 my days without you
 my days without so are so absurd,
 so bitter, so hard
 my days without you
 my days without you don't have nights
 if some appear, it's useless to sleep
 my days without you are a waste
 the hours don't have start, nor end
 
 so lacking of air
 so filled with nothing
 useless junk
 trash on the ground
 flies in the house
 
 my days without you are like a sky
 without silver moons
 nor traces of sun
 my days without you are only an echo
 that always repeat
 the same song
 
 so lacking of air
 so filled with nothing
 useless junk
 trash on the ground
 flies in the house
 
 kicking the stones
 I even continue thinking that you will return to me
 I even continue looking the faces of elderly
 pieces of children
 hunting motives that make me believe
 that I even find myself alive
 biting my nails
 drowning in tears
 missing you so much
 
 my days without you
 my days without you
 my days without you,
 how they hurt, the days without you
 without you
 without you...
 
 Voy caminando sobre un mar de hojas secas
 Vuelan los 'ngeles sobre Berl'n
 Van entonando junto a m' un aleluya
 Mientras la lluvia cae dentro de m'
 
 Extra'o tu voz
 Estoy en tierra de nadie
 Me falta hasta el aire
 De espaldas al sol
 Pasa otro d'a sin ti
 
 No sirve de nada llegar a'n m's lejos
 Ni toda la fama, ni todo el dinero
 No sirve de nada si no est's conmigo
 Y la soledad se me clava en los huesos
 No sirve de na, ah, ah, nada
 Ah, ah, ah, nada
 Oh oh, nada, no oh
 Nada
 No, no, no, no
 
 Nadie adivina que depara el destino
 Nuestro camino a'n esta a medio hacer
 Tiro mi bolso Chanel del barrio chino
 Al suelo mojado y me lanzo a correr
 
 Extra'o tu voz
 Me hace falta tocarte
 Olerte, mirarte
 De espaldas al sol
 Acaba otro d'a sin ti
 
 No sirve de nada llegar a'n m's lejos
 Ni toda la fama, ni todo el dinero
 No sirve de nada si no est's conmigo
 Y la soledad se me clava en los huesos
 No sirve de na, ah, ah, nada
 Ah, ah, ah, nada
 Oh oh, nada, no oh
 
 No sirve de nada llegar a'n m's lejos
 Ni toda la fama, ni todo el dinero
 No sirve de nada si no est's conmigo
 Y la soledad se me clava en los huesos
 No sirve de na, ah, ah, nada
 Ah, ah, ah, nada
 Oh oh, nada, no oh
 Nada
 No, no, no, no
 
 Voy a dejar 
 Que mi guitarra diga todo lo que yo
 No se decir por mi
 O quiz's deba esperar
 A que el insulto del reloj
 Acabe de planear mi fin
 Duelen tanto las sonrisas
 Cuesta un mundo respirar
 Es que no tenerte aqu' ya me hace mal
 
 Me sigue rodeando
 La sombra de ti
 Y siguen rodando por ah'
 Todas las palabras que dijimos
 Y los besos que nos dimos
 Como siempre
 Hoy estoy
 Pensando en ti
 
 Debes saber
 Que hay pedazos de tu boca sin querer
 Regados por aqu'
 Y que tropiezo cada d'a sin pensar
 Con un viejo recuerdo mas
 Y alguna nueva historia gris
 Si no puedo estar contigo
 Ya no puedo estar sin ti
 Cada vez se hace mas duro ser feliz
 
 Me sigue rodeando
 La sombra de ti
 Y siguen rodando por ah'
 Todas las palabras que dijimos
 Y los besos que nos dimos
 Como siempre
 Hoy estoy
 Pensando en ti
 
 Todas las palabras que dijimos
 Y los besos que nos dimos
 Como siempre
 Hoy estoy
 Pensando en ti
 
 No, no intentes disculparte
 No juegues a insistir
 Las excusas ya exist'an antes de ti
 No, no me mires como antes
 No hables en plural
 La ret'rica es tu arma m's letal
 
 Voy a pedirte que no vuelvas m's
 Siento que me dueles todav'a aqu'
 Adentro
 Y que a tu edad sepas bien lo que es
 Romperle el coraz'n a alguien as'
 
 No se puede vivir con tanto veneno
 La esperanza que me ha dado amor
 No me la dio m's nadie
 Te juro, no miento
 No se puede vivir con tanto veneno
 No se puede dedicar al alma
 A acumular intentos
 Pesa m's la rabia que el cemento
 
 Espero que no esperes que te espere
 Despu's de mis 26
 La paciencia se me ha ido hasta los pies
 Y voy deshojando margaritas
 Y mirando sin mirar
 Para ver si as' te irritas y te vas
 
 Voy a pedirte que no vuelvas m's
 Siento que me dueles todav'a aqu'
 Adentro
 Y que a tu edad sepas bien lo que es
 Romperle el coraz'n a alguien as'
 
 No se puede vivir con tanto veneno
 La esperanza que me dio tu amor
 No me la dio m's nadie
 Te juro, no miento
 No se puede morir con tanto veneno
 No se puede dedicar al alma
 A acumular un intentos
 Pesa m's la rabia que el cemento
 
 No se puede vivir con tanto veneno
 No se puede vivir con tanto veneno
 No no
 No
 
 No, don't try to apologize
 Don't play the game of persistance
 Excuses existed before you did
 
 No, don't look at me like before, 
 Don't talk in plural
 Rhetoric is your most lethal weapon
 
 I'm going to ask you to never come back again
 I regret that you still can hurt me, here,
 Inside
 
 And that at your age you already know well
 What it's like to break someone's heart like this
 
 No, one can't live with so much venom
 The hope your love gave me
 No one else has given me
 I swear
 
 No, one can't live with so much venom
 One shouldn't devote the soul
 To collecting attempts
 Rage weighs more than cement
 
 I expect that you don't expect that I expect you
 After turning twenty-six
 Patience has sunk all the way down to my feet
 
 So here I pluck daisy petals
 While I'm looking without seeing
 To find out if you'll get irritated and leave
 I'm going to ask you not to come back ever again
 I regret that you still can hurt me, here,
 Inside
 
 And that at your age you already know well
 What it's like to break someone's heart
 like this
 
 No, one can't live with so much venom
 The hope your love gave me
 No one else has given me
 I swear
 
 No, one can't live with so much venom
 One shouldn't devote the soul
 To collecting attempts
 Rage weighs more than cement
 
 S'lo t' sabes bien quien soy
 Y por eso es tuyo m' coraz'n
 S'lo t' doblas mi raz'n
 Y por eso a donde t' quieras voy
 
 No creo que el mar alg'n d'a
 Pierda el sabor a sal
 No creo en mi todav'a
 No creo en el azar
 
 S'lo creo en tu sonrisa azul
 En tu mirada de cristal
 En los besos que me das
 Y en todo lo que digas
 
 S'lo t' sabes bien quien soy
 Y por eso es tuyo mi coraz'n
 S'lo t' doblas mi raz'n
 Y por eso a donde t' quieras voy
 Si hablo demasiado
 No dejes de lado
 Que nadie m's te amar' as'
 Como lo hago yo
 
 No creo en Venus ni en Marte
 No creo en Carlos Marx
 No creo en Jean Paul Sartre
 No creo en Brian Weiss
 
 S'lo creo en tu sonrisa azul
 En tu mirada de cristal
 En los besos que me das
 Y hablen lo que hablen
 
 S'lo t' sabes bien qui'n soy
 Y por eso es tuyo mi coraz'n
 S'lo t' doblas mi raz'n
 Y por eso a donde t' quieras voy
 Si hablo demasiado
 No dejes de lado
 Que nadie m's te amar' as'
 Como lo hago
 
 Quiero ser tu firmamento
 De tu boca una canci'n
 De tus alas siempre ser el viento
 
 Tu terr'n de sal
 Un rayo de sol
 Que a donde digas que t'
 Quieras que yo vaya voy
 Eres mi desliz, mi pa's feliz
 Mi primavera
 Mi escalera al cielo si
 Por eso sigo aqu' y camino
 Contigo a t' nunca podr'a decirte que no
 
 S'lo t' sabes bien quien soy
 Y por eso es tuyo mi coraz'n
 S'lo t' doblas mi raz'n
 Y por eso a donde t' quieras voy
 
 Tu terr'n de sal
 Un rayo de sol
 Que a donde digas que t' quieres
 Que yo vaya voy
 Eres mi desliz, mi pa's feliz
 Mi primavera
 Mi escalera al cielo
 
 Si hablo demasiado
 No dejes de lado
 Que nadie m's te amar' as'
 Como lo hago
 
 Only you know really who I am
 And that is why you are my only man
 Only you make my heart beat fast
 And that is why we're gonna make it last
 
 I don't believe that the sea
 Will one day taste so sweet
 I don't believe in what I feel
 I don't believe in fate
 
 I only belive in your sunny smile
 In your eyes shining like the stars
 And your kisses made of sun
 And I don't care what they say
 
 Coz only you know really who I am...
 
 If I don't stop talking
 Don't you stop believing
 That no one else will love you
 The very way that I do
 
 I don't believe in Venus and in Mars
 I don't believe in Karl Marx
 I don't believe Jean-Paul Sartre
 I don't believe in Brian Weiss.
 
 I only believe in your sunny smile
 In your eyes shining like the stars
 And your kisses made of sun
 And no matter what they say.
 
 Coz only you know really who I am...
 
 If I don't stop talking'
 
 I want to be the sky above you
 In your mouth a song
 Under your wings I'll always be the wind
 
 A piece of salt
 A ray of sunlight
 Wherever you tell me you want me to go, I will go
 My felicity, my happy country
 You are my spring, you're my stairway to heaven, yeah
 That is why I am still here walking with you,
 The only thing I can't say to you is,
 Ooh uh, whoa whoa, oh oh oh oh oh'
 
 Only you know really who I am'
 
 A piece of salt...
 
 Me temo que si
 Se trata de ti
 Voy a repetir
 El mismo error de ayer
 Y como es natural
 Suele suceder
 Y no hay ciego peor
 Que el que no quiere ver
 
 Estoy aqu' vencida
 Casi convencida que intentarlo es in'til
 Y digo yo, qu' pasa conmigo
 Mi peor castigo es que aun me vayas
 Sabes, sabes que voy yo
 
 Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
 Nunca me acuerdo de olvidarte
 Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
 Nunca aprend' como dejarte ir
 Mi mundo gira as', alrededor de ti
 Solo me acuerdo de una parte
 Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
 Y no me acuerdo de olvidarte
 Y no me acuerdo de olvidarte
 
 Salto del tren
 Caigo en tu red
 Y vuelvo a pisar la piedra que pis'
 Y mi coraz'n, se vuelve a partir
 Y no hay sordo peor
 Que el que no quiere o'r
 
 Estoy aqu' vencida
 Y casi convencida que no hay nadie mas idiota
 As' que yo muero por tu boca en la boca m'a
 Y lo intento todo todo todo todo y no
 
 Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
 Nunca me acuerdo de olvidarte
 Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
 Nunca aprend' como dejarte ir
 Mi mundo gira as', alrededor de ti
 Solo me acuerdo de una parte
 Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
 Y no me acuerdo de olvidarte
 
 Podr'a mentir
 Matar o morir
 Incluso algo mucho peor
 Forzar el destino, perder el camino
 Con tal de no perder tu amor
 Y todos me dicen que no desperdicie
 Que el tiempo les da la raz'n
 Ya llegar' el d'a
 Que habr' otro en mi vida
 Que me quiera mas y mejor
 
 Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
 Nunca me acuerdo de olvidarte
 Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
 Nunca aprend' como dejarte ir
 Mi mundo gira as', alrededor de ti
 Solo me acuerdo de una parte
 Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
 Y no me acuerdo de olvidarte
 
 Mi mundo gira as', alrededor de ti
 Solo me acuerdo de una parte
 Oh ooh oh, oh ooh oh
 Y no me acuerdo de olvidarte
 
 It's not her fault she's so irresistible
 But all the damage she's caused isn't fixable
 Every twenty seconds you repeat her name
 But when it comes to me you don't care
 If I'm alive or dead
 
 So objection I don't want to be the exception
 To get a bit of your attention
 I love you for free and I'm not your mother
 But you don't even bother
 
 Objection I'm tired of this triangle
 Got dizzy dancing tango
 I'm falling apart in your hands again
 No way I've got to get away
 
 Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal
 That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible
 But you gotta know small things also count
 You better put your feet on the ground
 And see what its about
 
 Objection I don't want to be the exception
 To get a bit of your attention
 I love you for free and I'm not your mother
 But you don't even bother
 
 Objection I'm tired of this triangle
 Got dizzy dancing tango
 I'm falling apart in your hands again
 No way I've got to get away
 
 I wish there was a chance for you and me
 I wish you couldn't find a place to be
 Away from here
 
 This is pathetic and sardonic
 Its sadistic and psychotic
 Tango is not for three
 Was never meant to be
 
 But you can try it
 Rehearse it
 Or train like a horse
 But don't you count on me
 Don't you count on me boy
 
 Objection I don't want to be the exception
 To get a bit of your attention
 I love you for free and I'm not your mother
 But you don't even bother
 
 Objection I'm tired of this triangle
 Got dizzy dancing tango
 I'm falling apart in your hands again
 No way I've got to get away
 
 get away
 get away
 eh, eh, eh get away
 I'm falling apart in your hands again
 get away
 I'm falling apart in your hands again
 get away
 
 Ay, ay como muero por ti
 C'mo poder olvidarte
 Basta que me enamores
 O que me mandes flores
 Para obtener un s'
 
 Ya tengo ojeras de tanto mirarte
 Y lo peor es que a'n me quedan tantas ganas de
 Esperarte
 Hasta que entiendas que
 
 Te quiero porque eres claro
 Claro, claro
 Como la planta de mis pies
 Como el amor despu's de hecho
 Como tu voz y tu piel
 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay
 Ay como muero por ti
 Como poder olvidarme
 Basta que mandes flores
 Para que me enamores
 Para obtener un si
 
 Te quiero porque eres claro
 Claro, claro
 Como la planta de mis pies

 El octavo d'a Dios despu's de tanto trabajar
 Para liberar tensiones luego ya de revisar
 Dijo todo esta muy bien es hora de descansar
 Y se fue a dar un paseo por el espacio sideral
 
 Quien se iba a imaginar que el mismo Dios al regresar
 Iba a encontrarlo todo en un desorden infernal
 Que se iba a convertir en un desempleado mas
 De la tasa que anualmente esta creciendo sin parar
 
 Desde ese entonces hay quienes lo han visto
 Solo en las calles transitar
 Anda esperando paciente por alguien
 Con quien al menos tranquilo
 Pueda conversar
 
 Mientras tanto este mundo gira y gira sin poderlo detener
 Y aqu' abajo unos cuantos nos manejan
 Como fichas de ajedrez
 No soy la clase de idiota
 Que se deja convencer
 Pero digo la verdad
 Y hasta un ciego lo puede ver
 
 Si a falta de ocupaci'n
 O de excesiva soledad
 Dios no resistiera mas
 Y se marchara a otro lugar
 Seria nuestra perdici'n
 No habr'a otro remedio mas
 Que adorar a Michael Jackson
 A Bill Clinton o a Tarzan
 
 Es mas dificil ser rey sin corona
 Que una persona mas normal
 Pobre de Dios que no sale en revistas
 Que no es modelo ni artista o de familia real
 
 Mientras tanto este mundo gira y gira
 Sin poderlo detener
 Y aqui abajo unos cuantos nos manejan
 Como fichas de ajedrez
 No soy la clase de idiota
 Que se deja convencer
 Pero digo la verdad
 Y hasta un ciego lo puede ver
 
 Mientras tanto este mundo gira y gira
 Sin poderlo detener
 Y aqui abajo unos cuantos nos manejan
 Como fichas de ajedrez
 No soy la clase de idiota

 Ayer conoc' un cielo sin sol
 Y un hombre sin suelo
 Un santo en prisi'n
 Y una canci'n triste sin due'o
 
 Ya he ya he ya la he
 Y conoc' tus ojos negros
 Ya he ya he ya la he
 Y ahora si que no
 Puedo vivir sin ellos yo
 
 Le pido al cielo solo un deseo
 Que en tus ojos yo pueda vivir
 He recorrido ya el mundo entero
 Y una cosa te vengo a decir
 Viaje de Bahrein hasta Beirut
 Fui desde el Norte hasta el polo sur
 Y no encontr' ojos as'
 Como los que tienes t'

 Como los que tienes t'
 
 Ayer vi pasar una mujer
 Debajo de su camello
 Un rio de sal un barco
 Abandonado en el desierto
 
 Ya he ya he ya la he
 Y vi pasar tus ojos negros
 Ya he ya he ya la he
 Y ahora si que no
 Puedo vivir sin ellos yo
 
 Le pido al cielo solo un deseo
 Que en tus ojos yo pueda vivir
 He recorrido ya el mundo entero

 Contigo yo pierdo hasta mis bueno modales
 Y que terminemos como los animales
 
 Mu'vete, mu'vete como un invertebrado
 Yo soy tu cazadora y t' eres mi venado

 Eso que me dices t' eso
 Son palabras bonitas dedicadas
 llenas de amor para mi
 T' eres mi Goldita
 
 Eso que me dices t' eso

 llenas de amor para mi
 
 Oye, oye, perversi'n absoluta en el mar
 y perverso como tener sexo en una funeraria
 Yo soy el jefe y yo la secretaria
 deja que te saque tu lado de ordinaria
 Shaki, t' est's bien bonita
 aunque tambi'n me gustabas
 cuando estabas m's gordita
 con el pelito negrito
 y la cara redondita
 as' medio rockerita
 Tambi'n me gustas ahora
 pero cuando pierdeslos modales
 cuando comes sin cubiertos
 
 Cuando se te sale lo sucio, lo obsceno
 todo lo que sabe es bueno
 todo el veneno
 Si yo soy criminal, t' eres una delincuente
 Vamos a tirarnos los dos del mismo puente
 Sin paraca'das, en nuestro mundo, volando
 Como los hippies cuando est'n fumando
 
 Eso, que me dices t' eso
 Son palabras bonitas dedicadas
 Llenas de amor para mi
 Oye, oye t' eres mi gordita
 Eso, que me dices t' eso
 Son palabras bonitas dedicadas

 Ese que me mira es un delincuente
 Soy caperucita, t' eres el lobo que miente
 Ay'dame a pasarme para el lado salvaje
 Aunque yo no tenga que llevar maquillaje
 
 Tu cuerpecito es todo, todo lo que pienso
 Soy peor que t', si me buscas yo te encuentro
 Chiquita rica que me pica
 Cuando pica chica
 
 Chico dame un pico rico
 En el hocico rico
 
 Yo poco a poco
 Poco a poco
 Te toco un poco
 Tara, tara, tara, tara
 Chiquita rica que me pica
 Cuando pica chica
 
 Chico dame un pico rico
 En el hocico rico

 Me encanta tumbarme al sol
 pelo suelto y bronceador
 con mi walkman amarillo
 toalla, arena en mi o'do
 cuando pasas que se yo
 siento conmocion que no
 dedicabas tu sonrisa
 yo me hago la distra'da
 delatando al corazon
 y me pongo mis jeans
 y corro, corro
 no me sigas no, no, no
 No se como 
 en tus ojos
 de arenas movedizas
 siento todo
 y aqui en la cuerda floja
 estoy que horror
 No se como se puede ser tan bello
 tan divertido un trueno
 en mi cielo
 y miedo siento
 que esto es tu amor
 peligro, peligro.
 Me encanta mi colecci'n
 las revistas
 y los chistes que no explican
 que distraen mi atenci'n
 por favor ya basta
 stop, stop, stop, stop.
 Si cortamos es mejor
 dejame asi con mi vida
 quien dijo que en mi pelicula
 ser'as el primer actor
 y te llevo hasta en mis bolsillos
 creo que enloquecere.
 
 Aqu' est's
 Ya no puedes detenerte
 'D'nde vas?
 Si estoy loco por tenerte
 C'mo lo iba a saber
 Que te ver'a otra vez
 
 T' me confundes, no s' qu' hacer
 Yo lo que quiero es pasarla bien
 Yo tengo miedo de que me guste
 Y que vaya a enloquecer
 Si eso pasa yo seguir'
 Contigo aqu' como un perro fiel
 Yo tengo miedo de que me guste
 Y que vaya a enloquecer
 
 Te hablo en serio mai, no estoy jugando
 Tanto tiempo pasa y nada
 Estas ganas no me aguanto
 Y aunque t' me esquives, yo te sigo deseando
 Dicen que t' eres peligrosa
 No le hago caso a esas cosas
 Dime qu' est' pasando
 Me tienes como un loco, soy un loco enamorado, eh
 Quiero saber cu'nto me vas a insistir
 Y hasta d'nde llegar'as por m'
 Siento mucho la espera
 Pero valdr' la pena cuando te est' besando
 De la manera que te mueves as'
 Yo te lo juro me voy a derretir
 T' sabes que soy buena
 Por m's que yo te esquive me sigues deseando
 
 T' me confundes, no s' qu' hacer
 Yo lo que quiero es pasarla bien
 Yo tengo miedo de que me guste
 Y que vaya a enloquecer
 Si eso pasa yo seguir'
 Contigo aqu' como un perro fiel
 Yo tengo miedo de que me guste
 Y que vaya a enloquecer
 
 Enloque-que-quecer
 Yo no pido nada extraordinario
 Solo un hombre de verdad
 Que se tire por m' al barro
 Que cambie las bombillas o hasta que me lave el carro
 Quiero un tipo atento y cari'oso
 Pero que no sea muy celoso
 Que en la calle sea un pr'ncipe
 Pero que en mi cama sea salvaje y peligroso
 
 Puedes pedir lo que quieras de m'
 Yo har'a lo que fuera para ti
 Siento mucho la espera
 Pero valdr' la pena cuando te est' besando
 Yo estoy seguro que estoy hecho pa' ti
 Yo te lo juro no te har' sufrir
 Como te dije nena
 Por m's que t' me esquives, te sigo deseando
 
 T' me confundes, no s' qu' hacer
 Yo lo que quiero es pasarla bien
 Yo tengo miedo de que me guste
 Y que vaya a enloquecer
 Si eso pasa yo seguir'
 Contigo aqu' como un perro fiel
 Yo tengo miedo de que me guste
 Y que vaya a enloquecer
 
 Enloque-que-quecer
 Aqu' est's
 Ya no puedes detenerte
 'D'nde vas? 
 Si estoy loco por tenerte
 
 Voc' pertence a uma ra'a antiga
 De p's descal'os
 E de sonhos brancos
 Foi poeira e ' poeira volta
 O ferro exposto ao calor ' brando
 
 Voc' mordeu a ma'
 E renunciou ao para'so
 E condenou a tal serpente
 Sendo voc' que o quis
 
 Por mil'nios e mil'nios
 Vem correndo pelo mundo
 Enfrentando dinossauros
 Sem um teto e sem escudo
 
 E agora est' aqui
 Querendo ser feliz
 Chorando como um menino
 O seu destino
 
 Voc' pertence a uma ra'a antiga
 De p's descal'os
 E de sonhos brancos
 Foi poeira e ' poeira volta
 O ferro exposto ao calor ' brando
 
 Construiu un mundo exacto
 Acabado e perfeito
 Cada coisa calculada
 Em seu espa'o e a seu tempo
 Eu que sou um caos completo
 Uma entrada uma sa'da
 Uma regra e uma medida
 S'o conceitos que n'o entendo
 
 E agora est' aqui
 Querendo ser feliz
 Chorando como um menino
 O seu destino

 Saudar o vizinho
 Acordar a uma hora
 Trabalhar cada dia
 Para viver a vida
 Contestar mais aquilo
 E sentir menos isto
 E que Deus nos ampare
 Desses maus pensamentos
 Cumprir com as tarefas
 Freq'entar o col'gio
 Que diria a fam'lia
 Se voc' ' um fracassado?
 Calce sempre sapatos
 Sem barulho na mesa
 Use meias palavras e
 Gravata nas festas
 As mulheres se casam
 Sempre antes dos trinta
 Se acreditam que ' pouco
 E ainda assim n'o te aceitam
 E no baile dos quinze
 N'o deixe de comprar
 Uma fina champanha
 E uma valsa dan'ar
 E uma valsa dan'ar 
 
 Prefiero toda la miel a un gramo de sal
 Prefiero un raro comienzo a un mal final
 Y si se trata de dormir prefiero despertar
 
 Prefiero el sol a una lampara de ne'n
 Prefiero mil bienvenidas a un adios
 Prefiero quedarme a escuchar entera esta canci'n
 
 Por si en una estrofa me llego a tropezar con Dios
 Y bailar sin parar, que hacerme en un rinc'n
 Y sentarme a esperar y a perder la ilusi'n
 Y si hablo sin pensar entonces es mucho mejor
 
 El mundo es una esfera gira y vuelve donde se esperar'
 Mis ojos mirar'n cosas que ni alcanzo a imaginar
 El mundo es una esfera gira y vuelve donde se esperar'
 Cuando alguien pide mas sabe que quien busca va a encontrar
 
 Prefiero un mundo a un pedazo de souvenir
 Seguir la lucha dejar de sobrevivir
 Prefiero olvidar lo que d' a lo que recib'
 
 Y aunque rompa mi coraz'n volver a amarte asi
 Y bailar sin parar como me gusta a mi
 Y sentarte a esperar no me ire de aqui
 Y si te hablo de mas, t' vive y deja vivir
 
 El mundo es una esfera gira y vuelve donde se esperar'

 Estas semanas sin verte
 Me parecieron anos
 Tanto te quise besar
 Que me duelen los labios
 
 Mira que el miedo nos hizo
 Cometer estupideces
 Nos dejo sordos y ciegos
 Tantas veces
 
 Y un d'a despu's
 De la tormenta
 Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
 De tanto sumar
 Pierdes la cuenta
 Porque uno y uno
 No siempre son dos
 Cuando menos piensas
 Sale el sol
 
 Te llore hasta el extremo
 De lo que era posible
 Cuando cre' lo que era
 Invencible
 No hay mal que dure cien anos
 Ni cuerpo que lo aguante
 Y lo mejor siempre espera
 Adelante
 
 Y un d'a despu's
 De la tormenta
 Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
 De tanto sumar
 
 Pierdes la cuenta
 Porque uno y uno
 No siempre son dos
 Cuando menos piensas
 Sale el sol
 
 Cuando menos piensas
 Sale el sol
 
 Y un d'a despu's
 De la tormenta
 Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
 De tanto sumar
 Pierdes la cuenta
 Porque uno y uno no
 Siempre son dos
 
 Y un d'a despu's
 Y un d'a despu's
 Sale el sol
 
 Y un d'a despu's
 De la tormenta
 Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
 De tanto sumar
 Pierdes la cuenta
 Porque uno y uno no siempre son dos
 
 Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
 
 Cada d'a pienso en ti
 Pienso un poco m's en ti
 Despedazo mi raz'n
 Se destruye algo de mi
 Cada d'a pienso en ti
 Pienso un poco m's en ti
 
 Cada d'a pienso en ti
 Pienso un poco m's en ti
 Cada vez que sale el sol
 Busco en algo el valor
 Para continuar as'
 
 Y te veo as' no te toque
 Rezo por ti cada noche
 Amanece y pienso en ti
 Y retumba en mis o'dos
 El tictac de los relojes
 Y sigo pensando en ti
 
 Y sigo pensando
 
 Perteneciste a una raza antigua
 De pies descalzos y de sue'os blancos
 Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
 Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es blando
 
 T' mordiste la manzana y renunciaste al para'so
 Y condenaste a una serpiente siendo t' el que as' lo quiso
 Por milenios y milenios permaneciste desnudo
 Y te enfrentaste a dinosaurios bajo un techo y sin escudo
 
 Y ahora estas aqui
 Queriendo ser feliz
 Cuando no te importo
 Un pepino tu destino
 
 Perteneciste a una raza antigua
 De pies descalzos y de sue'os blancos
 Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
 Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es blando
 
 Construiste un mundo exacto de acabados tan perfectos
 Cada cosa calculada en su espacio y a su tiempo
 Yo que soy un caos completo, las entradas, las salidas
 Los nombres y las medidas no me caben en los sesos
 
 Y ahora estas aqui
 Queriendo ser feliz
 Cuando no te importo
 Un pepino tu destino
 
 Perteneciste a una raza antigua
 De pies descalzos y de sue'os blancos
 Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
 Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es
 
 Perteneciste a una raza antigua
 De pies descalzos y de sue'os blancos
 Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
 Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es blando
 
 Saludar al vecino, acostarse a una hora
 Trabajar cada d'a para vivir en la vida
 Y contestar solo aquello y sentir solo esto
 Y que Dios nos ampare de malos pensamientos
 
 Cumplir con las tareas, asistir al colegio
 'Que dir'a la familia si eres un fracasado?
 Y ponte siempre zapatos, no hagas ruido en la mesa
 Usa medias veladas y corbata en las fiestas
 
 Las mujeres se casan siempre antes de treinta
 Si no vestirn santos y aunque as' no lo quieran
 Y en la fiesta de quince es mejor no olvidar
 Una fina champa'a y bailar bien el vals
 Y bailar bien el vals
 
 You belonged to an old race,
 Of barefoot feet and white dreams'
 You were dust, and dust you are 
 He thinks that the iron is always soft to the heat'
 
 Chorus:
 You bit the apple, and renounced the paradise
 Condemned the snake, even though you're the one who wanted it...
 
 For millenniums and millenniums 
 You remained naked
 And you faced dinosaurs under a roof, and without a shield.
 
 Now you are here'
 Wanting to be happy'
 is not a test, DJ

Traelo pa' tras, trae trealo p
 
 
 You constructed an exact world, finished it so perfectly.
 Each thing calculated in it's space'
 
 That I am a complete chaos'the entrances, the exits, the names, and the measures do not fit me.
 
 And now you are here'
 Wanting to be happy'
 When I do not concern a cucumber to your destiny'
 
 To greet the neighbor, to rest an hour, 
 To work every day, to live life'
 And a single answer to that'
 To feel single to this'
 God protects us from bad thoughts'
 
 To fulfill the tasks, and to attend the school.
 That tells the family if your failing?
 And always wear shoes,
 Don't make noise at the table,
 Use guarded averages'
 And neckties at celebrations'
 
 Women always marry before 30
 Yes, they don't dress holy'
 Even though he does not want it'
 And in his 15th celebration, he better not forget'
 Fine champagne and to dance waltz well'dance waltz well'
 
 You're too far to bring you close
 And too high to see below
 Just hangin' on your daily dose
 I know you never needed anyone
 But the rolling papers for your grass
 How can you give what you don't have
 
 You keep on aiming for the top
 And quit before you sweat a drop
 Feed your empty brain
 With your hydroponic pot
 Start out playing with yourself
 You get more fun within your shell
 Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way
 
 I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
 But you're so in love with yourself
 If I say my heart is sore
 Sounds like a cheap metaphor
 So I won't repeat it no more
 
 I rather eat my soup with a fork
 Or drive a cab in New York
 'Cause to talk to you is harder work
 
 So what's the point of wasting all my words
 If it's just the same or even worse
 Than reading poems to a horse
 
 You keep on aiming for the top
 And quit before you sweat a drop
 Feed your empty brain
 With your hydroponic pot
 I bet you'll find someone like you
 'Cause there's a foot for every shoe
 I wish you luck but I've other things to do
 
 I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
 But you're so in love with yourself
 If I say my heart is sore
 Sounds like a cheap metaphor
 So I won't repeat it no more
 
 Prefiero toda la miel a un gramo de sal

 Cuando algui'n pide m's
 sabe que quien buscas ya encontraras
 
 Prefiero un mundo a un pedazo de souvenir

 Let us be wrong and let's begin
 A mistake that turns into perfection
 I want to see you      s l i d i n g   in
 my underworld
 
 This time I plan to let you in
 I'll be a victim of my own invention
 Let us be wrong and let's begin
 Once and for all
 What heaven weaves and braids no man shall undo
 And I've been custom-made for no one but you
 you know it's now or never
 
 I have a feeling inside
 
 And intuition's always been a woman's guide
  
 
 We've been wanting each other since before we were born
 
 And I will WANT you even after I am gone
 
 This time I plan to let you in
 I'll be here in full subordination
 I'll be devoted to your will
 Once and for all
 
 Love is only pain disguised as a kiss
 So make me feel it now
 Let's get on with this
 and the sooner the better
 
 I have a feeling inside
 
 And intuition's always been a woman's guide
 
 We've been wanting each other since before we were born
 
 And I will   want  you even after I am gone
 
 I have a feeling inside
 
 And intuition's always been a woman's guide
 
 We've been wanting each other since before we were born
 
 And I will love you even after I am gone
 After I am gone...
 
 Que se arruinen los canales de noticias
 Con lo mucho que odio la televisi'n
 Que se vuelvan anticuadas las sonrisas
 Y se extingan todas las puestas de sol
 Que se supriman las doctrinas y deberes
 Que se terminen las pel'culas de acci'n
 Que se destruyan en el mundo los placeres
 Y que se escriba hoy una ultima canci'n
 
 Pero que me quedes tu
 Y me quede tu abrazo
 Y el beso que inventas cada d'a
 Y que me quede aqu'
 Despu's del ocaso
 Para siempre tu melancol'a
 Porque yo, yo si, si
 Que dependo de ti
 Y si me quedas tu
 Me queda la vida
 
 Que desaparezcan todos los vecinos
 Y se coman las sobras de mi inocencia
 Que se vayan uno a uno los amigos
 Y acribillen mi pedazo de conciencia
 Que se consuman las palabras en los labios
 Que contaminen todo el agua del planeta
 O que renuncien los filantropos y sabios
 Y que se muera hoy hasta el ultimo poeta
 
 Pero que me quedes tu
 Y me quede tu abrazo
 Y el beso que inventas cada d'a
 Y que me quede aqu'
 Despu's del ocaso
 Para siempre tu melancol'a
 Porque yo, yo si, si
 Que dependo de ti
 Y si me quedas tu
 Me queda la vida
 
 Pero que me quedes tu
 Y me quede tu abrazo
 Y el beso que inventas cada d'a
 Y que me quede aqu'
 Despu's del ocaso
 Para siempre tu melancol'a
 Porque yo, yo si, si
 Que dependo de ti
 Y si me quedas tu
 Me queda la vida
 
 Y que voy a hacer con mi despiste selectivo
 Y con mi sue'o frustrado de aprender a cocinar
 Y que voy a hacer con los Domingos
 Y feriados ning'n plan es apropiado
 Cuando intento no pensar
 
 Dime acaso a d'nde vas
 Ahora que no estoy
 Dime acaso a d'nde voy
 Ahora que no estas
 
 Que me inventare para decirle al mundo
 Entero si me ven tumbada al suelo
 Y sin mas ganas de volar
 C'mo escondo este par de alas rotas
 Y las suelas de mis botas cansadas
 De caminar
 
 Dime acaso a d'nde vas
 Ahora que no estoy
 Dime acaso a d'nde voy
 Ahora que no estas
 
 Yo quiero que vuelvas
 Que te est'n reclamando
 Mis labios que hace tiempo no besas
 Yo quiero que regreses
 Ya ves que hasta mis manos
 De tanto no tocarte me duelen me duelen
 
 Y que voy a hacer si mi barbilla llega al piso
 Y aunque intente la sonrisa no me sale natural
 Si ya me han visto con la mirada perdida
 Unas cuantas libras menos
 Y unas lagrimas de mas
 
 Dime acaso a d'nde vas
 Ahora que no estoy
 Dime acaso a d'nde voy
 Ahora que no estas
 
 Yo quiero que vuelvas
 Que te est'n reclamando
 Mis labios que hace tiempo no besas
 Yo quiero que regreses
 Ya ves que hasta mis manos
 De tanto no tocarte me duelen
 Yo quiero que vuelvas
 Que te est'n reclamando
 Mis labios que hace tiempo no besas
 Yo quiero que regreses
 Si sabias que eras para mi
 Y siempre quisiste estar aqu'
 Aun no entiendo como, cuando, donde,
 Ni porque te perd', yo no se vivir as'
 
 Yo quiero que vuelvas
 Yo quiero que regreses
 Yo quiero que vuelvas
 Que te est'n reclamando
 Mis labios que hace tiempo no besas
 Yo quiero que regreses
 Ya ves que hasta mis manos
 De tanto no tocarte me duelen me duelen
 
 Que me gaste yo la vida devorando
 Cada pensamiento tuyo, cada paso
 Que se borren tus lunares y aparezcan en remplazo
 Dibujados en tu cuerpo cada beso, cada abrazo
 
 Y ahora que est's aqu'
 Yo de nuevo soy feliz
 Pude entender que eras para mi
 
 D'jame quererte tanto, que te seques con mi llanto
 Que se nuble cada cielo y que llueva hasta hacer charcos
 D'jame besarte tanto, hasta que quedes sin aliento
 Y abrazarte con tal fuerza que te parta hasta los huesos
 
 Y ahora que est's aqu'
 Yo de nuevo soy feliz
 Pude entender que eras para mi
 
 Quiero excederme, perseguirte, pretenderte
 Quiero amarte noche y d'a
 Quiero gastarme la vida
 Quiero amarrarte a mis 60 de cintura
 Llevarte como un tatuaje
 Quiero perder la cordura
 
 Este nuevo amanecer
 es abrir la puerta de mis a'os
 sin saber por que
 esta vida nunca pasa en vano
 siempre hay un despues
 y vivir en este mundo
 es algo muy dificil de ejercer.
 Busco eternas primaveras
 que renazcan a la vida
 huracan de emociones
 me confunden, me dominan.
 Mi vida es transparente todavia
 la flor que se abre a plena luz del dia
 mi primer amor
 lo siento tan directo al corazon.
 Hoy descubro que es amar
 un abrazo, una caricia plena
 algo mas que dar
 es el sueno que ahora me libera
 mi otra verdad
 en mis quince soy mujer en realidad.
 Busco eternas primaveras
 que renazcan a la vida
 huracan de emociones
 me confunden, me motivan.
 Mi vida es transparente todavia
 la flor que se abre a plena luz del dia
 mi primer amor
 lo siento tan directo al corazon.

 I don't want to clear the cobwebs from my head
 Time will bring them back I bet
 So, if you hear me say that I believe in love
 Don't make me feel ashamed
 I used to sing the saddest songs
 And while in the meantime roaches used to climb my door
 Falling back down to the floor
 I used to read survival guides
 When my world was full of seven-legged cats
 But here I am with eight more lives
 
 I'm ready for the good times
 I'm ready for the good times
 Ready to get it on
 
 I'm ready for the good times
 I'm ready for the good times
 Now that I'm not alone
 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 You know it
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 You better not
 Ignore it
 
 I don't want to look at fashion magazines
 While someone does my nails
 Sitting here, watching other people live
 Frozen by the fear to fail
 'Cause everyday there's a war to fight
 And if I win or lose, never mind
 As long as you're my shelter every night
 I used to cry against a wall
 But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
 Swear to me you won't be gone
 
 I'm ready for the good times
 I'm ready for the good times
 Ready to get it on
 
 I'm ready for the good times
 I'm ready for the good times
 Now that I'm not alone
 
 'Cause everyday there's a war to fight
 And if I win or lose, never mind
 As long as you're my shelter every night
 I used to cry against a wall
 But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
 Swear to me you won't be gone
 
 I'm ready for the good times
 I'm ready for the good times
 Ready to get it on
 
 I'm ready for the good times
 I'm ready for the good times
 Now that I'm not alone
 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 You know it
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
 You better not
 Ignore it
 
 You have to swear
 You've got love to love me
 That will last forever
 We must have a story
 With a happy ending
 I swear to never go away?
 And never put aside
 The things I'm gonna say
 'Cause these are rules for us
 
 Use your eyes only to look at me
 Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
 We are branches of the same old tree
 You can laugh only if you laugh with me
 You can cry only if you cry for me
 Don't forget that you're condemned to me
 Can't you see
 You always were
 You'll always be
 
 You used to say
 I should see a doctor
 Who would keep me busy
 'Cause a jealous woman
 Never makes it easy
 And I finally know what to do for us
 Whatever seems right
 But it may take a while
 Before I change the rules
 
 Use your eyes only to look at me
 Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
 We are branches of the same old tree
 You can laugh only if you laugh with me
 You can cry only if you cry for me
 Don't forget that you're condemned to me
 Can't you see
 You always were
 You always were
 
 Use your eyes only to look at me
 Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
 We are branches of the same old tree
 You can laugh only if you laugh with me
 You can cry only if you cry for me
 Don't forget that you're condemned to me
 Can't you see
 You always were
 You'll always be
 
 Estas semanas sin verte
 Me parecieron anos
 Tanto te quise besar
 Que me duelen los labios
 
 Mira que el miedo nos hizo
 Cometer estupideces
 Nos dejo sordos y ciegos
 Tantas veces
 
 Y un d'a despu's
 De la tormenta
 Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
 De tanto sumar
 Pierdes la cuenta
 Porque uno y uno
 No siempre son dos
 Cuando menos piensas
 Sale el sol
 
 Te llore hasta el extremo
 De lo que era posible
 Cuando cre' lo que era
 Invencible
 No hay mal que dure cien anos
 Ni cuerpo que lo aguante
 Y lo mejor siempre espera
 Adelante
 
 Y un d'a despu's
 De la tormenta
 Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
 De tanto sumar
 
 Pierdes la cuenta
 Porque uno y uno
 No siempre son dos
 Cuando menos piensas
 Sale el sol
 
 Cuando menos piensas
 Sale el sol
 
 Y un d'a despu's
 De la tormenta
 Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
 De tanto sumar
 Pierdes la cuenta
 Porque uno y uno no
 Siempre son dos
 
 Y un d'a despu's
 Y un d'a despu's
 Sale el sol
 
 Y un d'a despu's
 De la tormenta
 Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
 De tanto sumar
 Pierdes la cuenta
 Porque uno y uno no siempre son dos
 
 Cuando menos piensas sale el sol
 
 Braulio tiene ojos grandes y cabellos oscuros
 Nunca come en exceso y jam's duerme desnudo
 Siempre viste de gris, pues no tiene remedio
 La tendencia a buscarse siempre el punto intermedio
 
 Dana es ni'a de bien 
 Nunca llega a su casa a m's de diez ni muy tarde
 Braulio y Dana se quieren como cualquier pareja
 Pero un d'a fueron presa de la naturaleza
 Y de sus propios instintos
 No escaparon con suerte
 Con el fuego por dentro
 Y las hormonas presentes
 Por la ley del magneto
 Se acercaron los cuerpos
 
 Pero si a la hora del t'
 Nada pasa
 S'lo te ir's lejos de casa
 Por haber tra'do un habitante m's
 A ingresar a esta podrida ciudad
 Donde lo que no se quiere se mata
 
 Ese d'a llegaste un poco m's de las diez
 Pero el susto se dio unas semanas despu's
 Cuando te confirmaron tus terribles sospechas
 Un ni'o nacer'a y ya sab'as la fecha
 
 Y antes de que el vecino y la familia supieran
 Fuiste donde el doctor a acabar con el problema
 Hoy tu vecino esta en casa d'ndose un buen duchazo
 Y tu dos metros bajo tierra viendo crecer gusanos
 
 Pero si a la hora del t'
 Nada pasa
 S'lo te ir's lejos de casa
 Por haber tra'do un habitante m's
 A ingresar a esta podrida ciudad
 Donde lo que no se quiere se mata
 
 Pero si a la hora del t'
 Nada pasa
 S'lo te ir's lejos de casa
 Por haber tra'do un habitante m's
 A ingresar a est' podrida ciudad
 Donde lo que no se quiere se mata
 
 Yeah! Wyclef y Shakira
 No Fighting, No Fighting
 Shakira, Shakira 
 
 Yo no sabia que ella bailaba as'
 Aquella noche yo enloquec' 
 Como se llama, bonita, mi casa su casa  
 
 Tu sabes que palabras hay,
 Para hacerme suspirar
 Mantente atento,
 Ya va llegando el momento 
 
 Ser', ser' que lo que un d'a fue
 Es porque fue para hacerse hoy
 Tu sientes, te siento, mira as' baby as' es perfecto. 
 
 Amor yo no me canso de verte y me estas enloqueciendo
 En fin, pronto yo quiero tenerte, y que sientas lo que siento
 Cuando te veo caminar, no me puedo controlar 
 Tu te mueves como el viento
 Solo quisiera imaginar ser el due'o de tu coraz'n y detener el tiempo 
 
 Yo no sabia que ella bailaba as'
 Aquella noche yo enloquec' 
 Como se llama, bonita, mi casa su casa 
 
 Tu sabes que palabras hay,
 Para hacerme suspirar
 Mantente atento,
 Ya va llegando el momento 
 
 Ser', ser' que lo que un d'a fue
 es porque fue para hacerse hoy
 tu sientes, te siento, as' baby as' es perfecto 
 
 Hay, lo que ser', ser' y lo que aun no fue
 es porque fue para que sea ya, me gustas, te encuentro
 mira as' baby as' es perfecto. 
 
 Amor ahora que empiezas a verme
 de esa forma animal
 ya no, se lo que piensas hacerme
 Si esta bien o esta mal
 Mi voluntad se hecho a perder
 No hay ciego peor que el que no quiere ver
 Si lo que hago con las manos lo deshago con los pies
 lo que hay es lo que ves 
 
 Baila en la calle de noche
 Baila en la calle de d'a. 
 
 Baila en la calle de noche
 Baila en la calle de d'a. 
 
 Yo no sabia que ella bailaba as'
 Aquella noche yo enloquec' 
 Como se llama, bonita, mi casa su casa 
 
 Tu sabes que palabras hay,
 Para hacerme suspirar
 Mantente atento,
 Ya va llegando el momento 
 
 Se'orita feel the conga
 Mueve tu cintura como toda Colombia 
 
 Mira en Barranquilla se baila as', say it!
 Mira en Barranquilla se baila as' 
 
 Yeah
 She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country
 I go back like when 'pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
 I need a whole club dizzy
 Why the CIA wanna watch us?
 Colombians and Haitians
 I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
 Boo-boop-so-boop
 No more do we snatch ropes
 Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats 
 
 Ser', ser' que lo que un d'a fue
 es porque fue para hacerse hoy
 tu sientes, te siento, mira as' baby as' es perfecto 
 
 Hay, lo que ser', ser' y lo que aun no fue
 es porque fue para que sea ya, me gustas, te encuentro
 mira as' baby as' es perfecto. 
 
 No, no intentes disculparte, no juegues a insistir
 Las escusas ya exist? An antes de ti
 No, no me mires como antes, no hables en plural
 La plet? Rica es tu arma m? S letal
 
 Voy a pedirte que no vuelvas mas
 Siento que me dueles todav? A aqu?
 Y que a tu edad sepas bien lo que es
 Romperle el coraz? N a alguien as?
 
 No se puede vivir con tanto veneno
 La esperanza que me ha dado amor
 No me la dio mas nadie
 Te juro, no miento
 No se puede vivir con tanto veneno
 No se puede dedicar al alma
 Como un gran intento
 Pesa mas la rabia que el cemento
 
 Espero que me esperes que te espere despu? S de lo veintis? Is
 La pasi? N ya se me ha ido hasta los pies
 Voy desojando margaritas y mirando sin mirar
 Para ver si as? Te irritas y te vas
 
 Voy a pedirte que no vuelvas mas
 Siento que me dueles todav? A aqu? Adentro
 Y que a tu edad sepas bien lo que es
 Romperle el coraz? N a alguien as?
 
 No se puede vivir con tanto veneno
 La esperanza que me ha dado amor
 No me la dio mas nadie
 Te juro, no miento
 No se puede morir con tanto veneno
 No se puede dedicar al alma
 Como un gran intento
 Pesa mas la rabia que el cemento
 
 No se puede vivir con tanto veneno...
 No se puede vivir con tanto veneno...
 No... No...
 
 S-O-S she is in disguise
 S-O-S she is in disguise
 There's a she wolf in disguise,
 Coming out, coming out, coming out
 
 A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me,
 Darling it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
 Moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
 My body is craving, so feed the hungry
 
 I've been devoting myself to you
 Monday to Monday
 And Friday to Friday
 Not getting enough retribution
 Or decent incentives to keep me at it
 Starting to feel just a little abused
 Like a coffee machine in an office 
 So I'm gonna go somewhere closer
 To get me a lover and tell you about it
 
 There's a she wolf in the closet,
 Open up and set her free 
 There's a she wolf in the closet,
 Let it out so it can breath
 
 Sitting across the bar, staring right at her prey,
 It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
 Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent,
 The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student
 
 To locate the single man
 I've got on me a special radar,
 And the fire department's hot line
 in case I get in trouble later
 Not looking for cute little divas
 Or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
 I'm having a very good time
 and behave very bad in the arms of a boy
 
 There's a she wolf in the closet
 Open up and set her free 
 There's a she wolf in the closet
 Let it out so it can breath
 
 S-O-S she is in disguise
 S-O-S she is in disguise
 There's a she wolf in disguise
 Coming out, coming out, coming out
 
 S-O-S she is in disguise
 S-O-S she is in disguise
 There's a she wolf in disguise
 Coming out, coming out, coming out
 
 There's a she wolf in the closet
 Let it out so it can breath
 
 Cu'ntame que har's despu's que estrenes su cuerpo
 Cuando muera tu traviesa curiosidad
 Cuando memorices todos sus recovecos
 Y decidas otra vez regresar
 Ya no estar' aqu' en el mismo lugar
 
 Si no tiene m's que un par de dedos de frente
 Y descubres que no se lava bien los dientes
 Si te quita los pocos centavos que tienes
 Y luego te deja solo tal como quiere
 
 Se que volver's el d'a
 En que ella te haga trizas
 Sin almohadas para llorar
 Pero si est's decidido
 Y no quieres mas conmigo
 Nada ahora puede importar
 Por que sin ti el mundo ya me da igual
 
 Si te vas si te vas si te marchas
 Mi cielo se har' gris
 Si te vas si te vas ya no tienes
 Que venir por mi
 Si te vas si te vas y me cambias
 Por esa bruja pedazo de cuero
 No vuelvas nunca mas, ya no estar' aqu'
 
 Toda escoba nueva siempre barre bien
 Luego vas a ver desgastadas las cerdas
 Cuando las arrugas le corten la piel
 Y la celulitis invada sus piernas
 
 Volver's desde tu infierno
 Con el rabo entre los cuernos
 Implorando una vez mas
 Pero para ese entonces
 Yo estar' un mill'n de noches
 Lejos de esta enorme ciudad
 Lejos de ti el mundo ya me da igual
 
 Si te vas si te vas si te marchas
 Mi cielo se har' gris
 Si te vas si te vas ya no tienes
 Que venir por mi
 Si te vas si te vas y me cambias
 Por esa bruja pedazo de cuero
 No vuelvas nunca mas, ya no estar' aqu'
 
 Si te vas si te vas si te marchas
 Mi cielo se har' gris
 Si te vas si te vas ya no tienes
 Que venir por mi
 Si te vas si te vas y me cambias
 Por es bruja pedazo de cuero
 No vuelvas nunca mas
 No vuelvas no estar' aqu'
 
 Tell me what you'll do after the first time you try out her body
 When your mischievous curiosity dies
 When you memorize all her nooks and crannies
 And decide to come back
 I won't be here in the same place
 
 If only has a few inches worth of forehead
 And you find out she doesn't brush her teeth very well
 And she rids you of the few cents that you've got
 And later leaves you by your lonesome as she wishes
 
 I know you'll be back the day 
 that she tears you into pieces leaving you without pillows to cry on
 But if you've decided you want nothing more to do with me
 Nothing else can really matter
 Because without you
 The world's still the same to me
 
 If you leave, if you leave, if you march off
 my sky will turn to grey
 If you leave, if you leave, if you march off
 You don't have to come just for my sake
 If you leave, if you leave, if you march off
 and you trade me for that witch, you piece of crap
 don't ever come back because I won't be here
 
 Every new broom sweeps well at first
 But later on the bristles get bent
 When the wrinkles impede upon her skin
 and the cellulite starts to invade her legs
 
 You'll emerge from your personal hell
 with your tail between your horns
 begging once again
 but for that very reason
 I'll be a million nights away from this enormous city
 Far away from you
 And the world is just the same to me
 
 If you leave, if you leave, if you march off
 my sky will turn to grey
 If you leave, if you leave, if you march off
 You don't have to come just for my sake
 If you leave, if you leave, if you march off
 and you trade me for that witch, you piece of crap
 don't ever come back because I won't be here
 
 Voy a dejar 
 Que mi guitarra diga todo lo que yo
 No se decir por mi
 O quiz's deba esperar
 A que el insulto del reloj
 Acabe de planear mi fin
 Duelen tanto las sonrisas
 Cuesta un mundo respirar
 Es que no tenerte aqu' ya me hace mal
 
 Me sigue rodeando
 La sombra de ti
 Y siguen rodando por ah'
 Todas las palabras que dijimos
 Y los besos que nos dimos
 Como siempre
 Hoy estoy
 Pensando en ti
 
 Debes saber
 Que hay pedazos de tu boca sin querer
 Regados por aqu'
 Y que tropiezo cada d'a sin pensar
 Con un viejo recuerdo mas
 Y alguna nueva historia gris
 Si no puedo estar contigo
 Ya no puedo estar sin ti
 Cada vez se hace mas duro ser feliz
 
 Me sigue rodeando
 La sombra de ti
 Y siguen rodando por ah'
 Todas las palabras que dijimos
 Y los besos que nos dimos
 Como siempre
 Hoy estoy
 Pensando en ti
 
 Todas las palabras que dijimos
 Y los besos que nos dimos
 Como siempre
 Hoy estoy
 Pensando en ti
 
 Quand tu, quand tu me prends dans tes bras
 Quend je regarde dans tes yeux, je vois qu'un Dieu existe
 C'est pas dur d'y croire
 
 Before I met you I wasn't terribly lucky
 Every prince charming lost charm after twelve
 But then you came and made the past look so funny
 Put my old sadness to sleep on a shelf
 
 If this was meant to be
 Don't condemn me to be free
 And even if we never marry
 I will always love you, baby, childishly
 
 'Cause something, you've got something I can't resist
 Things are what they will be when I look into your eyes they say to me
 That God still exists
 
 And there's something, you've got something I can't resist
 Things are what they will be when I look into your eyes they say to me
 That God still exists
 
 You make me believe
 You make me believe
 
 I love the temperature and smell of your body
 And the shape of your lips and the size of your nose
 I love that everything you say is so funny
 Plus you're the best kisser that I've ever known
 
 You've seen the way I am
 Without makeup, without clothes
 And you accept me like nobody
 And I will always love you baby
 With eyes closed
 
 'Cause something, you've got something I can't resist
 Things are what they will be when I look into your eyes they say to me
 That God still exists
 
 And there's something, you've got something I can't resist
 Things are what they will be when I look into your eyes they say to me
 That God still exists
 
 You make me believe
 You make me believe
 
 Quand tu, quand tu me prends dans tes bras
 Quend je regarde dans tes yeux
 Je vois qu'un Dieu existe, c'est pas dur d'y croire
 
 And there's something, I believe
 There's something, I believe
 There's something
 I believe, I do
 
 You make me believe
 
 Boy meets a girl
 Hid behind a wall
 Piling up the bricks
 Hoping they would fall
 
 Girl meets a boy
 Surrenders to his charms
 Leaves her old boyfriend and crumbles in his arms
 
 And if they wanna make me pay now
 Then go on
 Cause loving you was never wrong
 
 Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
 And it's hurting my eyes
 'Cause it's so bright 
 But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
 And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind
 
 Lazy for a while
 Laying golden eggs
 Some just want your money or whatever they can take
 
 But hearing your name
 Don't need anyone else
 You're here because you want me
 And not for what I make
 
 Hey, they better know
 If there is a price to pay now, the game is on
 Cause in the end you know I won
 
 Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
 And it's hurting my eyes
 'Cause it's so bright 
 But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
 And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind
 
 And every camera flash my way
 And every word of every page
 Well they can say whatever they want to
 Cause what we got is just so real
 That they can't feel the way I feel
 'Cause I would do it all again for you
 
 Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
 And it's hurting my eyes
 'Cause it's so bright 
 But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
 And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind
 
 Here is my life in the spotlight, spotlight
 And it's hurting my eyes
 'Cause it's so bright 
 But you are the thing I was missing and I couldn't find
 And I wouldn't give you up even if I ended blind
 
 Slow motion
 Blinds are see through
 Let your mind go
 Imagine that I kiss you
 
 Turn off the lights and open up your eyes now
 You can take a glimpse into my soul for tonight
 
 Do you got the heat off girl? 
 Can you turn up the temperature? 
 Colombian with a swagger 
 
 Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna
 Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna
 
 There's a spy by my window 
 I know it's you 
 You like to keep an eye on me 
 I know you like to keep an eye on me
 
 There's a spy by my window
 I know it's you 
 Won't you like to keep an eye on me
 I know you like to keep an eye on me 
 Keep an eye on me
 But if you want it got to let it be
 
 I know you
 Dream about me
 And it turns me on to think about it
 This is the finest game
 It ain't even got a name
 I just wanna see how far it takes us tonight
 
 Do you got the music on girl? Yes I do
 Can you get a little closer? You bet I could
 Colombian with a swagger, yes I am
 
 Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna
 Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna
 Whatever it takes to make this thing work we gonna
 
 There's a spy by my window
 I know it's you 
 You like to keep an eye on me
 I know you like to keep an eye on me 
 
 There's a spy by my window
 I know it's you 
 Won't you like to keep an eye on me
 I know you like to keep an eye on me 
 Keep an eye on me
 But if you want it got to let it be
 
 When the dog's away that's when the cat's play
 Yup yup you'll be my girl, I'll be the spy
 Like the James Bond flick girl I'm ready to ride
 
 When the cat's away that's when the mouse play
 Yup yup you'll be my girl, I'll be the spy
 Like the James Bond flick girl I'm ready to die, die die
 
 There's a spy by my window
 I know it's you
 You like to keep an eye on me
 I know you like to keep an eye on me 
 
 There's a spy by my window
 I know it's you
 Won't you like to keep an eye on me
 I know you like to keep an eye on me 
 Keep an eye on me
 But if you want it got to let it be
 
 Lipstick's on
 Stockings up
 Skirt's short
 Heels are high
 Take your time
 Buckle up
 
 Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
 Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
 Close your eyes 
 Close your eyes and enjoy the ride
 
 Perteneciste a una raza antigua
 De pies descalzos y de sue'os blancos
 Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
 Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es blando
 
 Tu mordiste la manzana y renunciaste al para'so
 Y condenaste a una serpiente siendo t' el que as' lo quiso
 Por milenios y milenios permaneciste desnudo
 Y te enfrentaste a dinosaurios bajo un techo y sin escudo
 
 Y ahora estas aqui
 Queriendo ser feliz
 Cuando no te importo
 Un pepino tu destino
 
 Perteneciste a una raza antigua
 De pies descalzos y de sue'os blancos
 Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
 Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es blando
 
 Construiste un mundo exacto de acabados tan perfectos
 Cada cosa calculada en su espacio y a su tiempo
 Yo que soy un caos completo, las entradas, las salidas
 Los nombres y las medidas no me caben en los sesos
 
 Y ahora estas aqui
 Queriendo ser feliz
 Cuando no te importo
 Un pepino tu destino
 
 Perteneciste a una raza antigua
 De pies descalzos y de sue'os blancos
 Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
 Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es
 
 Perteneciste a una raza antigua
 De pies descalzos y de sue'os blancos
 Fuiste polvo, polvo eres
 Piensa que el hierro siempre al calor es blando
 
 Saludar al vecino acostarse a una hora
 Trabajar cada d'a para vivir en la vida
 Y contestar solo aquello y sentir solo esto
 Y que Dios nos ampare de malos pensamientos
 
 Cumplir con las tareas, asistir al colegio
 Que dir'a la familia si eres un fracasado?
 Ponte siempre zapatos, no hagas ruido en la mesa
 Usa medias veladas y corbata en las fiestas
 
 Las mujeres se casan siempre antes de 30
 Si no vestiran santos y aunque as' no lo quieran
 Y en la fiesta de quince es mejor no olvidar
 Una fina champa'a y bailar bien el vals
 Y bailar bien el vals
 
 Suerte que en el sur hayas nacido
 Y que burlemos las distancias
 Suerte que es haberte conocido
 Y por ti amar tierras extra'as
 Yo puedo escalar los Andes solo
 Por ir a contar tus lunares
 Contigo celebro y sufro todo
 Mis alegr'as y mis males
 
 Le ro lo le lo le
 Le ro lo le lo le
 Sabes que estoy a tus pies
 
 Contigo, mi vida
 Quiero vivir la vida
 Y lo que me queda de vida
 Quiero vivir contigo
 Contigo mi vida
 Quiero vivir la vida
 Y lo que me queda de vida
 Quiero vivir contigo
 
 Suerte que es tener labios sinceros
 Para besarte con mas ganas
 Suerte que mis pechos sean peque'os
 Y nos los confundas con monta'as
 Suerte que herede las piernas firmes
 Para correr si un d'a hace falta
 Y estos dos ojos que me dicen
 Que he de llorar cuando te vallas
 
 Le ro lo le lo le
 Le ro lo le lo le
 Sabes que estoy a tus pies
 
 Contigo, mi vida
 Quiero vivir la vida
 Y lo que me queda de vida
 Quiero vivir contigo
 Contigo, mi vida
 Quiero vivir la vida
 Y lo que me queda de vida
 Quiero vivir contigo
 
 Le ro lo le lo le
 Le ro lo le lo le
 Sabes que estoy a tus pies
 
 Le ro lo le lo le
 La felicidad
 tiene tu nombre y tu piel
 
 Contigo, mi vida
 Quiero vivir la vida
 Y lo que me queda de vida
 Quiero vivir contigo
 Ya sabes mi vida
 Estoy hasta el cuello por ti
 Si sientes algo as'
 Quiero que te quedes junto a mi
 
 Contigo, mi vida
 Quiero vivir la vida
 Y lo que me queda de vida
 Quiero vivir contigo
 Ya sabes mi vida
 Estoy hasta el cuello por ti
 Si sientes algo as'
 Quiero que te quedes junto a mi
 
 I wanna send this one out to my vanilla ice-cream chocolate pudding pie
 That stayed with me in the hood, do or die
 Refugee camp
 
 Yeah, this one goes out to my almond joy
 My banana that never split
 The one that stuck with me
 
 Before I had the bling bling
 I thought I'd hit up in sing sing
 Who would have ever thought that we'd be doing our thing
 I know I did a little cheating
 But once I got caught
 I send you a parcel of roses
 You sent them back and told me go to hell
 
 But girl you know that, you take me as I am
 Even though my fam don't understand
 Why I put that rock up on your hand
 That's cos you take me as I am 
 
 You take me as I am 
 Even when my girls can't understand
 I choose you as my man
 But you take me as I am, my, my man
 
 You're my girl 
 You're my girl 
 You're my lady 
 You're my baby
 
 When I was rocking jelly and had a little belly
 Who woulda ever thought, you'd think I was sexy
 I say it with an attitude, I admit I came off rude
 But still you love me, I know I get on your nerves sometimes
 
 And I don't know why you take me as I am
 Even when my girls can't understand
 I choose you as my man 
 Cause you take me as I am 
 
 You take me as I am, girl I'm a take you as you are
 Even though my fam don't understand 
 Why I put that rock up on your hand 
 That's cause you take me as I am
 
 You're my girl 
 You're my girl 
 You're my lady 
 You're my baby 
 
 You're the ocean that breathes that I feel when I'm blowing my trees alone
 
 You're the sun that shines when the darkness strikes at night
 
 You're the love of my life, you're my girl, you're my wife
 
 You're mine, and I'm yours, you take me as I am
 Wait a minute
 
 Can't believe you take me as I am, am, am, no, oh
 Even when they don't understand why you love me
 I choose you as my man
 Cause you take me as I am 
 
 You take me as I am, girl I'm a take you as you are
 Even though my fam don't understand
 My people on the block, they don't understand, no, no
 Why I put that rock up on your hand
 Cause I take you as you are, you're a star
 
 You're my girl 
 You're my girl 
 You're my lady 
 You're my baby 
 
 Nunca pens' que doliera el amor as'
 Cuando se entierra en el medio de un no y un s'
 Es un d'a ella y otro d'a yo
 Me est's dejando sin coraz'n
 Y cero de raz'n
 
 Ay, te aviso y te anuncio que hoy renuncio
 A tus negocios sucios
 Ya sabes que estoy de ti vacunada
 A prueba de patadas
 Por ti me qued' como Mona Lisa
 Sin llanto y sin sonrisa
 Que el cielo y tu madre cuiden de ti
 Me voy, ser' mejor as'
 
 S' que olvidarte no es asunto sencillo
 Te me clavaste en el cuerpo como un cuchillo
 Pero todo lo que entra ha de salir
 Y los que est'n tendr'n que partir
 Empezando por m'
 
 Ay, te aviso y te anuncio que hoy renuncio
 A tus negocios sucios
 Ya sabes que estoy de ti vacunada
 A prueba de patadas
 Por ti me qued' como Mona Lisa
 Sin llanto y sin sonrisa
 Que el cielo y tu madre cuiden de ti
 Me voy, me me me me voy
 
 Tal vez t' no eres ese para m'
 No s' como se puede ya vivir
 Pero era as'
 
 Es tan pat'tico, neur'tico, sat'rico, psic'tico
 T' no lo ves, el tango no es de tres, llevo planeando escapar
 Y me sale al rev's pero voy a intentarlo una y otra vez
 
 Ay, te aviso te anuncio que hoy renuncio
 A tus negocios sucios
 Por ti me quede como Mona Lisa
 Sin llanto y sin sonrisa
 Te aviso que estoy de ti vacunada y no me importa nada
 Que el cielo y tu madre cuiden de ti
 Me voy ser' mejor as'
 Ya me voy
 Ya me fui
 Es mejor asi
 
 Ay, que el cielo y tu madre cuiden de ti
 Me voy, ay ay ay
 Ay, que el cielo y tu madre cuiden de ti
 Me voy ser' mejor as'
 
 Si ya es hora de esconder
 Del mundo el dolor
 Bajo la piel
 M's se que estar' bien
 Los gatos como yo caen de pie
 No quiero
 Jugar mi suerte por ti
 No puedo
 Con V peque'a vivir
 Pronto estar' de aqu'
 Muy muy lejos
 
 Ay me voy otra vez
 Ah' te dejo Madrid
 Tus rutinas de piel
 Y tus ganas de huir
 Yo no quiero cobardes
 Que me hagan sufrir
 Mejor le digo adi's
 A tu boca de an's
 
 Si ya es hora de limpiar
 Las manchas de miel
 Sobre el mantel
 Yo nunca supe actuar
 Y mis labios se ven
 Muertos de sed
 
 No quiero dejarlo todo a lazar
 Entiendo
 Que he comenzado a estorbar
 Pronto estar' de ti
 Muy muy lejos
 
 Ay me voy otra vez
 Ah' te dejo Madrid
 Tus rutinas de piel
 Y tus ganas de huir
 Yo no quiero cobardes
 Que me hagan sufrir
 Mejor le digo adi's
 
 A tu boca de an's
 
 Te espero sentada en la esquina de siempre
 Y m's arreglada que si fuera un viernes
 Sin ninguna cita hecha previamente
 Pero con la plena intuici'n de verte
 
 Mis ojos no paran de mirar y mirar
 El oscuro pedernal de las ideas
 Buscando m's huecos dentro de este hueco
 Buscando una luz en medio de este cielo
 
 Mi cielo, mi cielo
 Pobre de mi cielo
 
 Mis manos las guardo porque tengo fr'o
 Y se sienten raras dentro del bolsillo
 Ha pasado ya m's de una hora y media
 No has aparecido, me fall' mi instinto
 
 Pero es que mi instinto
 No sabe de amores
 Pero es que mi instinto
 No sabe que
 
 Vivir la vida sin ti
 Es algo como morir
 Es caminar sin mirar
 Es como cantar sin o'r
 Es hablar sin respirar
 Es comer sin digerir
 Porque yo descubr' que eres la forma perfecta
 La medida exacta justa para mi y es as'
 
 Mi cielo, mi cielo
 No sabe que
 
 Vivir la vida sin ti
 Es algo como morir
 Es caminar sin mirar
 Es como cantar sin o'r
 Es hablar sin respirar
 Es comer sin digerir
 Porque yo descubr' que eres la forma perfecta
 La medida exacta justa para mi
 
 Y es algo como morir
 Es caminar sin mirar
 Es como cantar sin sentir
 Es hablar sin respirar
 Es comer sin digerir
 Porque yo descubr' que eres la forma perfecta
 La medida exacta justa para mi
 
 Si es la lluvia de todos los d'as
 Que ha aumentado su nivel
 Ya la m'sica no tiene el mismo
 Efecto que sol'a tener
 
 Tal vez haya vivido tanto
 En tan poco y tan corto tiempo
 Que no s' ni que idioma hablo
 Ni que velas cargo dentro
 De este entierro
 
 Siento que no tengo fuerzas ya
 Para saltar y agarrar el sol
 Y por m's que yo lo intente
 No me escucho ni mi propia voz
 
 Ya no s' si he vivido diez mil d'as
 O un d'a, diez mil veces
 Y te sumo a mi historia
 Queriendo cambiar las p'rdidas
 Por creces
 
 Te necesito, te necesito mi amor
 Donde quiera que tu est's
 Me hace falta tu calor
 Te necesito, te necesito mi amor
 Porque eres parte de m'
 Te necesito aqu'
 Y es que no s' vivir sin ti
 No he aprendido
 
 Y me encuentro as' perdida
 Como una aguja en un pajar
 Como arenas movedizas
 Me sumerjo
 Entre mi soledad
 
 Ya no s' si he vivido diez mil d'as
 O un d'a, diez mil veces
 Y te sumo a mi historia
 Queriendo cambiar las p'rdidas
 Por creces
 
 Te necesito, te necesito mi amor
 Donde quiera que tu est's
 Me hace falta tu calor
 Te necesito, te necesito mi amor
 Porque eres parte de m'
 Te necesito aqu'
 Y es que no s' vivir sin ti
 No he aprendido
 
 I've got my baggage
 And you've got yours
 I know we've been damaged
 Been through it all
 
 And you know that feeling
 Just before a beautiful disaster
 Right on the top
 Looking down from the terrifying
 Rolling roller coaster
 
 Oh, baby, can you hear the sound?
 My broken heart's beating faster now
 In your arms
 But I know that I'm safe here in your arms
 
 Lay down
 Lay down your head on my shoulder
 Hey now
 Let's just depart from the notion
 That I love you too much
 And I'm here to stay
 I'm not giving up
 I'm not running away
 So we're going to leave it that way
 That way
 
 This is much bigger than you and I
 To live without love would be suicide
 I think you'll would soon close your pretty eyes
 I like you hear your breathing
 It's like the soundtrack of your life
 The only memory I'm keeping
 
 Oh, baby, can you hear the sound?
 Your broken heart is beating faster now
 In my arms
 I promise that you're safe here in my arms
 
 Lay down
 Lay down your head on my shoulder
 Hey now
 Let's just depart from the notion
 That I love you too much
 And I'm here to stay
 I'm not giving up
 I'm not running away
 So we're going to leave it that way
 We're going to leave it that way
 That way
 
 Who's to say that we always have to agree
 I think we can both can take this one mistake like some kind of amnesty
 
 And why to love and with such brutality?
 We're compatible
 Maybe a bit too much, that's our ambiguity
 
 I've cried a thousand storms
 I've blown away the clouds
 The heartbeat of the sun is racing mine, I'm reaching out
 My heart is waiting
 
 This is the day and the time
 I wanna believe that we may still have a chance
 We took a leap in the dark
 And I can see now
 How shadows have turned to light
 
 Well, we know
 How ephemeral are things
 Disillusion takes what illusion gives, what's the use of make believe?
 
 The needles of the clock
 Are moving right to left
 Pretend we never heard of things we said, like we've been deaf
 And start all over
 
 This is the day and the time
 I wanna believe that we may still have a chance
 We took a leap in the dark
 And I can see now
 How shadows have turned to light
 
 Ah
 
 Heartbeat of the sun is racing mine, I'm missing out
 
 Ah
 
 This is the day and the time
 I wanna believe that we may still have a chance
 We took a leap in the dark
 And I can see now
 That shadows have turned to light
 
 Ah
 
 The time
 
 Ah
 Ooh-ooh
 
 Ah
 Ah, ah
 Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
 
 So I find a reason to shave my legs
 Each single morning
 So I count on someone on Friday nights
 To take me dancing and then
 To church on Sundays
 To plant more dreams
 And someday think of kids
 Or maybe just to save a little money
 
 You're the one I need
 The way back home is always long
 But if you're close to me I'm holding on
 You're the one I need
 My real life has just begun
 'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun
 
 In the world full of strangers
 You're the one I know
 
 So I learned to cook and finally lose
 My kitchen phobia
 And so I got the arms to cuddle in
 When there's a ghost or a muse
 That brings insomnia
 To buy more thongs
 To write more happy songs
 It always takes a little help from someone
 
 You're the one I need
 The way back home is always long
 But if you're close to me I'm holding on
 You're the one I need
 My real life has just begun
 'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun
 
 You're the one I need
 The way back home is always long
 But if you're close to me I'm holding on
 You're the one I need
 My real life has just begun
 'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun
 
 You're the one I need
 You're the one I need
 
 You're, my real life has just begun
 
 You're the one I need
 You're the one I need
 
 Nothing like your smile made of sun
 
 Nothing like your love
 Nothing like your love
 Nothing like your love
 
 Every morning when I woke up
 I was choked up
 I was leaving without a purpose
 Always jumping all the hurdles
 Doing circles in the dark with a broken compass
 
 I can't explain the way it feels
 I could trip on my own words
 I make mistakes, that's much is clear
 But I made it here my love
 Yeah I made it here my love
 
 You are the one thing that I got right
 It's a big ol' world, yeah, it's a big ol' world
 You turn the darkness into sun light
 I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
 And if mess up everything someday
 I would hide my head in shame
 Cause you're the one thing that I got right
 
 One thing I got right
 One thing I got right
 
 Every morning when you wake up
 I wanna hold you
 I just need to be wrapped around you
 It's kinda funny when you think that you just got here
 Now I know I can't live without you
 
 I can't explain the way it feels
 I could choke my own words
 Sometimes it seems like it ain't real
 Like you're really here my love, yeah, you're really here my love
 
 You're the one thing that I got right
 It's a big ol' world, yeah, it's a big ol' world
 You turn the darkness into sun light
 I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
 And if mess up everything someday
 I would hide my head in shame
 Cause you're the one thing that I got right
 
 Every time I see your smile
 Every time I hear your laugh
 Baby you bring in new sunshine over now
 You are the little dream
 Ever since I was a child
 My fairytale comes true when I look at your face
 May not be here forever
 But it'll be a long road together
 I already know
 We're gonna be fine, fine, fine
 We're gonna be just fine, fine, fine
 
 You are the one thing that I got right
 It's a big ol' world, yeah, it's a big ol' world
 You turn the darkness into sun light
 I'm a lucky girl, yeah, I'm a lucky girl
 And if mess up everything someday
 I won't hide my head in shame
 Cause you're the one thing that I got right
 
 You're the one thing that I got right
 And if mess up everything someday
 I won't hide my head in shame
 Cause you're the one thing that I got right
 You're the one thing that I got right
 
 One thing I got right
 One thing I got right

 Going on and on and on and on
 This is going on and on and on and on now
 Said it once and say it twice, I want to save your time
 Safety, safety
 
 It's alright, it's alright
 'Cause the system never fails
 The good guys are in power and the bad guys are in jail
 
 It's alright, it's alright
 Just as long as we can vote
 We live in democracy and that's what we promote
 
 Isn't it, sn't it? 
 Isn't it, isn't it? 
 
 It's alright, it's alright
 At least there's half the truth
 Hearing what we want's the secret of eternal youth
 
 It's alright, it's alright
 The planet's split in three
 'Cause I'll keep on selling records and you've got your MTV
 
 If we forget about 'em
 Don't worry
 If they forget about us
 Then hurry
 How about the people who don't matter anymore?
 
 East Timor, Timor, Timor
 Ooh
 Ah, ah, ah, ah
 Ah, ah, ah, ah
 
 It's alright, it's alright
 We'll show all on TV
 So we won't really know it just by watching **BC
 
 It's alright, it's alright
 For a flag we die or kill
 As long as we don't know it, do it just to pay the bills
 
 If we forget about 'em
 Don't worry
 If they forget about us
 Then hurry
 How about the people who don't matter anymore?
 
 If we forget about 'em
 Don't worry
 If they forget about us
 Then hurry
 How about the people who don't matter anymore?
 
 East Timor, Timor, Timor
 
 Let's keep telling the world it's sunny
 They risk their hides to make the money
 Now don't you find that funny?
 
 If we forget about 'em
 If they forget about us
 Then hurry
 
 If we forget about 'em
 Don't worry
 If they forget about us
 Then hurry

 En el c'mputo global de las cosas si debemos hacer un recuento
 No me dejas ser infeliz a pesar de mis intentos
 Eres como un querub'n que vuela y vuela y vuela
 Cantando canciones de amor cerca de m' aunque me duela
 
 Es el sol detr's de tu risa
 Que me ciega y me deslumbra
 Y tu piel que roza la m'a
 Pero a'n no se acostumbra
 Es la luz detr's de tus ojos
 Que ilumina mi penumbra
 Y que va brillando m's fuerte y soy feliz, muy feliz
 
 Y me das toneladas masivas de amor
 No dejas un respiro a mi coraz'n
 T' me armas, me desarmas
 Nunca me dejas caer
 Tan bajo me levantas
 
 Para m' este mundo sin t' no ser'a m's que un mal invento
 Una p'sima combinaci'n de mucho estr's y aburrimiento
 Y si no fuera por ti, habr'a renunciado a mis sue'os
 Y si no fuera por ti, ir'a como un perro sin due'o
 
 Es el sol detr's de tu risa
 Que me ciega y me deslumbra
 Y tu piel que roza la m'a
 Pero a'n no se acostumbra
 Solo t' con media palabra
 Me construyes o me derrumbas
 Junto a ti me siento mas fuerte y soy feliz, muy feliz
 
 Y me das toneladas masivas de amor
 No dejas un respiro a mi coraz'n
 T' me armas, me desarmas
 Nunca me dejas caer
 Tan bajo me levantas
 Toneladas masivas de amor
 No dejas un respiro a mi coraz'n
 T' me armas, me desarmas
 Nunca me dejas caer
 Tan bajo me levantas
 
 Quiere que lo hagamos en diferentes partes
 Pero estoy cansada de desilusiones
 Hace mucho tiempo no creo en los hombres
 Y no necesito de este mal de amores
 
 Me pide y yo le doy
 Sabe que siempre aqu' estoy
 Casi siempre llama tarde y nunca cambia el dirty boy
 Quiero besarte
 Satisfacerte
 Oye baby no me niegues, v'monos
 
 Quiere que se lo haga en diferentes partes
 Ella est' cansada de desilusiones
 No quiere saber de un rompecorazones
 Ll'mame cuando quieras beba
 Quiere que lo hagamos en diferentes partes
 Pero estoy cansada de desilusiones
 No quiero saber de un rompecorazones
 Ll'mame cuando quieras beba
 
 Tu mu'vete encima de m'
 Compl'ceme
 Ay beb'
 Tu mu'vete encima de m'
 Compl'ceme
 Cuando tu quieras baby
 V'monos, perd'monos
 De la realidad escap'monos
 En la cama tu y yo mord'monos
 Con eso que naciste, d'melo
 
 Quiere que se lo haga en diferentes partes
 Ella est' cansada de desilusiones
 No quiere saber de un rompecorazones
 Ll'mame cuando quieras beba
 Quiere que se lo haga en diferentes partes
 Ella est' cansada de desilusiones
 No quiere saber de un rompecorazones
 Ll'mame cuando quieras beba
 
 Dale una prueba
 Ponle Nutella
 T' solo disfruta, que las horas vuelan
 
 Haci'ndolo
 Inolvidable aventura
 35 mil pies de altura
 Habernos ido al crucero
 Pude ver como te desnudas
 Yo espero menos de t'
 Me gusta hacerte sentir
 Y si firmo el contrato, contigo quiero repetir
 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 Ah
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 Ah
 
 Quiere que se lo haga en diferentes partes
 Pero estoy cansada de desilusiones
 No quiero saber de un rompecorazones
 Ll'mame cuando quieras beba
 Quiere que se lo haga en diferentes partes
 Ella est' cansada de desilusiones
 No quiere saber de un rompecorazones
 Ll'mame cuando quieras beba
 
 I messed up tonight
 I lost another fight
 I still mess up but I'll just start again
 I keep falling down
 I keep on hitting the ground
 I always get up now to see what's next
 Birds don't just fly
 They fall down and get up
 Nobody learns without getting it won
 
 I won't give up, no I won't give in
 Till I reach the end
 And then I'll start again
 Though I'm on the lead
 I wanna try everything
 I wanna try even though I could fail
 I won't give up, no I won't give in
 Till I reach the end
 And then I'll start again
 No I won't leave
 I wanna try everything
 I wanna try even though I could fail
 
 Oh oh try everything
 
 Look how far you've come
 You filled your heart with love
 Baby you've done enough that cut your breath
 Don't beat yourself up
 Don't need to run so fast
 Sometimes we come last but we did our best
 
 I won't give up, no I won't give in
 Till I reach the end
 And then I'll start again
 Though I'm on the lead
 I wanna try everything
 I wanna try even though I could fail
 I won't give up, no I won't give in
 Till I reach the end
 And then I'll start again
 No I won't leave
 I wanna try everything
 I wanna try even though I could fail
 
 I'll keep on making those new mistakes
 I'll keep on making them every day
 Those new mistakes
 
 Oh oh, try everything
 
 Te regalo mi cintura
 Y mis labios para cuando quieras besar
 Te regalo mi locura
 Y las pocas neuronas que quedan ya
 
 Mis zapatos deste'idos
 El diario en el que escribo
 Te doy hasta mi suspiro
 Pero no te vayas mas
 
 Porque eres tu mi sol
 La fe con que vivo
 La potencia de mi voz
 Los pies con que camino
 Eres tu amor
 Mis ganas de re'r
 El adi's que no sabre decir
 Porque nunca podre vivir sin ti
 
 Si alg'n d'a decidieras
 Alejarte nuevamente de aqu'
 Cerrar'a cada puerta
 Para que nunca pudieras salir
 
 Te regalo mis silencios
 Te regalo mi nariz
 Yo te doy hasta mis huesos
 Pero qu'date aqu'
 
 Porque eres tu mi sol
 La fe con que vivo
 La potencia de mi voy
 Los pies con que camino
 Eres tu amor
 Mis ganas de re'r
 El adi's que no sabre decir
 Porque nunca podre vivir sin ti
 
 Algo flota en el aire
 Como una premonici'n
 Sabes que tu boca
 Es el destino de mi piel
 Y mi otra religi'n
 Excitando
 
 Dame una se'al, ven y borra la espera
 No calmes mi sed con el agua del mar
 Que lo que no hace bien
 Solo puede hacer mal
 
 Tu boca lo sabe
 Cosa que toca, cosa que arde
 
 Me pides tanto que es imposible
 Evitar la tentaci'n
 Eres una cosa irresistible
 Y tu boca mi adicci'n
 Excitando
 
 Me dejar' quemar por el fuego en tu risa
 Oyendo el sonido de tu respirar
 Que lo que no hace bien
 Solo puede hacer mal
 
 Tu boca lo sabe
 Cosa que toca, cosa que arde
 No es culpa de nadie
 Cosa que toca, cosa que arde
 
 Tu boca lo sabe
 Cosa que toca, cosa que arde
 No es culpa de nadie
 Cosa que toca, cosa que arde
 
 En la agenda de mis dias
 en sus paginas queridas
 estoy yo tras tu experiencia de vivir
 y siempre tu fuerza que me gu'a
 aliviaste mis heridas
 y el empuje de tu amor
 me da el valor,
 mi alma
 nadie la conoce tanto como tu
 mi vida
 yo la veo reflejada en ti.
 Pues mi historia tu seras
 me guiaste en la oscuridad
 y a mi lado siempre estzs
 cuando llamo yo,
 cuando llamo yo.
 Quiero amarte y darte mas
 y si yo escribiera un libro
 te diro de aqui al final
 que mi historia
 que mi historia tu seras.
 Yo no pienso en el manana
 tan feliz o en la tristeza
 buscare donde te encuentres tu
 pues me pierdo sin tu amor
 y sere tu fiel amiga
 como el aire que respiras
 sanare tu corazon.
 Pues mi historia tu seras...
 
 Que me paso
 fue un impacto
 aqui en mi corazon
 cuando oia en el
 encontre tu mirada y tu voz
 busco mi alma
 Asi empezo
 circulaba en la calle
 que este mundo ya estaba en funci'n
 con su circo pero entre los dos
 no importaba
 Ahora me dices
 tu me gustas y me callo
 bajo la vista tu mirada es un taladro
 es mi emocion
 y si el telefono resuena con un salto
 y me da rabia cuando llama equivocado
 no por favor.
 Ultimo momento
 la noticia es que me he enamorado.
 Ultimo momento
 basta de dias vacios, te amo.
 Ultimo momento
 los noticieros debieran dictarlo.
 Ultimo momento,
 ultimo momento,
 ultimo momento.
 Que me paso
 en las calles los ninos de Dios
 se decian obreros del Senor
 no me inquieta porque esta canci'n es solo una alarma.
 Asi empezo
 sin querer me trajiste el amor
 y la verdad es que es lo mejor
 que paso en mi vida
 el buzon pide tus cartas
 Ahora me dices
 como si si no querias
 hasta el metal que es mas fuerte
 algun dia se oxida
 y eso paso.
 Los titulares no se como no se olvidan
 y con un latigo chasguean mis heridas
 por la audicion.
 
 Hoy es un d'a de aquellos
 En que miro hacia el cielo
 Tratando de descifrar el que est's
 De vez en cuando lejos
 Y de vez en cuando cerca
 Unas veces subir
 Y otras caer y yo
 Cuando t' te me acercas
 No respondo de mis actos
 Siento que aqu' voy
 De odiarte a quererte
 De principio a fin
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Hay cosas en la vida
 En que no encuentras salida
 Y ante tus ojos se cierra el tel'n
 Y tapas la boquilla del volc'n
 Que se hace lava que hace
 Mil a'os est' aqu' dentro y yo
 Tejiendo redecillas para ver si
 Puedo atraparte y aqu' voy
 Colando la macilla en medio de
 Este tr'pico mortal
 
 Y aqu' voy tejiendo redecillas
 Para ver si puedo atraparte
 Y aqu' estoy
 Colando la macilla en medio de
 Este tr'pico mortal
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 Buscando un poco de amor
 
 You're a song written by the hands of God
 Don't get me wrong 'cause this might sound to you a bit odd
 But you own the place where all my thoughts go hiding
 Right under your clothes, is where I find them
 
 Underneath your clothes
 There's an endless story
 There's the man I chose
 There's my territory
 And all the things I deserve
 For being such a good girl honey
 
 'Cause of you, I forgot the smart ways to lie
 Because of you, I'm running out of reasons to cry
 When the friends are gone, when the party's over
 We will still belong to each other
 
 Underneath your clothes
 There's an endless story
 There's the man I chose
 There's my territory
 And all the things I deserve
 For being such a good girl honey
 
 Underneath your clothes
 There's an endless story
 There's the man I chose
 There's my territory
 And all the things I deserve
 For being such a good girl
 For being such a, hey
 
 I love you more than all that's on the planet
 Movin', talkin', walkin', breathin'
 You know it's true
 Oh baby it's so funny almost don't believe it
 
 As every voice is hangin' from the silence
 Lamps are hangin' from the ceilin'
 Like a lady tied to her manners
 I'm tied up to this feeling
 
 Underneath your clothes
 There's an endless story
 There's the man I chose
 There's my territory
 And all the things I deserve
 For being such a good girl honey
 
 Underneath your clothes
 Whoa
 There's the man I chose
 There's my territory
 And all the things I deserve
 For being such a good girl
 For being such a good girl
 
 Fr'a como una estatua de sal
 En un mausoleo de cristal
 Seca hasta los huesos por llorar
 Y muerta como puede estar Tiberio en su huacal
 
 Toda en ruinas como el Parten'n
 Sola como termin' Col'n
 P'lida como una Mona Lisa
 Amargada como un lim'n
 Arrugada como acorde'n
 
 Como la Esfinge cuando perdi' su nariz
 Como Alejandro Magno
 Sin su espada y sin su dardo
 Como un pobre cristiano en pleno Imperio Romano
 
 Busco algo que pueda contestar
 Porque estoy cansada de pensar
 C'mo es que transcurren los segundos
 Y yo sobrevivo a este diluvio universal
 
 Sin m's esfuerzo la explicaci'n
 Aparece en un viejo caj'n
 Y en menos de una sola fracci'n
 Vuelve a vivir y se viste de verde el coraz'n
 
 Como la Esfinge cuando perdi' su nariz
 Como Alejandro Magno
 Sin su espada y sin su dardo
 Como un pobre Cristiano en pleno Imperio Romano
 
 Vuelve, vuelve
 Vuelve, vuelve
 
 Que mi vida se desliza por un ca'o
 Que mis pies de estar parados tienen callos
 Ya no s' c'mo decirte que te extra'o
 Y ya en 'stas he pasado m's de un a'o
 
 Vuelve, vuelve
 Vuelve, vuelve
 
 Que mi barca se est' hundiendo en el lodo
 Que de angustia me he mordido hasta los codos
 Que mi mundo est' vac'o y aburrido
 Que me muero por tenerte aqu' conmigo
 
 Vuelve, vuelve
 Vuelve, vuelve
 
 Lleg' el momento, caen las murallas
 Va a comenzar la 'nica justa de la batallas
 No duele el golpe, no existe el miedo
 Qu'tate el polvo, ponte de pie y vuelves al ruedo
 
 Y la presi'n se siente
 Espera en ti, tu gente
 Ahora vamos por todo
 Y te acompa'a la suerte
 Tsamina mina zangalewa
 Porque esto es 'frica

 Oye a tu Dios
 Y no estar's solo

 Hay que empezar de cero
 Para tocar el cielo

 I'm living with a broken heart
 I never meant to do you harm
 Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
 And everybody hurts sometimes
 I never meant to do you wrong
 I know you're gonna be just fine, you said
 
 I wish we could go back in time
 See the world with different eyes
 Knowing what we both know now
 Could've made it work somehow
 
 What we said, what we say
 What we make we can't unmake
 What we give is what we get
 And this is what we're stuck with now
 But we said, whatever that we said
 What we make you know we can't unmake
 What we give is only what we get
 And this is what we're stuck with now
 
 I'm living with a broken heart
 I never meant to do you harm
 Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
 But everybody hurts sometimes
 I never meant to do you wrong
 I know you're gonna be just fine, you said
 
 I wish we could go back in time
 Find the road that dots in one
 Roll up darling we would be
 Beautiful like harmony
 
 What we said, what we say
 What we make we can't unmake
 What we give is what we get
 And this is what we're stuck with now
 But we said whatever that we said
 What we make you know we can't unmake
 What we get is only what we gave
 And this is what we're stuck with now
 
 I'm living with a broken heart
 I never meant to do you harm
 Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
 But everybody hurts sometimes
 I never meant to do you wrong
 I know you're gonna be just fine, you said
 
 Do you remember how you used to get lost in my eyes
 
 Do you remember how you promised you'd never say goodbye?
 I remember, I remember, I remember
 
 But we said and what we said
 What we make we can't unmake
 What we give is only what we get
 And this is what we're stuck with now
 
 I'm living with a broken heart
 I never meant to do you harm
 Don't ever wanna see you cry, again
 But everybody hurts sometimes
 I never meant to do you wrong
 I know you're gonna be just fine, you said
 Again
 
 When a woman, when a woman loves
 When a woman, when a woman loves a man
 When a woman, when a woman loves
 When a woman, when a woman loves a man
 
 Manipulate and cause you pain
 But lift you up when you're hurting
 Scream goodbye, laugh when you cry
 But cool the tears when they're burning
 I felt it deep inside of me
 Like an explosion of crazy
 All of this fire that you give
 I feel it deep
 
 'Cause only a woman can get this dark
 Only a woman can cause these scars
 Only a woman can love this hard
 Only a woman
 Yeah, when this woman loves a man
 She'll take you to hell and back
 Take you to hell and back
 
 When a woman, when a woman loves
 When a woman, when a woman loves a man
 Only a woman, only a woman knows
 How a woman is supposed to love a man
 When a woman, when a woman loves
 When a woman, when a woman loves a man
 Only a woman, only a woman knows
 Oh, oh
 
 Don't need to hear my apologies
 You're being so damn complicated
 The ups and downs, the outs and ins
 It's what it is
 
 'Cause only a woman can get this dark
 Only a woman can cause these scars
 Only a woman can love this hard
 Only a woman
 Yeah, when this woman loves a man
 She'll take you to hell and back
 Take you to hell and back

 Only a woman, only a woman knows
 Oh, oh
 
 And even when you won't admit
 You know you're gonna need
 To be next to the only woman who can make you feel that kind of fire
 No, you won't get tired
 And when you think it's all I got
 I'll bring it up a notch
 I'll take you on a crazy ride, you'll never get enough
 Baby, I'm your girl
 And this is how I show my love
 
 'Cause only a woman can get this dark
 Only a woman can cause these scars
 Only a woman can love this hard

 Lucky you were born that far away so
 We could both make fun of distance
 Lucky that I love a foreign land for
 The lucky fact of your existence
 
 Baby I would climb the Andes solely
 To count the freckles on your body
 Never could imagine there were only
 Ten million ways to love somebody
 
 Can't you see
 I'm at your feet
 
 Whenever, wherever
 We're meant to be together
 I'll be there and you'll be near
 And that's the deal my dear
 There over, hereunder
 You'll never have to wonder
 We can always play by ear
 But that's the deal my dear
 
 Lucky that my lips not only mumble
 They spill kisses like a fountain
 Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
 So you don't confuse them with mountains
 
 Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
 To run for cover when I need it
 And these two eyes that for no other
 The day you leave will cry a river
 
 At your feet
 I'm at your feet
 
 Whenever, wherever
 We're meant to be together
 I'll be there and you'll be near
 And that's the deal my dear
 Thereover, hereunder
 You'll never have to wonder
 We can always play by ear
 But that's the deal my dear
 
 Think out loud
 Say it again
 Tell me one more time
 That you'll live
 Lost in my eyes
 
 Whenever, wherever
 We're meant to be together
 I'll be there and you'll be near
 And that's the deal my dear
 There over, hereunder
 You've got me head over heels
 There's nothing left to fear
 If you really feel the way I feel
 
 Whenever, wherever
 We're meant to be together
 I'll be there and you'll be near
 And that's the deal my dear
 There over, hereunder
 You've got me head over heels
 There's nothing left to fear
 If you really feel the way I feel
 
 Put your trust in me
 I won't let you down
 Don't delay the things
 That you want right now
 
 Why wait for later?
 Hey I don't you want some action
 I'm not a waiter 
 I like to make things happen
 
 Something's coming on 
 Coming on strong
 Don't take too long
 Don't you wanna know
 Baby come home
 
 One more night with you
 I won't think it through
 Time's money but you knew
 There's nothing in the world you
 Can think of that I won't do to you
 
 Drowning in your sweat
 'Till I drench my clothes
 You've seen nothing yet
 Wait 'till you let go
 
 Why wait for later?
 Obey my intuition
 We're gonna be just fine
 I've got a premonition
 
 Something's coming on
 Coming on strong
 Don't take too long
 Don't you wanna know
 Baby come home
 
 One more night with you
 I won't think it through
 Time's money but you knew
 There's nothing in the world you
 Can think of that I won't do to you
 
 I'm gonna dance through the veil of your eyes
 While you follow my steps in the sand
 I see your fate in the palm of your hand
 
 No one looks, no one hears us this time
 It's only me and your conscious tonight
 If there are no witnesses, there is no crime
 
 Why wait for later?
 I'm not a waiter
 
 Something's coming on
 Coming on strong
 Don't take too long
 Don't you wanna know
 Baby come home
 
 One more night with you
 I won't think it through
 Time's money but you knew
 There's nothing in the world you
 Can think of that I won't do to
 
 One more night with you
 I won't think it through
 Time's money but you knew
 There's nothing in the world you
 Can think of that I won't do to you
 
 I found your t-shirt
 And I stripped your bed
 I left you perfect
 But there's no appreciation
 
 I listened sweetly to your sour tone
 I loved you only
 But there's no reciprocation
 
 Before you came along
 It was all beautiful
 I have nothing left
 In my heart, in my soul
 
 Should have never helped
 You become so powerful
 But I saw a champion in your eyes
 
 You don't care about me
 If you did, you would let me go
 You will eventually
 'Cause you just don't care about me
 
 You don't care if I die
 If you did, you would have spared my life
 I say it confidently
 But you just don't care about me
 
 You say you're thirsty
 So I pour the wine
 The bottle's empty
 But there's no consummation
 
 Before you came along
 It was all beautiful
 I have nothing left
 In my heart, in my soul
 
 Should have never helped
 You become so powerful
 But I saw a champion in your eyes
 
 You don't care about me
 If you did, you would let me go
 You will eventually
 'Cause you just don't care about me
 
 You don't care if I die
 If you did, you would have spared my life
 I say it confidently
 But you just don't care about me
 
 Oh, baby, how we used to dance
 I couldn't separate from your hands
 Now they don't even play that song anymore
 You don't care about me
 
 No, don't care about me
 No, don't care about me
 You don't care about me, no
 Don't care about about me, no
 
 You don't care about me
 If you did, you would let me go
 You will eventually
 'Cause you just don't care about me
 
 You don't care if I die
 If you did, you would have spared my life
 I say it confidently
 But you just don't care about me
 
 Tell me what's the use
 Of a twenty-four inch waist
 If you don't touch me?
 
 Tell me what's the use again
 Of being on TV everyday
 If you don't watch me?
 
 This house is full of emptiness
 My closet's full of dresses that I'll never wear
 My life is full of people
 But you're my only friend, and my best friend
 
 Hope it isn't too late to say I love you
 Hope it isn't too late to say
 That without you this place looks like London, it rains everyday
 Don't you know it babe, I'm only half a body
 Without your embrace
 
 Let me tell you what
 My heart is an unfurnished room
 Any suggestions?
 Don't have to tell you more than that
 'Cause no one knows me like you do
 Without exception
 
 This house is full of emptiness
 My closet's full of dresses that I'll never wear

 Vein!

 New year, it's our year, to be clear, we here
 Immigrant parents but I'm living the American dream for them now
 It's it's it's about to go down
 This is for Eddie, Bobby, Rudy, Johnny
 Up in the sky drinking poly loddy doddy
 I don't need a Maybach or Buggati
 Couple of beds and some sheets, that's a party
 Go DJ, blow the speakers
 All my women wear heels, no sneakers
 Grim reaper, the night is mine
 Meet me at 11:59

 Not let's make a toast
 Reach for the sky right now for it's so much higher than me

 I've played it smart
 Who cares if you run things
 Cuz I'm as live as one O six and park!

 But a pool of blood with a bunch of sharks!
 Only the strong survive, it's do or die
 Get it right! That's why I roll for my peoples!
 Cock back, go to war with my peoples! 
 Break bread with my peoples!
 Man I'll die for my peoples!
 
 Everybody knows is truth

 School ya'll to somethin right quick
 Sit down, open your ears, close your eyes, listen
 
 Here's a little story that I got to tell
 About this Chico named Pit everyone knows so well
 Illmatic like Nas but that ain't hard to tell
 Owes it all to Dade County and the ATL
 Picked rap and skipped the triple beam scale
 And it's a known fact he gon' die before he fails
 These boys rap about hustlin' but can't make bail
 I call that hustling backwards and that's real
 Miami's hot so I can vacation in hell
 The way the game is shit, man, I mind as well
 I look at these fools on camera flashin' they tools
 
 They must've forgot the streets got codes and rules
 But me, I'm confused
 'Cause rappers wanna be gangstas
 Gangstas wanna be rappers
 Ballers wanna be rappers
 And rappers wanna be ballers
 The truth is it's more sickening than Ebola
 Until they handcuff then it's over
 Pop up no dandruff, no neck, just head and shoulders
 Bust guns, sell drugs, that's what the streets showed us
 But corporate America, that's what they sold us
 
 Hey Jim its like these boys wanna make music for the block
 You know there hood there city
 I'm tryin' to make a music cor rth world
 You feel me right b.o.b.
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh
 Oh Oh
 
 I got up today
 And my flight was late
 On my way to L.A
 I jumped up on a plane
 And put on my shades
 And threw on my headphones
 
 I was vibing to this beat
 That made me move my feet
 Boy that thang' was sticky
 
 And then I heard this 
 The dopest one I've ever seen
 Something out the usual
 
 So Mr. Pilot please
 I think I got a hit on you
 Hurry to the studio.
 
 I'll play across the world
 
 Across the world
 I'll play across the world
 
 Across the world
 I'll play across the world
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh
 Oh
 
 Well I got up today
 Put some gas in my tank
 To make it to the studio
 
 And then I heard this beat
 It made me move my feet
 Hell yeah that thing was super dope
 
 And then I sang this 
 The dopest one I've ever seen
 Something out the usual
 So Mr. Engineer
 Turn up the auto tone
 So I'll be on the radio
 
 I'll play across the world
 
 Across the world
 I'll play across the world
 
 Across the world
 I'll play across the world
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh
 Oh Oh
 
 Been around the world
 Same old songs
 Now on stage
 Hit the bras and thongs
 Long way from what I came from
 Fighting in the club
 For just sayin' somethin'
 Now my passports full
 I'm outta pages
 New places, new faces
 New fans, all ages
 Black, pink, purple, orange,
 Caucasians
 Latinos European and
 Asian, Anabaenas'
 Knew all my lyrics, it was Amazing!
 They spoke Spanish...
 I guess its true what they say
 Music is the universal language
 It's a true blessing you know
 To travel the globe
 
 I'll play across the world
 
 Across the world
 I'll play across the world
 
 Across the world
 I'll play across the world
 
 Russia, it's a world wide
 You can catch me in Russia
 At a millionaire's night
 Nah I ain't no Russian
 But I get what I like
 Baby know Russian
 I'ma tell you what I want
 
 Girl it's on tonight
 You got me trippin off them strobe lights
 You know this vodka got me feeling right
 Just one more drink I take you home tonight
 And we can go from the bed to the floor
 From the window to the wall
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night
 From the bed to the floor
 From the window to the wall
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night
 
 So where you wanna go baby girl, no I don't care
 Any universe, any atmosphere
 Clock say 1:12 so we're outta here
 We can do it everywhere
 She throwing up dubs screaming west side
 I got a Cali king you can fit just right
 Pick cars depending on what's the best drive
 Give you the keys, let you test drive
 Top floor, with the sweet sounds great
 Looking out the window over the tristate
 She come mad early and leave mad late
 And I ain't eating at the table, don't need no plates
 Her clothes in the bedroom floor,
 We're not even in the bedroom no more
 I get a text message in the morn
 Like daddy, go ahead and to me like that tonight
 
 Girl it's on tonight
 You got me trippin' off them strobe lights
 You know this vodka got me feeling right
 Just one more drink I take you home tonight
 And we can go from the bed to the floor
 From the window to the wall
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night
 From the bed to the floor
 From the window to the wall
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night
 
 Baby we can go from the hallway to the backroom
 Go upstairs, back down soon
 My couch's soft, my floor too
 We can take a day if you want too
 Turn john like TV, HD, 3d
 I spin you around like a CD
 Baby don't make it so easy
 She won't let,
 She wrecking my place like Tasmanian devil
 I'm giving the base, she giving the treble
 And we turn it up, to the next level
 I told her we can do it when the sun's up
 Or we can get it in when the sun's down
 Or maybe we can meet halfway
 Either way, baby girl I'ma put it down
 
 Girl it's on tonight
 You got me trippin' off them strobe lights
 You know this vodka got me feeling right
 Just one more drink I take you home tonight
 And we can go from the bed to the floor
 From the window to the wall
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night
 From the bed to the floor
 From the window to the wall
 No matter where we are, we can do it all night.
 
 International sensation, you know
 And Mister Worldwide, dale!
 
 I'm like a quarterback, I got options
 But I played the point in school
 Broke ankles, more than a few
 Broke hearts, yeah, that too
 20 Years later, same movie, same script,
 Same player, more chips, more women, more haters
 Different toilet, same shh
 Why get caught up in the motions?
 Why go through the same emotions?
 In a sick way she love to see me mad
 It gets her wetter than the ocean
 She's a good girl gone bad
 But bad girls don't like good guys
 Now tell me if you think I'm a good guy
 That's what I thought huh let's ride
 
 All the things you do, all the things you say
 Playing with my heart so I can run away
 All the things you did,
 All the things you said to me said to me, said
 Now I'm lonely in my bed
 
 All the things you do, all the things you say
 Playing with my heart so I can run away
 All the things you did
 All the things you said to me said to me, said
 Now I'm lonely in my bed
 
 Woo!
 
 They act hard but they got soft hearts
 And I know they're soft spots
 I meet them, I greet them, I train them
 And show them all about hard knocks
 Listen, next thing you know next thing you know)
 They holding the fort down like Fort Knox 
 Then they fall in love and make everything seem what is not
 Damn, these are called rules of engagement
 Welcome to the world of entertainment
 They don't want a man like Reeman
 They want a man that's stuck in the remains
 I know it's ironic, but the good girls like bad guys
 Now tell me, do you think I'm a good guy?
 That's what I thought, now let's ride
 
 Woo!
 
 All the things you do, all the things you say
 Playing with my heart so I can run away
 All the things you did
 All the things you said to me said to me, said
 Now I'm lonely in my bed
 
 All the things you do, all the things you say
 Playing with my heart so I can run away
 All the things you did
 All the things you said to me said to me, said
 Now I'm lonely in my bed
 
 Woo!
 
 All the things you do, all the things you say
 Playing with my heart so I can run away
 All the things you did
 All the things you said to me said to me, said
 Now I'm lonely in my bed

 Back, ooh you groovy baby
 In, let's make a movie baby
 Time, excuse me baby
 Let's, yeah you baby
 Go, ooh you groovy baby
 Back in, let's make a movie baby, time
 
 It's Mr Worldwide, Agent A, Reporting live
 From Cape Canaveral, MK, Big Syphe, let's ride
 
 Back, back, in, in, time
 
 Baby, oh baby
 Oh baby, my sweet baby
 You're the one
 
 Miami equals black mask, black clothes
 With a little bit of rope to tie, I flipped it
 Black suits, white shirts, black glasses with a matching tie
 Like Agent J or Agent K, and I wish the whole world would
 OK, I'm tryin' make a billion out of 15 cents
 Understand, understood
 I'm a go-getter, mover, shaker, culture, bury a boarder, record-breaker won't cha
 Give credit where credit is due don't cha
 Know that I don't give a number two
 Y'all just halfway thoughts
 Not worth the back of my mind
 But to understand the future we have to go back in time
 
 Baby, oh baby
 Oh baby, my sweet baby
 You're the one
 
 I got the globe, yeah, in the palm of my hand
 Wherever I spin it, that's where I land
 Let's save the world
 Men In Black I know you understand
 Stop the movement, they can try if they want to
 Ignorar lo latino, si, they can try if they want to
 What Pit solves is a bit raw
 Took like jigsaw and built it all
 Despite a big loss, I'd bet it all
 And fought blind against the world, Ray Charles
 Y'all just halfway thoughts
 Not worth the back of my mind
 But to understand the future, we have to go back in time
 
 Baby, oh baby
 Oh baby, my sweet baby
 You're the one
 
 Let's excuse me baby
 Go, yeah you baby
 Back, ooh you groovy baby
 In, let's make a movie baby
 Time, excuse me baby
 Let's, yeah you baby
 Go, ooh you groovy baby
 Back in, let's make a movie baby, time
 
 Haters in the club 
 Gold Diggers 
 Broke niggaz 
 I suggest, I suggest that you 
 
 I'm in the cut in the club
 Scopin the scene
 Cup half way full
 Smokin the green
 She got her hand on my nuts
 What does that mean?
 Pointed at her friend
 And she said, they'll tag team
 Now who said dreams don't come true
 Its like I'm dreamin
 When I come through
 I always find something to run through
 Speak into the mike mami
 Mic check one two
 Drunk in the club
 Off the chain
 But who gives as fuck?
 That's why I came
 So pour it up
 And get down
 Ya'll have no choice
 But to listen to Pit now
 
 Put your ass in reverse baby 
 It don't involve money then 
 Dawg, get from me and 
 Everytime I fall I get right 
 
 Haters in the club 
 Gold diggers 
 Broke niggaz 
 I suggest, I suggest that you 
 
 Everybody knows
 Pit's got tight raps
 When I'm in the club
 DJs bring it back
 With no questions asked
 But the number one question is
 "Does he got cash?"
 Lil Jon's at the bar
 While me and them eastside boys smoke out
 Roll another one
 No doubt
 Get a couple hoes
 Roll out
 Beef, you don't want none
 To go down
 dumb diddy dumb dumb
 My times now
 The city I'm from
 Is covered with federals
 That'll make your crew run run
 Your crew run run
 Its next to come
 
 Put your ass in reverse baby 
 It don't involve money then 
 Dawg, get from me and 
 Everytime I fall I get right 
 
 Haters in the club 
 Gold diggers 
 Broke niggaz 
 I suggest, I suggest that you 
 
 I convince mami to creep on the DL
 Even though my head spinning
 Like some sprewells
 Skip the details
 Its the vodka bottom line
 that's testin my patience like doctors
 I'm not impressed by the cool shit
 Or those chains or that ice or them cars
 All that's bullshit
 If that's what your lookin for
 Keep lookin hoe
 Cause you got the wrong one bitch
 I'll let you know
 Mami's like damn
 That Cuban's shot out
 Bitch I came to the club
 To wild out
 If you came to act up
 Then you need to get from me bitch
 And back up
 
 Put your ass in reverse baby 
 It don't involve money then 
 Dawg, get from me and 
 Everytime I fall I get right 
 
 Put your ass in reverse baby 
 It don't involve money then 
 Dawg, get from me and 
 Everytime I fall I get right

 But like Jay say how sick am I, wish 'em health for sure
 But I'm cool with it, act a fool with it
 Went to one of my old neighborhoods and built a school in it
 It's crazy baby the way that the eighties made me
 I thank God every day that music saved me
 I thank my mom for all the vision she gave me
 I thank Miami for the way you raised me
 
 I'm a bad man, in an evil world
 
 And you're my type of goody two-shoes girl
 
 Baby I'm a bad man, in a woman's world
 
 Come on over, give me what I deserve

 It's been a while and you found somebody else
 They say you really doing good for yourself
 But I know you out there feeling so lonely

 Como se mueve sus panatalones blancos
 Se mueve, se mueve, se mueve con mambo

 I know y'all listen to my music  
 But what I'm a do know is try and describe my life to y'all
 
 Sometimes I fell like I'm loosing it 
 My life is upside down 
 A gift and a curse that's my life now 
 There is no looking or turning back 
 I used to watch coke turn to crack that's what made me turn to rap
 I fell like Keanu Reeves in the movie Devils Advocate 
 Confused but blessed with extravagance 
 I thank god for all the opportunities 
 Given the opportunity dem boys would put two in me 
 We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thieves 
 I made money now I got uncle Sam hustling 
 Me for a quarter of what I make 
 Hand a quarter sentence to a fake and watch them turn state 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Until the fed's step in  
 Most of these fools are characters 
 Men with no character welcome to America 
 Where we fight for freedom 
 If ain't about oil than we don't need them 
 Ain't that the truth? 
 Pitbull I'm just tell y'all the way I fell 
 Thank god that god made me to keep it real
 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Until the fed's step in 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Till that fame step in 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Till dem bitches step in 
 Blood is thicker than water 
 Till that money step in 
 
 Huh hun yo 
 After the turf war the smoke clears 
 All these years around these busta I'm convinced there ain't no hope here
 In the past four years of my lifetime 
 I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline
 Guess I'm chosen at the right time mama stress
 Facing the table and she's snorting up white line 
 Blood is thicker than water
 In a few cases your daughter can have touched for the money that in dem suit case 
 Tighten my shoelaces the fugitive running 
 In fear of a criminal past 'cause dem folks is coming 
 I've been wrongfully judged being from this environment 
 The city gangs planning retirement 
 I'm a a Dade nigga 
 Voicing my set 'cause a spray quick 
 Took some of the same steps through little Haiti 
 As these main nigga  hit man, big dog, and she hound 
 Y'all predict it back then shit I see it know
 
 I escape poverty  
 I don't own jewelry motherfucker I own property 
 You can send dem tsunamis that hit Indonesia  
 Ain't no motherfucking thing stopping me 
 Like good coke I'm a good swimmer 
 God knows I done lost but god dam I'm a good winner
 It feels great to make something out of nothing 
 Yea I'm humble but I tell y'all to push a chicos buttons 
 And watch how them thing get to dumping 
 Real estate New York game now you saying something 
 I only talk about what I know about 
 Illegal turn legal this year that's what I'm all about
 I'm from the south and I ain't gonna lie 
 At fist time I preach ye till god struck me with pride 
 I was confused now I'm like let's ride 
 Three o five till I die 
 Three o five till I die

 Till a nigga D-I-E, I be forever thuggin' baby! 
 The same nigga that's why the streets still love me baby! 
 Bitch I'm from Dade County. 
 See I'm a 7-Trey Chevrolet Impala dunk ridah. 
 I'll blow ya doors off. 
 You race your car 'gainst my car, 
 I'll leave your ass so far you'll doze off. 
 And when I take off, it's like I took off. 
 And when I ride by, it's like I fly by. 
 You like a slow motion. 
 All in 3-D. 
 'cause everywhere I go, they by like "there he go" 
 I fit the description, 
 Black Tee an dickies, big glock wit me, 
 Real Dade County Nigga! 
 
 It's that little chico Pitbull, 
 I'd just like to welcome y'all to where I been born, 
  
 I been raised
 In the County of Dade, you know? 
 You got them boys that pass by in them old school Chevy's wit the top downs, 
 Beats that, you know, make the trunk rattle, rear-views shake, 
 Then they look at you wit they golds in they mouth 
 Let you know what it is. 
 
 I been born and raised in the county of dade, 
 The land of the haze, the cocaine capitol. 
 We ain't just hittin' you buddy, we Warren Sapp'n ya. 
 We comin' hard like them Cubans in the 80's dog. 
 Go ahead, throw it in the pot I bet it's raw, 
 Pero ten cuidado con un tumbe porque se lo llevan todo 
 Llama al babalaow preguntale por un depojo 
 Pero tu no puedes con los lobos 
 Everything that I do, do, 
 Everything that I say, say, 
 Everywhere that I go I let 'em know hey I'm from the County of Dade! 
 Old school Chevy heavy, 
 Old school niggas preachin', 
 Young niggas wild'n gettin' rich of keys and violence. 
 Trick, he's the mayor. 
 Luke, he's the king. 
 I'm Mr. 305, put that on a triple-beam. 
 I bet it weigh out more than a boat load of keys, 
 Holla at them Haitians, let them know this licks on me. 
 What's up? Dade. 
 
 You see him. 
 You see him. 
 Ross. 
 You see him. 
 You see him. 
 Trick. 
 Pitbull. 
 DJ Khaled. 
 305 M-I-yayo. 
  
 
 I got road dogs doin' that 20-to-life, 
 You try me, and I'm a get 20 tonight. 
 You think your bitch bad, boy I got 20 alike, 
 Not the car but you know I be pushin' the white. 
 Dippin' Chevy in syrup, 
 Digital dash, 
 No bank accounts, 
 My money in bags. 
 Go do the physics, 
 Cause when I whip it, 
 And I love to whip it, 
 That's just another digit. 
 This is my city, in my city ya gotta tote fire. 
 Over town, they'll bust ya head 'cause it won't slide. 
 Brown sub will wet ya ass like a dunk ride. 
 You're dead wrong for thinkin' them chicos won't ride. 
 Opa Locka revolve around that big 4-5. 
 Them lil' Haitians they take ya ass for a boat ride., 
 In carol city, niggas quick to board the plane wit it, 
 Unpack the sack and kill the game wit it!  
 
 born and raised, born born and raised, born and raised in the county of Dade. 
 born born and raised, born born and raised, born born and raised in the county of Dade. 
 born and raised, born born and raised, born born and raised in the county of Dade. 
 born born and raised, born and raised, born and raised in the county of Dade. 
 
 Yeah it's DJ Khaled, do or die, 
 Big Dog Pitbull, 
 Terror Squad-ian, a.k.a the Beat Novacaine. 
 Rest in Peace to my dog Uncle Al!

 Baby don't think twice, let's ride it tonight

 Ape Drums, Steven Clark, and yours truly
 Mr. W.W.
 I told you once 
 I tell you twice 
 The grass looks greener on the other side
 'Til you get to the other side
 
 Well you're happy now
 And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so right
 Well then I guess we always
 Want what we can't have
 Why does loneliness hurt so bad
 And girl I want you back
 Well then I guess we always
 Want what we can't have
 
 Can't have
 Can't have
 Can't have
 Ohh!
 
 I see Central Park, from my hotel room
 And it's got me thinking
 'Bout the crazy things we use to do
 For the fame, for the power, for the fortune
 Ducked prison, ducked death, I'm fortunate
 It was all a dream, now I wake up and live it
 Thinking that the sky was the limit
 'Til I figured out there was footprints on the moon
 Now I'm like get out the way, bitch move
 
 Papo I'm live, fuck the other side
 I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
 Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
 Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
 I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
 Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
 Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
 Everyone wants what they can't have right?
 
 Well you're happy now
 And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so right
 Well then I guess we always
 Want what we can't have
 Why does loneliness hurt so bad
 And girl I want you back
 Well then I guess we always
 Want what we can't have
 
 Can't have, can't have
 Can't have, can't have
 Can't have, ohh!
 
 Looking at my backyard, now all I see the ocean
 Not bad for a kid that grew up with roaches
 Drama, chaos, and different coaches
 That's what allows me to see through these vultures
 First we shining shoes
 Then we own the shoe shop
 First we make the sandwich
 Then we own the restaurants
 First then we clean the house
 Then we own every house on the block
 Not bad for some immigrants
 
 Papo I'm live, fuck the other side
 I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
 Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
 Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
 I'm always gonna rep 305 'til I die
 Everyone knows that this chico gon' ride
 Now I won't kill you but I'll watch you die
 Everyone wants what they can't have right?
 
 Well you're happy now
 And I'm so glad, 'cause you're so right
 Well then I guess we always
 Want what we can't have
 Why does loneliness hurt so bad
 And girl I want you back
 Well then I guess we always
 Want what we can't have
 
 Can't have, can't have
 Can't have, can't have
 Can't have, ohh!
 
 But I guess we always want
 What we can't have
 
 Money got ya tongue tied
 Its a slow ride
 Up 'til your going down
 Funny how your friends lie
 Its a landslide
 When
 You
 Wear
 The crown
 Give it to me!
 
 Tell people that you sing on the radio 
 Same people you don't see on the radio 
 Tell people that you sing on the radio 
 Same people you don't see on the radio 
 
 They Said I couldn't do it but I did it
 Fought T-B-T beat the most attention.
 Met with all labels they ain't get it.
 Now I'm taken over
 Fuck who with it.
 Time ta get filthy rich
 Try ta stay not guilty bitch
 They said they used ta handle bricks
 I believe them when they projects are brick
 All they rap about is crack n coke
 Knowing they ain't never dealt crack or coke
 Yea its a joke
 But thanks 'cause I'm laughing all the way to the bank
 Ha ha
 
 Tell people that you sing on the radio 
 Same people you don't see on the radio 
 Tell people that you sing on the radio 
 Same people you don't see on the radio 
 
 It's not how you fall
 It's how you get back up, dog
 Struggle, hustle, fight, hard
 That's all I know is right, dog
 Blood of a king
 Heart of a lion
 
 They some wrinkled pussy boys
 Somene please pass me the iron 
 Death before dishonor
 That means for years I've been dying
 Stop your bloodclots crying
 I'm here to save Private Ryan
 
 Tell people that you sing on the radio 
 Same people you don't see on the radio 
 Tell people that you sing on the radio 
 Same people you don't see on the radio 
 Tell people that you sing on the radio 
 Same people you don't see on the radio 
 Tell people that you sing on the radio 
 Same people you don't see on the radio

 Twista:
 
 So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand
 When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
 Reach from my hand
 
 I sacrificed my life to give you my life to speakers
 I tried to do good even though I've been crossed like Jesus
 God knows I got a good heart but my blood's been with demons
 I'm fighting myself, believe me, I'm far from ignorant
 Far from greedy if you knew what I come from
 Knew what I've been through, you think there shoulda
 Been another outcome just like most kids
 A father, I did it without one
 Come from the city where they X you like Malcom
 Then you wonder how come I can move in the room
 Full of woos, so sweet, so smooth
 Thank you mom for making me a man
 Let 'em mother fucker knock down my castle in the sand
 
 So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand
 When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
 Reach from my hand
 
 Reach for my hand
 
 I live my whole life with the world on my shoulders
 So I couldn't care less what this music game throws us
 I see them looking in front of ? , but they won't find it
 I come from struggle, I am a fighter, must you be reminded
 My mother's past has a trap, has a blinded
 But I took her past, I took her pain
 I made it strength, I fought the game,
 Do or die, Pitbull's the name
 Now all I see is the future, mom, I love you, I salute you
 Then no matter what happens jusst you're the reason I am rappin'
 
 Look I'm from the home where the spit is the wind is the big apple
 Came down to south beach to build a new castle
 Every day I'm hustling and every day you hassle
 Doing what you can and I'm doing what I have to
 Throw me in the jungle and I'll show you I'm a winner
 I'm coming out with dinner and wearing a chinchilla
 I did it for my town to show 'em the big picture
 Kid hit the switch, I promise to never switch up
 This is for my brother took three and went to jail
 I'm sending all my pictures through the mail
 He hit me with a letter, I know you'll never fail
 So put me on the beach with a bucket and a pail
 
 So you tried to believe in the castles made of sand
 When it falls to the sea and your feet can't find dry land
 Reach from my hand
 
 Reach for my hand
 
 Mr. Worldwide

 Tonight we're making history

 We've been around the world, same song
 Work hard, play hard, all day long
 All the continents get jealous over me
 You can see me 3D overseas
 If you know me then you know where to find me
 Off in the Bahamas with a bad one behind me
 Now live it up, live it up, live it up

 And it's not our fault that we have all the ladies
 But it's hard to see these ladies when your middle name's Equator
 All around the globe, matter fact see your later

 They dont call me Mr. 3-0-5 for nothing.
 I earned that shit!
 Dale!
 Who ow!
 
 I don't mess with the smack
 I don't mess with the blow
 I don't mess with the crack
 Not me, no mo'
 Wanna ? holla at a Latin broad 
 And if you tryna get that money, buddy 
 
 Y'all can play, thugs and gangstas while I
 Get this money with these lords and bankers
 I was, watching Scarface dreaming of becoming Tony,
 Schemin', Triple beamin', double teamin' bitches with my homies
 I got no blame its just some bitches understand my story
 And anger problems, my brother usually wont hear before me
 Rap had me, wanting to be a dope boy
 Now I rap, I stay away from that dope, boy
 It's destiny, I was breast fed that coke boy
 And when you seem them chicos better call them folks boy
 I'm putting ya'll on the game
 I'm hearing raps about coke and crack 
 To be honest they all sound the same
 Pit is off the chain 
 Yea, That's set in stone 
 So leave him alone 
 Boy, leave him alone
 Pit's reporting live 
 From D-A-D-E
 Gotta problem buddy?
 Come see me!
 
 I don't mess with the smack
 I don't mess with the blow
 I don't mess with the crack
 Not me, no mo'
 Wanna ? holla at a Latin broad 
 And if you tryna get that money, buddy 
 
 I don't mess with the smack
 I don't mess with the blow
 I don't mess with the crack
 Not me, no mo'
 Wanna ? holla at a Latin broad 
 And if you tryna get that money, buddy 
 
 Fuck who's the baddest a person's status depends on salary
 This for them Cuban's losing life over Fidel's mentality
 Treat a hater like golf and put a hole in one
 I don't carry guns but my dog's holdin' one
 Y'all boys flip bricks, These boys flip tons
 One time Fat Joe, Rest In Peace Big Pun
 This how I do it do it
 Spit English and Spanish fluent
 Then if you don't know I suggest
 You pay close attention to it
 Pit's here now
 This how it's going down
 Kilos and pounds
 Goin' town to town
 Fortunately that's not my life no mo'
 If its gotta do with dope
 For me its a no go
 Pit's one of a kind
 Pit's ahead of his time
 I'm nowhere near my prime
 I'm always on the grind
 I'm reporting live
 From D-A-D-E
 Gotta problem buddy?
 Come see me!
 
 I don't mess with the smack
 I don't mess with the blow

 Ella no 'ta enamora' de mi , yo tampoco
 Pero le gusta como yo le doy 
 Yo la pongo a volar cuando yo le doy besos
 Pero no 'ta enamora' de mi
 
 She said she's not in love with me, no! no!
 But she loves how I give it to her, yes! yes! sexy!
 And I blow her mind
 Every time that I kiss her
 But she said she's not in love with me
 Yeah right
 Ella siempre me llama a las 3 de la ma'ana
 Dice que soy su pana
 El que le quita las ganas
 Y si ella supiera que me llama su hermana
 Porque tambien soy su pana
 El que te quita las ganas
 
 Who the hell is this?
 Texting me at 3:46
 It must be a trick
 And if she texting me at this time
 She's looking for a Richard
 Or should I say Dick
 
 Mami yo te doy pao! pao!
 Ella dice que yo soy mal hablao
 No mamita yo no soy mal hablao
 Que yo te hablo directo de Miami al Cibao
 So deja el papelazo
 Para los turistas y los payasos
 H'blame claro que tu sabes bien
 Que te gusta lo malo

 Yo te doy caramelo
 Pero deja los celos
 Ella dice que no esta enamorada de mi
 Eso me conviene
 Don Miguelo

 Casi siempre me llama a las 3 de la ma'ana
 Dice que soy su pana
 El que te quita las ganas
 Yo nunca la dejo a medias
 Tu entiende el drama
 Dice que soy su pana
 El que te quita las ganas
 Hemos hecho de to'
 Muchas posiciones en la escalera
 Amarrao en la cama
 Yo encima de ella
 Amanecimos en la ba'era
 Y me la com' embarra de nutella
 Son requisitos que otros no nan usado
 Y ella solo dice wow!
 Lo que yo hago nunca se ha inventado
 Porque ni el kamasutra
 Se lo ha inventado oiga!
 
 Ella no ta' enamora' de mi no! no!
 Pero le gusta como yo le doy, si! si!
 Yo la pongo a volar
 Cuando yo le doy besos
 Pero no ta' enamora' de mi no! no!
 
 She said she's not in love with me, no! no!

 This is for all the women
 That have been stripped of their innocence
 
 But no matter what,
 They kept their head up,
 And this is my way of saying thank you.
 
 Confused, and don't know what to think,
 Cause she thought that she was
 
 Confused, and don't know what to think,
 Cause she thought that she was
 
 To find for herself cause she thought that she was,
 
 She thought that she was,
 She was daddy's little girl
 
 She was daddy's little girl
 
 I was raised by women,
 A women made me a man,
 Its just to bad that a man,
 Took her innocence.
 And god knows that I,
 I would finish him,
 Diminish him,
 End up killing him.
 Blame it on the ignorance,
 That's where her childhood went,
 New country,
 New language,
 That's how seven years were spent.
 Time you can't buy it,
 And some lose 'em here
 I know that we bumped heads,
 Just know mum that I'm here.
 
 Cuba peter pan,
 The rebelution was crazy,
 I wanna thank you mom,
 For the way you raised me,
 All your life you wanted
 Only one thing,
 And that was to say
 
 Confused, and don't know what to think,
 Cause she thought that she was
 
 Confused, and don't know what to think,
 Cause she thought that she was
 
 To fight for herself cause she thought that she was,
 
 She thought that she was,
 She was daddy's little girl
 
 She was daddy's little girl
 
 Took care of me,
 Just like a mother,
 Till you got pregnant,
 Then you was off to Georgia,
 It was tough how we,
 How we were brought up,
 Tougher for you,
 Cause you had no father,
 Now I understand,
 Now that I'm a man,
 How much a woman needs,
 Someone to call dad,
 You cut through the pain,
 You walked through the rain,
 The game ain't playin' you,
 Baby you play the game.
 Now your in search of,
 That father figure,
 And if you find him,
 He denies you,
 Jenny fuck that nigga,
 Karmas a bitch,
 Even though I know she wish
 
 Confused, and don't know what to think,
 Cause she thought that she was
 
 Confused, and don't know what to think,
 Cause she thought that she was
 
 To find for herself cause she thought that she was,
 
 She thought that she was,
 She was daddy's little girl
 
 She was daddy's little girl
 
 This is for all the women that stayed strong,
 And beat all the odds
 
 The ones that have been raped,
 The ones that grew up fatherless
 
 Oh ho
 But still found a way to raise their kids,
 To do the right thing
 
 This is for y'all,
 I love y'all
 
 Dammit man , D-D-Dammit man
  D-D-Dammit man, D-D-Dammit man
 Dammit man , D-D-Dammit man
  D-D-Dammit man, D-D-Dammit man
 
 When you see dem boys 'round your way, holla dammit man!
 
 When you see dem boys 'round your way, holla dammit man!
 
 When you see dem boys 'round your way, holla dammit man!
 
 When you see dem boys 'round your way, holla dammit man!
 
 Y'all really can't fuck with us
 
 Y'all really can't fuck with us
 
 Y'all really can't fuck with us
 
 Y'all really can't fuck with us
 Y'all really can't fuck with us
 
 I'm a kill 'em in the club with this one
 I'm a tear the club the fuck up
 I'm a have 'em goin' to war over this one
 Partna, just listen
 If you don't want those things to click-clack
 Take a few steps back
 Because I'm playin fo' keeps, go ahead keep playin with me
 And watch how I hit 'em in the head once again
 For those who didn't believe in the kid
 Y'all might as well be dead
 Because what y'all thought couldn't be done, I did
 I'm like ray charles dawg, I don't see none of y'all
 I'm blind to the fact that half of y'all rap,
 And I'm outrunnin y'all
 When I hit 'em from the back
 I got them mami's saying dammit man
 When I put it in they mouth
 I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh 
 When I hit 'em from the back
 I got them mami's saying dammit man
 When I put it in they mouth
 I got them mami's saying duh-huh-huh-muhh
 Put that up dammit
 But me and you both know that these niggas ain't ready
 They're just too petty, I'm just too deadly 
 
 Pitbull's that underrated, underdog, killin' the underground
 But that's just an understatement
 It's hard to understand why I'm still underpaid
 Just look in my blue eyes and see the hunger and pain,
 Dammit man
 But I don't plan it man,
 Because I do what I want to do, move what I want to move
 Y'all gonna see what I mean when I live out my dreams
 I'ma tell you like biggie told me,
 Cash rules everything around me
 I could give a fuck about what you say about me
 Cause when those things get pulled
 Out and squeezed, they'll spray about three
 Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up,
 Give it up, that's how it goes
 Pit's gon spit it up, flip it up, rip it up,
 But I'm a pro 
 Hit 'em up, wet 'em up, get 'em up, give it up, that's how it goes
 Pit's gon spit it up, flip it up, rip it up,
 But I'm a pro 
 So all ya'll amateur ass niggas do-don't try to sit home
 Pit's co-co-comin, runnin gunnin' fo-fo that throne
 
 Y'all really can't fuck with us
 
 Y'all really can't fuck with us
 
 Y'all really can't fuck with us
 
 Y'all really can't fuck with us
 Y'all really can't fuck with us
 
 I got the hat, I got the shoes, I got the outfit
 I go outside and pick the right I'm goin' go out with
 But right before I hit the streets 
 I gotta put on my dancing shoes in the mirror
 
 The hat, rock with it, rock with it
 The hat, step with it, step with it
 The hat, slide with it, slide with it
 The hat, ride with it, ride with it
 The hat, walk with it, walk with it
 The hat, get low 
 The hat, and I know where I'm 'bout to go
 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Don't be tricky with me 
 Sorry I was in the corner, now she's looking for me

 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm tricking with you

 Mr. Dizm 'bout to blow a nigga pants off 
 So if he wanna ride with me 
 I'm 'bout to do the same thing that I be in the mirror

 From the grill to the paint to the dog in the back to the jump off
 And if he's not gonna set it off, hit the club
 And who's step up to my crew, then this is what my crew goin' do my nigga
 
 The hat, rock with it, rock with it
 The hat, step with it, step with it
 The hat, slide with it, slide with it
 The hat, ride with it, ride with it
 The hat, walk with it, walk with it
 The hat, get low 
 The hat, and I know where I'm 'bout to go

 Khaled check this out right.
 I know we global now, world wide 305.
 But I see that they are trying to bring down the movement.
 I'm telling everybody in the crib they can bet on me.
 One time, new Diaz. 
 
 Put your money where your mouth is, bet on me. 
 
 Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,
 I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 
 Tell them boys to keep running that shit out they mouth,
 I'm the guard of my city, can't knock me down like
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 
 You're back won't last with checks you cant cash.
 
 Keep disrespecting, in the the everglades they'll find ya,
 I'm not from San Fransisco, but the chopper of forty ninya.
 I grew up listening to Lou, and, and, and pumping Trick
 Them boys done open doors, so respect is owed.
 I got love for Rick, and congrats you made it,
 I was a fan from the mix tape you sold me at Foxy Ladies.
 I seen them trying to bring you down, but f**k that dog you one of the greatest!
 Khaled mix 96er, but even back then though you had haters.
 I remember the Temple at Oynx, I was too drunk to get in,
 I was still outsider selling Chronic you know gettin it in.
 I remember Ump beating the rape mistrial, celebrating the win.
 Yall can try to stop Miami but this shit will never end.
 
 One time TS, two times Fat Joe.
 I remember them boys in Wynnwood hood stack short.
 I remember them Cash Money Boys in Little Haiti, all running with zozs.
 Banana Azuri, soft drop top that's for sure.
 Flo Rida, Groundhogs always show love before.
 Dammit been paying dues, now its my time to blow.
 Even when 50 come through, he don't roll no less than 50 zozs!
 Cause they will push your shit back, way back to trues and vows.
 My dog Nose shaker, come through the block on something clean.
 Sounding like an earthquake, he is what these dope boys dream.
 Hit a lick, flip a brick, snatch a Brinks truck.
 That's them Miami boys don't get it mixed up.
 
 I'm Mr. 305, I'm a part of Miami's Heat.
 I grew up in all types of neighborhoods, I am Miami's street.
 Low key and stay quiet, that's how these chicos in Miami eat.
 I love it when these boys come from out of town and thinking Miamis sweet.
 All of them down looking for pussy , trying to Miami skeet.
 That's when they run up in they hotel room and give them a Miami treat.
 When the choppers start a raining, its hard to stop a Miami leak.
 That's what they get for thinking Miamis just Miami Beach.
 
 Ha, You know how this ain't a neighborhood right?
 Don't let your mouth write a check your ass can't cash
 If the moneys on the wood, its all good.
 But if the moneys out of sight it going to be a fight.
 And the last thing you want is a fight with the 305,

 Las mujeres no son las unicas que tienen sentimientos 
 Mamita te voy a hablar claro 
 Yo me siento mal, muy mal 
 Ken-Y, explicales 
 
 Ayer me dijistes que me amabas 
 Que no habria quien nos separara 
 Que yo era tuyo y tu eras mia 
 Para nuestro amor no habian medidas 
 Pero de repente todo cambio 
 Ya no eras la misma cuando haciamos el amor 
 Hoy me pides que me vaya sin ninguna razon 
 Tu no sabes cuanto daao le hace a mi corazon, perderte 
 
 Dime como olvidarte 
 Si no quiero alejarme 
 No me pidas que me vaya, no

 No me pidas que me vaya, no 
  
 
 Yo te quiero con todo mi corazon 
 Pero no entiendo la razon 
 Porque siento como tu y yo no somos lo mismo, a lo mejor 
 Estamos acostumbrao' 
 Y no estamos enamorao' 
 O maybe es algo que da duro 
 Y viene y se va como un morao 
 Pero mami let's work it out 
 Es un daao profundo 
 Pensar en los aaos 
 Que tu y yo viviamos juntos 
 Y que, todos esos aaos se fueron por gusto? 
 No me digas eso mami 
 Eso yo no lo puedo aceptar 
 Un amor como el nuestro es real 
 Un amor tan profundo 
 Yo te apuesto el mundo 
 Que tu te sientes igual 
 Un amor que no se puede olvidar 
 Un amor que no se puede ocultar 
 Un amor tan rico y tan fuerte 
 Que no se puede dudar 
 
 Dime como olvidarte

 No me pidas que me vaya, no 
  
   
 Que no ves que ya no puedo

 Creo que merezco una, explicacion 
 Creeme, he tratado de olvidarte 
 Y lo unico que he logrado es recordarte 
 Dime, como aguantar tanto dolor 
  
 
 Dime como olvidarte

 Hazme el favor y escuchame mamita)

 So get ready mothafuckaz, this is not a game!!  
 
   
 I'm from the dirty dirty, where a lot of these cats mix the weed 
 With the coke and blow dirty, we're off the chain meng 
 Rap game, crack game, cut it, cook it, chop it, record it 
 Album shop it, its all the same thang 
 Y'all look at these blue skies and think paradise 
 I look at these blue skies, and think what a disguise 
 That's why its called the "Magic City", it's a treat to your eyes 
 Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind 
 Word of advice don't follow the streets, follow the signs 
 'cause the last thing you wanna do is get lost, cause it might just cost ya life 
 Y'all heard about the smash-&-grabs 
 So watch where you put the map on the dash 
 Cause they might end up clapping ya ass 
 Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night 
 They don't want you to stop cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes 
 Like Jamaican beer, we fry 'em like bacon here 
 Yo life'll get taken here, I just thought I should make it clear! Yeah!! 
 
  
 Everything we do is dirty!!!! 
 We pull up in the drop, it's dirty!! 
 We pound that twat, dirty!! 
 Miami!!!, we're dirty! 
 Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty! 
 Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty! 
  
 
   
 Straight up outta Texas, the reckless, PA to be exact 
 Where the streets is cutthroat and fiends kill you for a G of crack 
 8 g's and cadillacs, chevys cut on the deltas 
 Might swang up on ya then hurt ya, nobody here gon help ya 
 2000 heltah skelta, talking bout families and killers 
 Vicious like silver-back guerillas see then peel ya 
 Niggaz down here ain't tryna feel ya, see ya, hear ya, know ya 
 Serve ya, for ya or for ya  
 You pussy niggaz been hatin on us for too long 
 So we finna prove you wrong, teach you hoes a new song  
 'cause the time is now , the place is here  
 I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear 
 Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes 
 So that when everything go down, it won't be no kind of surprise 
 And I got no time for yo lies , save 'em for peter 
 Just remember my name, I'm facing my heater , let's get it dirty! 
 
  
 Everything we do is dirty!!!! 
 We pull up in the drop, it's dirty!! 
 We pound that twat, dirty!! 
 Miami!!!, we're dirty! 
 Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty! 
 Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty! 
  
 
   
 These boys from the bottom are obsessed with old school chevys 
 We call 'em verts and donks, some we call box chevys 
 Seven-duece, seven-trey, seven-four, seven-five 
 M-I-A-M-I till I die, 3-0-5!!! 
 Candy paint and leather, they don't fuck wit nothing but dubs or better 
 Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers 
 'cause when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters 
 This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors 
 So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches 
 And niggaz cocaine cooking brick flipping bitches trippin for figures 
 This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it 
 That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it 
 This is for everybody in county, TGK, Metro West and Stockade 
 Doing time 
 And if you got more than 365 
 And you're up the road rep MIA with pride, That's right!!! 
 
  
 Everything we do is dirty!!!! 
 We pull up in the drop, it's dirty!! 
 We pound that twat, dirty!! 
 Miami!!!, we're dirty! 
 Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty! 
 Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, they make 'em dirty! 
 
 Ooh I got a new one for ya
 I like the way that sounds 
 I'm `bout to do it for ya
 I like to break it down 
 This joint has got me open
 Uh that's my favorite song 
 I put my thing in motion 
 I do it all night long 
 
 You know the resume
 Call it what you want, boy as it may
 Not from the bay but hella paid
 Every day above ground is a good day so I celebrate
 Mami got that bubble-yum booty
 I wanna run through it like Rudy
 She said "do you own Nike?"
 I said "not yet", she said "then just do it"
 Fresh at the Grammy's in a tuxedo
 Play about 18 holes on any given day
 Tiger Woods steelo, yea I get around but only on the D low
 Now I'm changing the world
 Just to think I used to dream about kilos
 Bank account used to be negative
 Now it's like that thing on reload, do it
 
 I got a new one for ya
 I like the way that sounds
 I'm `bout to do it for ya
 I like to break it down
 This joint has got me open
 Ooh that's my favorite song
 I put my thing in motion
 I do it all night long
 
 Do it, do it, do it
 Oh, here I go again
  Do it
 Do it
 Do it
  Do it
  Do it
  Do it
  Do it
 
 They want just never heard before,
 Never seen before, never worn before
 But if they only knew everything's been done before
 I'm half of an outcast like Love Below
 Instagram, now they take pics
 When I was growing up Instagram was a nick
 Man what a trippin'
 Bogota, Medellin, Colombia
 Man what a trip
 If you been there
 Then you know what I'm talkin' bout
 I'm runnin' through the world, y'all walk it out
 It's a marathon, not a sprint
 Long term, that's how I think
 My life could've turned out ugly
 I'm talkin' ugly, generino
 But I turned it all around and hit the jackpot
 De Niro, Casino, dale woo!
 
 I got a new one for ya
 I like the way that sounds
 I'm `bout to do it for ya
 I like to break it down
 This joint has got me open
 Ooh that's my favorite song
 I put my thing in motion
 I do it all night long
 
 Do it, do it, do it
 Oh, here I go again
  Do it
 Do it
 Do it

 Been working hard and now the weekend is here

 Show me what you got 
 Light one, put it in the atmosphere
 Give it yo best shot
 Show me what you got
 I got that lightning feeling from my head to my toes
 Give it your best shot
 Show me what you got

 Ladies and gentlemen, I like to introduce you all to a new game.
 It's called Dope Ball.
 Similar rules and regulations, but at the same time very different.
 
 Goes a lil' something like this.
 
 It's not pick 'n roll, it's more like pick a roll.
 What you gon' push? We waste a blow.
 If it's all three, then that's the three from the top of the key, before you cup a brick, scrape some grams of the top of the key.
 Same for the blow, we call those free throws, they call 'm cheerleaders, we call 'm cheap ho's.
 Find some low ones, have them beg a few O's.
 Next thing you know you're putting numbers on the... boat.
 The whole point is to stay on the courts, but, in this game the whole point is to stay outta courts.
 Yeah they similar, but not the same sports.
 Both international, import, export.
 Extort, and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought. Extort, and if you get caught, the law is like referee, it can get bought.
 
 Dope Ball, Dope Ball, we play, we play, we playing, Dope Ball, Dope Ball.
 This is called what? Dope Ball, Dope Ball!
 I know y'all later, if you push weighter, you see a Dope Ball!
 
 It's Mr Worldwide
 With the J to the L 
 Jenny let me talk to 'em
 
 If you think its a joke, go head and laugh
 Created my own lane, created my path
 Graduated at high school just not with my class
 I'm like Einstein, I created my math
 Hated algebra, but I loved to multiply
 So I took my letters and made 'em numbers right
 Will you evaluate, Jennifer baby let's celebrate
 
 I done had a long week
 Now its time to celebrate
 I done had a long week
 Now its time to celebrate
 This drink is for you
 This drink is for you
 
 This is for my singles ladies and single mothers
 Raising babies working hard
 I know the feeling, I used to live it
 My mother worked two to three jobs
 That's what this song is dedicated
 To all the women out there motivated
 Always finding ways to make ends meet
 All my women out there innovative
 You name the game, and they've played it
 They've heard all the stories, so save it
 All my women with power meet me at happy hour
 Let's celebrate
 
 I done had a long week
 Now its time to celebrate
 I done had a long week
 Now its time to celebrate
 I done had a long week
 Now its time to celebrate
 I done had a long week
 Now its time to celebrate
 This drink is for you
 This drink is for you
 
 I see you baby getting your hair done getting your nails tight
 I see you baby trying on different outfits
 Making sure they fit right
 I see you baby getting ready for the night
 Making sure you look right
 I see you baby I see you baby
 
 You cant stop the beat

 Get up on your feet, let's go

 Drop that beat, 
 Its the truth.
 You don't know what you have until you lose it.
 
 I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life.
 I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life.
 I've had my ups, my downs,I paid my dues.
 Learn my stride?
 Love for the passion......?
 
 All I know is the hustle and grind.
 All you want is some quality time.
 I can't give it to you due to the life that I choose.
 My heart is so close to the point my blood had froze.
 I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time.
 But then again time is money and I need mine.
 There I go again being selfish, 
 And there you go again the love and helpless.
 You mean the world to me baby you know its the truth.
 But I don't know who I love more you or the booth.
 These are just the things I need to get off my chest.
 Sometimes I feel like all I can give you is sex.
 I'm sorry
 
 I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life.
 I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life.
 I've had my ups, my downs,I paid my dues.
 Learned my stripes.
 Love........?
 
 I ain't gone lie, baby this life is addicting.
 The fame, the money, ecspecially these bitches.
 I've been around it all, I've seen them ball.
 Seen them fall, go broke and lose it all.
 That's why I work hard, 365.
 24-7, baby that's my life.
 I bleed, I feed, I sleep,I shit this.
 I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list.
 I know its hard to understand, 
 But its outta my hands, 
 This is God's plan.
 I came, I saw, I conquered.
 I apoligise, but this game is a monster.
 
 I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life.
 I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life.
 I've had my ups, my downs,I paid my dues.
 Learned my stripes.
 Love.......?

 I guarantee you can do that
 Or you can teach me like a thing or two
 But I bet you I already knew that
 So one night one time baby girl
 Let's take this chance
 We ain't trying to be love strung
 But I know that
 
 I know you don't do these type of things on the first night
 We both know it's wrong but fuck it cause it feels right

 Ask for money, and get advice
 Ask for advice, get money twice
 I'm from the Dirty, but that chico nice
 Y'all call it a moment, I call it life
 
 One day when the light is glowing
 I'll be in my castle golden
 But until the gates are open
 I just wanna feel this moment 
 
 I just wanna feel this moment 
 
 I just wanna feel this moment
 
 Mr Worldwide
 Christina Aguilera
 Oye mamita, come on, dale, que la cosa esta rica
 
 Feel this moment
 
 Reporting live, from the tallest building in Tokyo
 Long ways from them hard ways
 Bill sos, and oh yeas
 Dade County, always, 305 all day
 Now baby we can parle, oh baby we can party
 She read books, especially about red rooms and tie ups
 I got her hooked, 'cause she seen me in a suit with the red tie tied up
 Meet and greet, nice to meet ya, but time is money
 Only difference is I own it, now let's stop time and enjoy this moment
 
 One day when the light is glowing
 I'll be in my castle golden
 But until the gates are open
 I just wanna feel this moment 
 
 I just wanna feel this moment 
 
 I just wanna feel this moment
 
 Feel this moment
 
 I see the future but live for the moment, make sense don't it
 Now make dollars, I mean billions, I'm a genius, I mean brilliant
 The streets is what schooled 'em
 And made 'em slicker than Slick Rick the Ruler
 I've lost a lot, and learned a lot
 But I'm still undefeated like Shooter
 I'm far from cheap, I break down companies with all my peeps
 Baby we can travel the world
 And I can give you an all you can see
 Time is money
 Only difference is I own it, like a stop watch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment
 
 One day when the light is glowing
 I'll be in my castle golden
 But until the gates are open
 I just wanna feel this moment 
 
 I just wanna feel this moment 
 
 I just wanna feel this moment
 
 Come one, feel this moment
 
  I just wanna feel this moment
  I just wanna feel this moment

 Yo no juego juegos
 Lo unico que tengo es mi palabra why los dos huevos

 Este cubanito no es Willy Chrino
 Pero ya el llego, llego

 And tonight, let's enjoy life
 Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, tell us right
 
 Tonight I want all of you tonight
 Give me everything tonight
 For all we know we might not get tomorrow

 Don't care what they say
 All the games they play
 Nothing is enough
 'Til they handle love 
 
 I want you tonight
 I want you to stay
 I want you tonight
 
 Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
 Give me everything tonight
 Give me everything tonight
 Give me everything tonight
 Give me everything tonight
 
 Take advantage of tonight
 'Cause tomorrow I'm also doin' bad
 Perform for a princess
 But tonight, I can make you my queen
 And make love to you endless
 This is insane the way the name growin'
 Money keep flowin'
 Hustlers move aside
 So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'
 I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan
 
 Put it on my life, baby
 I make you feel right, baby
 Can't promise tomorrow
 But, I promise tonight, dale
 
 Excuse me
 And I might drink a little more than I should tonight
 And I might take you home with me, if I could tonight
 And, baby, I'ma make you feel so good, tonight
 'Cause we might not get tomorrow
 
 Tonight I want all of you tonight
 Give me everything tonight
 For all we know we might not get tomorrow
 Let's do it tonight
 
 Don't care what they say
 Or what games they play
 Nothing is enough
 'Til they handle love 
 
 I want you tonight
 I want you to stay
 I want you tonight
 
 Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey
 Give me everything tonight
 Give me everything tonight
 Give me everything tonight
 Give me everything tonight
 
 Reach for the stars
 And if you don't grab 'em,
 At least you'll fall on top of the world
 Think about it 'cause if you slip
 I'm gon' fall on top yo girl 
 
 What I'm involved with
 Is deeper than the mazes
 Baby, baby, and it ain't no secret
 My grammy's from Cuba
 But I'm an American
 And I don't get money like Seacrest
 
 Put it on my life, baby
 I make you feel right, baby
 Can't promise tomorrow
 But, I promise tonight, dale
 
 Excuse me
 But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight
 And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
 And baby I'ma make you feel so good tonight
 'Cause we might not get tomorrow
 
 Tonight I want all of you tonight
 Give me everything tonight
 For all we know, we might not get tomorrow

 Fuck that club 
 They want that thug 
 But I ain't no thug, bitch
 And I ain't no gangsta, bitch
 I'm a hustler, ho
 And I got no problem
 If you want it you can get it, boy I bust you
 
 Anybody wanna test? Hi, who? Me
 P-I to the motherfuckin' T
 It's not my fault that your bitch chose me, now her and her girlfriend wanna do me
 This is for those boys in those Chevys sittin' on them King James, them 2-3s
 And if you got a problem with me, holla at my lawyer, bitch, sue me
 I'm tired of the fuck-boy rap, fuck-boy this, fuck-boy that
 Watch a couple movies and they put it in they rhyme, those wanna be fiddlers
 I'm straight, you get shot 9 times
 10 years in the game, since 99, I was speakin' my mind 
 And then shit changed, if you got a problem, bitch cross that kinda line
 
 I'ma give em what they ask for
 What they want, that street talk
 I'ma give em what they ask for
 What they want, that chopper talk
 I'ma give em what they ask for
 What they want, that dope talk
 I'ma give em what they ask for,
 That trap-boy jackboy shit
 
 Pitbull Give Them What They Ask For lyrics found on http:www.directlyrics.com/pitbull-give-them-what-they-ask-for-lyrics.html
 I'ma tell y'all boy, y'all boys got me fucked up 
 Better duck when them things buck, I ain't nigga boy, nigga what, nigga who, who the fuck is you?
 Talkin to me like you know me
 Ain't your dog, ain't your buddy, ain't your homie
 Nah brah not me, and if you spit it better live it, better in fact, better show me
 I'ma make em say UHHH, not even Master P could crack like this
 And you ain't never seen a chico in the gang this raw since pawn that could rap like this 
 I hear them and they raps about the coke and the crack and the click to the clack, but to me it's chit chat
 Blam! Motherfucker take that, now!
 
 I'ma spit it, flip it, rip it for them boys
 Makin digits off the coke when they whip it
 Ride a stick, double clip it
 One mississippi, two mississippi, three mississipi, cock back, click it, blam!
 Poppin what you think is last, what you wanna do is get found in a trunk in a lake and stankin'
 I took my money from the shoebox, now I bank it
 Foolish, ain't it?
 
 Fuck that club 
 They want that thug 
 But I ain't no thug, bitch
 And I ain't no gangsta, bitch
 I'm a hustler, ho
 And I got no problem
 If you want it you can get it 'fo I bust you
 
 Up in this a new million
 You heard me, Sensato
 It's Mr. Worldwide
 Y El mundo helpatio
 Let my dreams yall dormant
 Category 6's are stormin'
 Take this as a, take this as a warning
 Welcome to, welcome to global warming
 
 I'm tired of this rap shit 'cause all they do is rap shit
 About coke shit, crack shit, click clack shit
 But they never sold coke crack or click clack shit
 That's why I'm laughing to the bang, ha-ha bitch
 Private jets, I'm on that mile high shit
 Without Denver, I'm going to November
 Earth, wind, fire, I'm all for September
 George Lopez puto, you remember
 Now I'm stalked by bankers and lenders
 Fuck these fake sugar ass niggas Splenda
 I see your game, your plan, your agenda
 They'll push your shit way back to Nintendo
 No Facebook, Twitter or Instagram
 I do it for the paper, I'm a business man
 If you get it that's cool
 It's all about the billionaires baby, welcome to the new school
 
 Al banco voy a abrirle una cuenta
 Pa' meterle miles miles y matarile
 I get's money, en mi bloque hay misiles
 Hay que comprarle chemises y zapatos bien reptiles
 It's all about them billionaires
 I'm so fucking serious
 Look, I love them zeros, they looking like Cheerios
 Monty like her period, y'all niggas gotta hurry up
 My team is in your area, regando la epidemia
 Tengo una novia Albania, blanquita macademia
 Estoy enfermo de leucemia
 Yall bronkers got anemia
 So if you get it that's cool
 It's all about them billionaires baby
 Welcome to the new school

 Mr. Worldwide
 Ellos quieren vivir la vida m'a, pero no pueden
 Nice try
 
 Saca tu cuerpo a bailar
 Y no pares de sudar
 Alza tus manos al viento, oh, oh, oh
 Y que no pare la fiesta
 Siguen hasta que amanezca
 Alza tus manos al viento
 Tus manos al viento, oh
 Tus manos al viento, oh
 
 Ricky Martin, Armandito
 Pa' arriba Cuba
 Pa' arriba Puerto Rico
 Pa' arriba todo el mundo
 Que llego pues loquito
 Como una pila jeva
 Ay, papito
 
 Yo traigo el rollie
 Tu tr'as el cokito
 Y ya estamos listo
 Pa'lante que brincan y salten
 nosotros brillando como los diamantes
 Directo y al punto
 Vamos a viajar el mundo, juntos
 Tu y yo mamita, que tu sabe que t' est's rica
 
 Tu y yo
 Sin querer perdimos el control
 Y no qued' m's remedio
 Que perdemos en la habitaci'n
 Saca tu cuerpo a bailar
 Y no pares a sudar
 Alza tus manos al viento, oh, oh, oh
 Y que no pare la fiesta
 S'gueme hasta que amanezca
 Alzar tus manos al viento
 Tus manos al viento, oh
 Tus manos al viento, oh
 Estas haciendo ruido, oh
 Estas haciendo ruido en mi coraz'n
 En mi coraz'n
 
 Yo la visto todo
 Yo hecho todo
 Yo lo vivo todo mi vida
 Por eso gozamos la vida
 Con el equipo que el party siga
 Ay chica deja la intriga
 Que yo no te digo mentiras
 Yo te digo la verdad
 Maybe te gusta maybe no, pero mami es la verdad
 Directo y al punto
 Vamos a viajar el mundo, juntos
 Tu y yo mamita, que tu sabe que t' est's rica
 
 Tu y yo
 Sin querer perdimos el control
 Y no qued' m's remedio
 Que perdemos en la habitaci'n
 Saca tu cuerpo a bailar
 Y no pares de sudar
 Alza tus manos al viento, oh, oh, oh
 Y que no pare la fiesta
 Siguen hasta que amanezca
 Alza tus manos al viento
 Tus manos al viento, oh

 All I wanna do is have some fun
 I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
 All I wanna do is take you home
 I got a feeling, this party has just begun
 It's all I want
 I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
 It's all I want
 And I got a feeling, that you're gonna give me some
 It's all I want
 Baby, it's all I want
 
 You know the type of women that I like
 The ones that understand my life
 The ones that understand wrong is right
 Let's do some wrong tonight
 You name it I'll do it, all is the fluid,
 I'm Spanish fluent, that means my tongue is bilingual
 Ready to play with that spot that you tingle
 Uh got a dingo, she's a star, Ringo
 Her and two friends? Mm, I like that lingo
 She asked if I'm single
 I said of course not, and she loved it
 Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public
 
 All I wanna do is have some fun
 I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
 All I gotta do is take you home
 I got a feeling, this party has just begun
 It's all I want
 I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
 It's all I want
 And I got a feeling, that you're gonna give me some
 It's all I want
 Baby
 It's all I want
 
 You know I love an open mind 
 So I can see what you thinking 
 That way I could give you exactly what you want
 Matter of fact what you drinking
 Some call it pimping, I call it leverage
 I call it slip'ing, they call it marriage
 She got me up like the Eiffel tower
 No Paris, momma you can fuck like the rabbits
 But no diamonds, no karates
 She asked if I was single, I said of course not
 And she loved it
 Next thing you know, we were both having fun in public
 
 All I wanna do is have some fun
 I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
 All I wanna do is take you home
 I got a feeling, this party has just begun
 It's all I want
 I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
 It's all I want
 And I got a feeling, that you're gonna give me some
 
 All I wanna do is have some fun
 I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
 All I wanna do is take you home
 I got a feeling, this party has just begun
 It's all I want
 I got a feeling, that I'm not the only one
 It's all I want
 I got a feeling, that you're gonna give me some
 It's all I want
 
 Baby it's all I want
 Baby It's all I want
 Baby It's all I want
 Baby it's all I want

 We could be anywhere tonight
 Could be right here underneath the lights
 I see the colours in your eyes
 Beautiful rainbows all around us
 We got the whole world in our hands
 This is the night we won't forget
 Whatever happens in the end
 I just hope, I hope we meet again
 
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 
 I just hope, I hope we meet again
 
 One thing's for certain, two things for sure
 I heart radio, I close show
 My life's like Broadway
 No cameras welcome to the show
 One champ for them boys on dictment
 Broadway, negro, I'm poster than post
 My boy I told ya, baby coming back one day
 Throw this song to the world and watch her catch it like a bouquet
 Australia to UK jump the puddle straight to the States
 Its okay let 'em hate, cause they'll be coming back one day, dale
 
 We could be anywhere tonight
 Could be right here underneath the lights
 I see the colours in your eyes
 Beautiful rainbows all around us
 We got the whole world in our hands
 This is the night we won't forget
 Whatever happens in the end
 I just hope, I hope we meet again
 
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 
 I just, I hope we meet again
 
 Now the world is my backyard
 And I would like to thank y'all
 'Cause I was at a point, point blank
 That I would point blank y'all
 I found myself, in turn I lost my mind
 Sometimes I feel like an old school Manny better lost in time
 They say to be wise, is to know what you don't know
 And I don't know shit, does that make me wise, papo I don't know
 But this much I cant say, to my  best friend Eddie,
 My father, guarilla, abuelo Rudy, to my brother drama
 I'll be back for you one day
 
 We could be anywhere tonight
 Could be right here underneath the lights
 I see the colours in your eyes
 Beautiful rainbows all around us
 We got the whole world in our hands
 This is the night we won't forget
 Whatever happens in the end
 I just hope, I hope we meet again
 
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 
 I hope we meet again
 I hope we meet again
 I hope we meet again

 Hoy se bebe!
 
 La rumba apenas comienza, el alcohol nunca se termina
 Dale, agarra la botella y sube las manos pa' arriba
 Date un shot para que te encienda, la m'sica te motiva
 Olv'date de los problemas, vamos a gozarnos la vida
 
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 
 Tengo la locura subida
 Dile a tu hermana, tu prima, tu tia
 Estamos la fiesta acabando
 Donde las mujeres tienen cara de fresa
 Y culo de mango
 
 Sigue gozando, sigue bailando
 Sigue brincando, sigue chichando
 Y cuando la cojo lo 'nico que dice es
 Ay papi, sigue armando
 
 Sigo para adelante, sigo andando
 Sigo en la lucha, sigo logrando
 Farruko y Pitbull
 Aqu' no hay sed, por que
 
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 Que hoy se bebe
 
 La rumba apenas comienza, el alcohol nunca se termina
 Dale agarra la botella y sube las manos para arriba
 Date un shot para que te encienda, la m'sica te motiva
 Olv'date de los problemas, vamos a gozarnos la vida
 
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 
 Ando suelto sin vacunar
 Dame un trago que me voy a mojar, la boca
 Esa mujer esta dura, esta buena, esta bella
 Esta linda, esta rica, esta loca
 
 Dale socia, as' me gusta, goza
 Baila soka, salsa, merengue
 Lambada y la empanada con la boca, opa!
 
 Que clase de nota
 Flacas o gordas, dale que sobra
 Farruko y Pitbull
 Que aqu' no hay sed, por que
 
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 Que hoy se bebe
 
 La rumba apenas comienza, el alcohol nunca se termina
 Dale agarra la botella y sube las manos pa' arriba
 Date un shot para que te encienda, la m'sica te motiva
 Olv'date de los problemas, vamos a gozarnos la vida
 
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 Que hoy se bebe
 
 Sube la mano para arriba
 Dale grita que hoy se bebe
 Hoy saliste para rumbiar
 Con todos ustedes
 
 Dale mueve, no te quedes
 Date un shot o no te atreves
 Ma'ana hay que trabajar
 Pero hoy se bebe
 
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 Que hoy se bebe
 Oeh oeh, oeh oeh
 
 Voy a beber
 Voy a beber
 Porque hoy se bebe
 
 Hee's baaacckk!!
 To rip on this  track, I'll rip any broad
 I don't care, white or black!
 Hee's baaacckk!
 If Pit's on the job, then there's no need to worry
 Dog just hurry up and wait
 'cause I ain't Going no where anytime soon
 Sick what these rappers want to be?
 That's me, times 2
 Now...
 Get ready for me to take over this game
 I'm cutting the flow, like I'm cutting the cane
 Things will never be the same
 Pause...
 There's a lick for 50 bricks
 Now pause...
 And think about it
 Then pause...
 Is it really worth it?
 Then pause... pause...
 FUCK YEAH!!!
 I'm ready to go, jump in the ride
 Get the mask, get the gloves
 Cut off the lights, pop the gat
 Run inside, fire'em up or tie'em up
 But don't forget to pick up the prize
 And upgrade the ??
 If they don't give up the pies
 Now...
 I would hate to have to calm these boys down
 'cause to be honest I can't, so Pal...
 Why don't you just give us the keys and pounds
 Now Guess What He Said?
 
 y'all want my spot?! Hurry up and wait!
 y'all want me to stop?! Hurry up and wait!
 y'all want me shot?! Hurry up and wait!
 y'all hurry up and wait! y'all hurry up and wait!
 
 I've been brought up
 By street cats who didn't get caught up
 Like that New Jack Nino Brown at the Carter
 I'm the new Tony Montana, only I'm just a
 Little bit smarter!
 
 Yeah
 Hah
 Yo
 Ugh
 Yeah
 
 He went from a street kid doin regular street things
 Straight to a street king
 Takin over the city, block by block
 Breaking down bricks, servin them rock by rock
 He's everything a young gun want to grow up to be
 But if only these young guns could see
 That murder, money, and lust is slowly murderin' us
 'cause the drug game ain't what it used to be
 So look deeper when they paint you a picture
 And try to sell you a dream
 'cause a lot of these drug lords turn to the feds, or turn into fiends
 The crack game ain't everything it's cracked up to be
 Now that same cat that was a, neighborhood celebrity
 Is coppin rocks off the news kids on the block
 At the same time tryna school them
 But these hoodlums got heads as hard as the rocks that he's doin'
 Hustlin's like a drug, it's got withdrawal symptoms
 And if you know this, you won't skip fame
 But you will gain wisdom, and wisdom gains power
 Don't let your life go sour over power
 
 Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
 The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
 The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
 If you used to push weight you relate 
 Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
 The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
 The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
 If you used to push weight you relate 
 
 Not only did my father used to deal dope
 He used to do the dope he used to deal, I'm juss' keepin it real
 Now my father doesn't have shit
 I don't have shit
 We don't have shit
 'cause he didn't stack shit
 With all the money he made, he didn't think for one second to put money away
 That's 'cause his mind was clouded with white thoughts
 He's lucky that he didn't end up outlined in white chalk
 The only thing I can say I gained from my father is
 Knowledge of the street game
 And I hope that y'all follow this
 I can't say I haven't sold weed or cocaine
 But I can say this
 Money that comes quick, leaves quick
 And y'all better believe this
 'cause this I've lived and witnessed
 Catch a couple of charges
 Now you're on the Lord's shit list
 Now you're forced to do business
 Until this business does you of course
 You can die doin' dope, or dealin dope, either or
 You choose the road that you need to follow
 And you choose the people that you look up to as role models
 
 Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
 The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
 The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
 If you used to push weight you relate 
 Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
 The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
 The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
 If you used to push weight you relate 
 
 I know about hustler's
 But I won't mention no names
 'cause they still got cases pending
 And some are even, appealing, life in the cage
 At least they made it past the first phase, they passed a certain age
 Hustlin's like AIDS
 At first your infected with HIV, and then it's full blown
 Only difference is, instead of havin' no immune system
 You become immune to the system of havin dough, by dealin blow
 It's a fast life and even if you survive, your mind will die slow
 Dirty money attracts, dirty things
 And if you plan to deal dope I hope you're ready for the murder game
 'cause that's what it brings
 I'm not a preacher, I'm not tryin' to preach, no
 I'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach, but yet
 Like a faucet, I'm tryin' to leak
 Any foe, tell these young'ns and their kinfolk
 And let em' know there's more to life than a G of coke
 If you used to push weight then you relate
 'cause you already had a taste of, hustler's withdrawal
 
 Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
 The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
 The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
 If you used to push weight you relate 
 Hustlin's like a drug, it's addicting
 The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
 The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
 If you used to push weight you relate

 You put it down like New York City
 I never sleep wild like Los Angeles
 My fantasy hotter than Miami I feel the heat
 Oh oh oh oh it's international love
 Oh oh oh oh it's international love
 
 I don't play football
 But I've touched down everywhere  everywhere
 I don't play baseball
 But I've hit a home run everywhere everywhere
 I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
 And the places on the globe I didn't know existed
 In Romania she pulled me to the side
 And told me Pit you can have me and my sister
 In Lebanon yeah the women the bomb
 And in Greece you guessed it the women are sweet
 Been all around the world
 But I ain't gonna lie there's nothing like Miami's heat
 
 You put it down like New York City
 I never sleep wild like Los Angeles
 My fantasy hotter than Miami I feel the heat
 Oh oh oh oh it's international love
 Oh oh oh oh it's international love
 
 Down in DR they're looking for visa's
 I Ain't taking credit cards if you know what I mean
 En cuba la cosa esta dura
 But the woman get down, if you know what I mean
 En Colombia the women got everything done, but they're
 Some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
 In Brazil they're freaky with big ol' boobs
 And their thongs, blue yellow and green
 En L.A. tengo la Mexicana, en New York tengo la boricua
 Besitos para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah
 Y en Miami tengo cualquiera

 Yea niggas, Welcome to Dade County 
 Where we slang rocks that claim blocks 
 And those red and blue lights just keep our streets hot 
 
 C'mon and ride with a nigga 
 so I can show you what Dade County really got 
 See don't be fooled by South Beach 
 Thinking when you come to the Bottom 
 You can just run these streets 
 You and your jewels are like a menu 
 And trust me nigga we intend to eat 
 
 Fuck around and cross that I-Three Ninety Five 
 You just run into a bunch of dead end streets 
 Niggas with wife-beaters and bare feet 
 That's right, I'm talking straight goon style 
 Go beyond that about three miles 
 and you're now entering the infamous Lil Havana 
 Now I know yall studio gangsters be vibing off the movie Scarface 
 But the wrong move in this place,

 And all that rap about your Lil Haiti connections? 
 Nigga you don't even know a real zoo 
 But I can introduce you to one that'll kick in your door 
 Put you faced down on the floor 
 And have your whole family wiring money from Chicago 
 
 But you a star, though 
 Okay, nigga if you a real G 
 This is where you tell your car to go 
 
 Opa Locka 
 Where there is continuous spotlight 
 helicopters and a triangle full of choppers 
 Carol City will make holes in you so big, 
 They can't be plugged by doctors 
 
 Nigga, this is the real Dade County 
 Where we are soldiers from birth to the hearse 
 That's why my childhood consisted of a bulletproof vest and a Pyrex 
 Nigga, you haven't even seen the real Miami, yet 
 So Welcome to Miami Dade County, the real Miami 
 Where we live and die, for life

 Pushin' a mainly line, travel the planet solid as granite
 Tax a bitch like a W-9
 Move manage, get my mathematics right
 Havin' money, wearin' a hoodie when it's sunny
 Huddled up in a circle, smoking a mummy
 In a luxury scraper or something foreign
 Ya bitch chose me, she said you're boring
 I put a bitch on restriction, make her sit on the porch
 Won't let her in 'till tomorrow, until the next morning, Mayne
 It's true that I'm chasing time can't be wastin' or delaying
 My pockets anticipating lump sums
 Patiently waiting for my high to come down and get back to earth
 So I can start all over like I rehearsed
 Pistol-packing power clatter higher than a cell tower
 In her outer space to wasted she owe me, we hella faded
 Underrated honey thicker than K. Michelle hella tail
 Bokey poking out, hella swell

 With all these around me.

 I'm in over my head, these women gone drown me.
 Spike lee was definitely talkin bout me when he made that movie 'jungle fever'.
 'cause I like em a little bit darker
 Take it from the back to the front, rosa parkuh
 But to tell you the truth, it makes no difference
 As long as they know what they doin when it's time to get busy
 We can take it from the floor to the bed from the bed to the kitchen
 Coffee with no cream,
 That's like a rock with no fiend
 Martin Luther king with no dream,
 John Lennon couldn't even imaging such a thing
 And for those that don't know nothin,
 Welcome to the jungle,
 'Clef tell em somethin
 
 Como?
 If you got that hot blood
 Esto es pa' la gente con sangre caliente,
 Turn around now back up,
 Preparate mujer porque mi lengua esta fuerte,
 Morenita que rica esta,
 She don't speak Spanish, ay mama,
 That's cool 'cause I'll put the Spanish in ya,
 And by the end of the night you'll say ay papa.
 I'm that chico that got a fetish with women
 Light skin red bones they blow my mind
 I'm that chico that'll get em and hit em
 Now all of a sudden they wanna be mine
 Stop playin with me
 Say it with me,
 Dale papi, dale papi oh
 And for those that don't know nothin,
 Welcome to the jungle,
 'Clef tell em somethin
 
 It's that jungle fever
 Fever

 Fever,
 Watch out watch out
 It's that jungle fever
 Fever

 Fever

 Fever
 Watch out watch out

 Now what I'ma do is uh, explain this uh, jungle fever to yall,
 This doesn't necessarily mean I like uh, dark women,
 Doesn't necessarily mean I don't like dark women,
 What it means is, uh
 To get nasty
 To get freaky
 To do things you've never done before
 To act like an animal straight out the jungle, that's jungle fever.

 Taught on these streets
 Ain't a god damn thing

 I'm like a nigga that did ten years

 The feds want to bug me
 Haters want to slug me
 I thank God
 Cause he's the only thing that's above me
 Y'all goin feel me till it hurts
 Like, losin your family over someone elses work
 Or,losin your case cause your co-defendent chirped
 Or, losin your brain cause them thangs done burped
 It gets worse
 This is for those
 That'll never see the sun again
 That'll pick through shit
 For a balloon just to get it in
 This is what was fed to him
 This is why the game let him in here
 Being me 
 Being Pit

 Both from the down south

 Thank God for the thugs too
 He understand what these drugs do

 Reducin they business
 If I wasn't doin this
 Then I'd go do him in
 Cause if he was dead

 Nah I ain't perfect but bitch I'm flawless
 Nah I ain't stupid but the flow is retarded
 Barely made high school, the streets was my college
 Rappin here for years, workin and grindin
 On the streets if you copped it, I supplied it
 I've worked everything, every drug you name it
 I've seen families get tied up for missin payments
 Keep thinking that this thing is just entertainment
 Disrepect, get introduced to the pavement
 Catch me somewhere on the islands of Caymen
 Me, I see the future, ya'll boys cavemen
 Now it's cartoons and tv shows
 First album gold, remix did fo, El Mariel in stores
 I hustle , I grind ,
 That's why they call me Mr. 305
 
 Hello, my name is not Mr. Right but you can be my missis tonight

 Broken rules have broken laws have broken hearts have broken all
 And if you put me on baby I'll break you off, this is the third mundo, take

 You know the game plan, I'm a quarter back with options
 I wanna go deep, hell mary, amen,

 'Cause every nigga in here want you! 
 
 You name it, she's got it, cheatin' realistic about it, 
 Disrespecting, act-a-fool in public, I doubt it! 
 If there's skeletons in the closet, that's where she keeps em, 
 I do business with sharks, so she stays quiet and peeps 'em.
 Even if she's playing with time sequence, she keeps 'em, 
 Never goes through his mind, she respects the crown, 
 I respect her mind, that's why I made her, man! 
 For me she'll fight the world, now that's my kinda girl! 
 
 My kind of girl, yeah, she's got a vision! 
 That's food for thought; now let 'em haters do the dishes! 
 
 A pair of tall heels and her stockings fishnets, 
 And ain't talking fishing, she's got a six sense.
 Green paper with dead people nah man don't impress her, 
 She'll break a full court so watch how you press her! 
 She came from nothing so she knows some, yeah, that's true! 
 For me she'll fight the world, now that's my kinda girl! 
 
 My girl's the kind of girl that walks in her room, 
 Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool.
 My girl is what these other girls wanna be, 
 But that's why she's with me, my kinda girl! 
 
 Sometimes she bougie, sometimes she hood
 Yeah, she's my town ass bitch! That's understood! 
 And when she's with me, she know she's good, 
 Yeah, she's my town ass bitch! 
 
 Drop that beat, it's the truth
 You don't know what you have until you lose it
 
 I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
 In my life, in my life
 I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
 In my life, in my life
 
 I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
 Earned my stripes
 But nothing compares to the love
 I have for you, have for you
 
 All I know is the hustle and grind
 And all you want is some quality time
 But I can't give it to you due to the life that I chose
 My heart?s so cold to the point my blood it froze
 
 I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
 But then again time is money and I needs mine
 There I go again being selfish
 And here you go again in love and helpless
 
 You mean the world to me, baby you know it's the truth
 But I don't know who I love more, you or the booth
 These are just some things I need to get off my chest
 Sometimes I feel all I can give you is sex, I'm sorry
 
 I've had all the women you could possibly imagine
 In my life, in my life
 I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money
 In my life, in my life
 
 I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
 Earned my stripes
 But nothing compares to the love
 I have for you, have for you
 
 I ain't gon' lie baby, this life is addicting
 The fame, the money, especially these bitches
 I've been around it all, I've seen 'em ball
 I've seen 'em fall, go broke and lose it all
 
 That's why I work hard 365, 24/7 baby, this my life
 I breathe, I bleed, I eat, I sleep, I shit this
 I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list
 
 Baby, I know it's hard to understand
 But it's out of my hands, baby this is God's plan
 I came, I saw, I conquered
 I apologize but this game made me a monster, I'm sorry

 Mr.Worldwide, Yandel
 Let's take it back to the 80's
 
 Se ha vuelto una aventura
 Como tu cama ninguna
 Yo me enrede en tu locura
 Bajo un eclipse de luna
 
 Yo me robe tu ternura
 Y he perdido hasta el sentido
 Despu's de lo que vivimos
 No paro de so'ar contigo
 
 Y te estoy entregando todo
 Y tu me dices que estoy loco
 No quiero parar 
 Y tu no puedes m's 
 
 Se que tu me quieres
 Don't you want me oh oh
 Se que tu me quieres
 Don't you want me oh oh
 
 Yo te leo la mirada y me dicen tus ojos, que tu eres mala
 Pero eso me gusta, vamos hacerlo en el carro, entonces en la sala
 Entonces en el ba'o, entonces en la cama, entonces en la mesa
 Entonces en el piso y tu gritas, ay que rico dale Pitbull!
 
 Como te suena
 No es el 24 de diciembre
 Pero si es una noche buena
 Deja la pena, que tu estas buena
 
 Y te estoy entregando todo
 Y tu me dices que estoy loco
 No quiero parar 
 Y tu no puedes m's 
 
 Se que tu me quieres
 Don't you want me oh oh
 Se que tu me quieres
 Don't you want me oh oh
 
 Yo te leo los labios y me dicen que tu, que tu sabes mucho
 Eres una droga, muy inteligente pero te haces la boba
 No matas los hombres, pero si les das soga, ay que loba
 Pero eso me intriga, en que me ha metido, ave mar'a
 
 Vamos a jugar el juego
 De formar figuras en p'blico
 Volverte loca mami
 Tu sabes que yo soy el 'nico
 
 Y te estoy entregando todo
 Y tu me dices que estoy loco
 No quiero parar 
 Y tu no puedes m's 
 
 Se que tu me quieres
 Don't you want me oh oh
 Se que tu me quieres
 Don't you want me oh oh
 
 Se que tu me quieres
 Don't you want me oh oh
 Se que tu me quieres
 Don't you want me oh oh
 
 We gon take it from the bottom 
 
 H-town! Pitbull, Bun B
 My dogg Demi, keep ya head up, I gotchu, I promise!
 All my chicos, I gotchu, I promise!
 Miami, I gotchu, I promise!! I'ma take over this bitch! I promise!
 So get ready mothafuckers, this is not a game!! 
 
 I'm from the dirty dirty, where a lot of these cats mix the weed
 With the coke and blow dirty, we're off the chain meng
 Rap game, crack game, cut it, cook it, chop it, record it
 Album shop it, its all the same thang
 Y'all look at these blue skies and think paradise
 I look at these blue skies, and think what a disguise
 That's why its called the "Magic City", it's a treat to your eyes
 Cross the bridge and it'll fuck with ya mind
 Word of advice don't follow the streets, follow the signs
 Cause the last thing you wanna do is get lost, cause it might just cost ya life
 Y'all heard about the smash-&-grabs
 So watch where you put the map on the dash
 Cause they might end up clapping ya ass
 Why you think the traffic lights, they blink at late night
 They don't want you to stop cause the streets'll be filled wit red stripes
 Like Jamaican beer, we fry 'em like bacon here
 Yo life'll get taken here, I just thought I should make it clear! Yeah!
 
 Everything we do is dirty!
 We pull up in the drop, it's dirty!
 We pound that twat, dirty!
 Miami!!!, we're dirty!
 Where they lace 'em, roll 'em, smoke 'em and blow 'em dirty!
 Guns they hold 'em, if they clean dogg, we make 'em dirty!
 
 Straight up outta Texas, the reckless, PA to be exact
 Where the streets is cutthroat and fiends kill you for a G of crack
 8 G's and Cadillacs, Chevy's cut on the deltas
 Might swang up on ya then hurt ya, nobody here gon help ya
 2000 heltah skelta, talking bout families and killer
 Vicious like silver-back guerrillas see then peel ya
 Niggas down here ain't tryna feel ya, see ya, hear ya, know ya
 Serve ya, for ya or for ya 
 You pussy niggas been hatin' on us for too long
 So we finna prove you wrong, teach you hoes a new song 
 Cause the time is now , the place is here 
 I could smell you scared nigga, I could taste your fear
 Go make it clear and move the smoke outta yo eyes
 So that when everything go down, it won't be no kind of surprise
 And I got no time for yo lies  save 'em for peter
 Just remember my name, I'm facing my heater  let's get it dirty!
 
 These boys from the bottom are obsessed with old school Chevy's
 We call 'em verts and donks, some we call box Chevy's
 Seven-duece, seven-trey, seven-four, seven-five
 M-I-A-M-I till I die, 3-0-5!
 Candy paint and leather, they don't fuck wit nothing but dubs or better
 Y'all call 'em street sweepers, we call 'em choppers
 Cause when the bullets spit they spin like helicopters
 This city's filled with crooked coppers and crooked doctors
 So how could these streets not be filled with crooked bitches
 And niggas cocaine cooking brick flipping bitches trippin' for figures
 Clip oh no he didn't
 
 This Cuban has seen it, heard about it and lived it
 That's why I spit it so vivid, you got it, I want it, you give it
 This is for everybody in county, T-G-K, Metro West and Stockade
 Doing time
 And if you got more than 365
 And you're up the road rep M-I-A with pride, That's right!
 
 I wear my heart upon my sleeve
 For you to see 
 I don't care what they believe we should be 
 I won't run away 'cause I can't change how I feel
 This is for those who don't believe what we got goin' on 
 About you and me 
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know 
 We could be the only ones, only to know 
 We could be the only ones to know
 We could be the only ones to know
 
 I see you baby 
 I wanna feel you baby 
 Sexy to hear you baby just keep your lips like the navy, seal them baby
 I live a life that movies are made of
 Sex, money, power and mayhem
 These boys ain't' players, they need to get their game on
 They can't even hit a lay up
 Fuck the Facebook, fuck the Twitter, fuck the Snapchat, fuck the Instagram
 Baby I got a massive plan Gingerbread man, catch me if you can
 
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know
 We could be the only ones to know
 We could be the only ones to know
 
 Baby let's get away and enjoy paradise together
 And if you understand my vision then we can knuckle up and take on the world together
 Live this life forever
 No one has to know how we move no one has to know what we do, just me and you
 Just you and I, Bonnie and Clyde, step on the gas let's ride
 Fuck the Facebook, fuck the Twitter, fuck the Snapchat, fuck the Instagram
 Baby I got a massive plan gingerbread man, catch me if you can
 
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know
 We could be the only ones, only ones to know
 We could be the only ones to know
 We could be the only ones to know
 
 They're mad 'cause they can't do the things that we can
 And they never been the places we've been
 That's right, all they do is talk shit
 They're mad 'cause they can't do the things that we can
 And they never been the places we've been
 That's why, all they do is talk shit
 
 We could be the only ones to know

 A 1980 exodus of 125,000 dreams, a quest to find out what freedom really means at any cost. Boat loads of Cubans lost in a maze of red tape and hate, entered this country through the bottom of the united states and straight set up shop. As Arthur McDuffie was being beat to death by four white cops this world was about to face the music. Between the El Mariel and the 1980 riots, we as minorities Americans could no longer take our freedom for granted and misuse it because incase you haven?t notices we?ve gone from the El Mariel boatlift to the Hurricane Katrina bus lift with the same response. With America standing to help us with one hand on her hips and the other one on her guns. Like 9/11 some how made us all Americans but it took a tragedy to make us all feel like we were one. You see the El Mariel boatlift, Hurricane Katrina and the Oklahoma bombings, we all got something in common and that?s the desire to enjoy a freedom that can not be rearranged by fear. To let nothing stand in the way of the freedom of those who chose to live here so today is 1980 again and I?m that bus that crashed through the gates of the Peruvian embassy. I hope that when I spit this poem the whole world will remember me. I?m screaming like  give us us our free, me Pitbull and this industry.
 
 Sooner or later that spark just disappears
 Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
 Every time one of us ending up in tears
 Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
 
 Is it good that we hurt every day?
 Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
 Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
 Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
 
 I live the fast life, going nowhere fast
 I see my past life and politely pass
 But I'm already planning on doing it big
 For my life after death, I live my life after death 
 Baby what you think our train is for?
 That's to properly prepare you for war
 So I keep you on your toes
 So you could look out for your friends that are really foes
 This career try to swallow us
 Paparazzi try to follow us
 I'm everything that my mama was
 Rider, survivor, a motherfuckin' fighter
 Thank god for this rapping shit
 Forget the cash, find happiness
 No more life, that's for the birds
 I work hard so you never say these words
 
 Sooner or later that spark just disappears
 Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
 Every time one of us ending up in tears
 Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
 
 Is it good that we hurt every day?
 Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
 Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
 Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
 
 The critics going nowhere 
 Thinking that they know me like the Bible, oh hell
 But they don't understand me oh well
 Snitching is a sport now so please do tell
 The world how I raise hell
 Yea, so the clown when I skip jail
 I'm just tryina own teams, beat it playa
 And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire
 The world is ours baby
 It's just waiting for us so don't be late
 And we could both aim for the sky
 And shoot for the stars and call it a day
 Now you know that I know that we know
 If the world wants war cock back and reload
 A normal life, that's for the birds
 I work hard, so you never say these words
 
 Sooner or later that spark just disappears
 Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
 Every time one of us ending up in tears
 Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
 
 Is it good that we hurt every day?
 Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
 Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
 Outta nowhere, outta nowhere

 Tuck your chains in, put your drinks down

 Piccalo in the V.I.P. whip, four fingers in the air

 Cuz Miami's full of dirty money and dirty things
 
 Mami look good from far, but when she got close
 she was far from good, and I was like "oooofff"
 I got the vodka, Cubo's got the cranberry juice

 Esto aqui es para los marinberos que tiene mas cadena que cuello
 Con dinero y una panza que parece que ese comieron el lechon entero
 I see mami who messes with nothin' but big tymers
 who loves to get her "Roll On" 
 Askin' me if I could get my hands on some vitamin E
 and I was like mami hold on
 But she must've loved Pac cuz she was grabbin' me, tellin' me
 "Papi picture me rollin"
 So I pictured it, and it would've been a sight for the blind to see
 So I gave it to her for free
 
 Verse three, I said it once and I'll say it again
 I want all y'all to eat but first me
 Get it? Got it? Good
 It's good that you got it cuz I got no time to be misunderstood
 I don't know if it's the liquor that's got me lit
 but damn, mami's thicker than thick
 If you like coke roll a dollar, snort it up
 If you like weed then you know the routine
 Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke that shit
 puff puff then pass that shit
 Mami, mami! Shake ya ass, but watch yourself
 Cuz - messin' with me, you might end up in a movie

 En la noche cuando le haces el amor
 
 Mentiras y celos, deja eso
 Con esta cara pa amitades, por supuesto
 La vida de Armando es de verdad, por supuesto
 Y lo que haga se convierte en realidad, por supuesto
 No hay mentira, yo soy honesto, vivo, directo
 Y aqu' no hay cuento
 Mamita, te enamoras por el momento
 Pero yo no, lo siento
 Ahora dile
 
 Oye loca, ven pa 'ac'

 Soy el que te provoca
 Dile la verdad
 Dile la verdad
 En la noche cuando le haces el amor
 
 It's cold and snow's actually on the ground
 of this no-snow town,
 and instead of cars
 the street's trafficking in sleds.
 Men become boys again
 
 There's a war on the corner
 with no guaranteed winner.
 It's just a snowfall of snowballs
 evidence of the winter.
 
 And I can feel my hands again.
 We're almost home.
 
 It's 2 P.M. and our snow is falling still
 as our good city lay still.
 And our friends are packed
 around some no smoking bar
 warming on alcohol.
 We step into the silence,
 yeah, we step slowly and quiet.
 
 All boys come on and girls join up,
 just don't grow old.
 All boys come on and girls join up,
 we're almost home.
 
 This is all we want:
 Time to be with us,
 a home to lift the cold.
 
 Still cold, the snow's turning into rain
 and melting away.
 And all these days slip by us,
 so let's keep them.

 Don't you you know that every chicos peoples got perico
 But what you know bout them Dade county chicos that's lethal
 They work with their Chevy's and Regals on rims
 First stud and hand it to me, desert eagle, but for me it was to big
 I don't know bout y'all, but I'd die for the crib
 Mr. three o five, he on fire and that's what it is
 And no fire, he don't fail, man I can't, I got kids
 And I'll be god damn if they stomach touchin' they ribs
 This is real talk
 I hang with them boys that will cock, will pop
 Ready to chop or we'll chop
 Play with it
 And you J F K right on M L K when them AK spray
 Man, welcome to Dade

 No estoy hablando de la que te congela la boca
 Esta cosa duerme en la boca como un dentista, compa'
 La que te toca el coraz'n como un tambor de panda
 Como si estuvieras corriendo un marat'n en Ghana
 Los huevos y las palabras es lo que zafa tu alma
 Hasta los puches cardinales se hace que los cantan
 En pistas, cabrones caen enfrente de mi cara
 Y si la polic'a me cuestiona, no vi nada
 Estas calles no son de confianza para nada
 En el barrio se respete el c'digo, o no hay ma'ana
 Desaparece ese que toma mal decisiones
 En esta playa no se acerca ni los tiburones

 Anjuli Star,

 This dedicated to everybody who lost somebody important in their life, 
 Don't worry their in a better place now.
 
 I fear not what the future holds
 But more what the future unfolds
 Cause I'm dying each time that I breathe in life without you 
 Every hour solemn I need you
 Undevoured I'm falling now what can I do
 There's so much to give
 If only I had my hands to fix what you did
 So I hold it inside watch as it dies
 I can't even look at the sky its burning my eyes
 Similar to cigarette smoke I wish I could float far away from here
 
 Raindrops
 I hope one day that this pain stops 
 Raindrops
 I hope one day that this pain stops
 Washing me away
 Washing me away
 Washing me away
 Washing me away
 
 I miss you dad
 
 Still dealing with my the death of my father
 Still dealing with the death of my best friend
 Eddie I'm a miss you dog
 But you know that I'm a ride to the end 
 I didn't cry when you died
 But I'm a let my tears fall on the track
 My brother yula just came home
 And it feels good to have him back
 
 See everything happens for a reason
 You don't know what you had till its gone
 That's why I'm a take advantage of the fact I'm breathin
 And the words of this song are
 Dedicated to Eddie and maria
 But I know in the future I'm a see ya
 I know your both looking down on me , proud
 I know ya both love me
 
 Raindrops
 I hope one day that this pain stops 
 Raindrops
 I hope one day that this pain stops
 Washing me away
 Washing me away
 Washing me away
 Washing me away
 
 See in life things go wrong
 If it don't kill you its only goin' make you strong
 So you must hold on
 If everything was right then there's something wrong
 Ironic ain't it that's just the way life is
 That's why I thank god every chance that I get for blessing me
 With beautiful kids
 
 What's victory with no laws
 What's smiling with no tears
 Whats love with no hate
 Whats courage with no fears
 Just think about it and apply to your life
 And no matter what the problem is
 Don't worry baby keep your head up
 Its goin' be alright
 
 Oh yeah, 
 And you know I rep my city
 My, my, my city
 You know I rep my city

 Penqueno Juan
 Frankie J
 Ken-Y
 Mamita, why we gotta keep going through this?
 Talk to her, Frankie
 
 Just yesterday you said you loved me
 That there was nobody else above me
 That I was yours and you were mine
 That there was no limits to our skies
 But then you had to put our love on hold
 When it came to making love, it wasn't you anymore
 And now you're telling me to leave
 I gotta walk out the door
 Can't you see that this is killing me?
 It's hurting my soul
 Oh baby
 
 How am I supposed to leave you
 When my heart tells me to keep you?
 How can you ask me to let you go?
 No, I just can't let you go
 No, I just can't let you go
 
 Can't you see I'm slowly dying?
 But I'm gonna keep on trying
 Please don't ask of me to let you go
 
 Let me start
 By telling you I love you with all my heart
 But I can't understand the reason
 When you tell me you're leaving
 Girl, me and you were supposed to be forever and ever
 Now instead of being in love
 It's like we are used to each other
 How could we do this to each other?
 We use to ride for each other
 Die for each other
 Cry for each other
 Now, it's like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other
 I can't let this happen
 I refuse to lose you
 I love you, baby
 It's the truth as usual
 I wanna make you happy
 Girl, it ain't hard to see
 You mean the world to me
 We had been though it all
 Thick or thin, right or wrong
 I can't let you go 'cause this love is too strong
 
 Look, baby, just tell me what you want
 Look, baby, just tell me what you need
 Look, baby, I know I'm far from perfect
 But the game and the money - they can take 'cause it's worthless
 I know it's hard to deal with my life
 I know it's hard to deal with all the gossip
 I done seen 'em wit' this one
 I done seen 'em wit' that one
 But everything they say is monotonous
 Can't you hear it in my voice?
 Mami, you know you're my heart, my soul, my love
 And I swear to you, baby
 I just want to give you my heart, my soul, my love
 I know we can work this out
 I know we can
 Baby, let's try
 But one thing I won't do is let this love die
 
 Believe me; yes, I'm trying to let you go
 But the only thing I get from it is all this crying
 Tell me, how am I supposed to let you go?
 No, no, no
 
 If you came to get
 If you came to get
 If you came to get
 
 If you came to get crazy
 Then you came to the right place
 DJ drop drop the bass
 Shut down the place
 Show these jokers who got the ace
 These girls got sex written on their face
 I'm in the zone ah
 About to conquer everything like Rome
 I'm feeling golden
 Can't stop 'em, can't control 'em
 Only hope to contain unless if you know 'em
 Now it's time to get get get crazy
 Get get get loose, get get get wild
 Right right right now
 Let's take over the world
 Your way girl
 
 So give me that high
 Like you did last night, did last night
 'Cause I was high
 When you made me fly 
 
 So give me that high
 Like you did last night, did last night
 'Cause I was high
 When you made me fly 
 
 I'm a biggidy mic checker, on biggidy big records
 A biggidy big playboy with women for breakfast
 You're mistaking if you're thinking it's just a song
 This my life from dusk til dawn
 I'm not the best, I'm just better
 Yeah, they smart
 Me? I'm clever
 At 45 thousand feet
 You think I care about the weather?
 Okay, maybe a little
 Turbulence is like fame
 It's hard to get used to, especially with Youtube
 Hah!

 And I ain't talkin about Lorenas in tutus

 Killin `em in suits then choppin up the deuces

 Live in hotels, swing on plane
 Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
 Club jumping like Lebron, now, Voli

 We about to climb, wild, 'cause it's about to go down
 
 Swing your partner round and round
 End of the night, it's going down

 I knew my rent was gon' be later 'bout a week ago

 But I got just enough
 To get off in this club
 Have me a good time, before my time is up
 Hey, let's get it now
 
 Ooh I want the time of my life
 Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
 
 Let's get it now
 
 This is the last twenty dollars I got
 But I'mma have a good time ballin' or out
 Tell the barteneder line up some shots
 Cause I'mma get loose tonight
 She's on fire, she's so hot
 I'm no liar, she burn up the spot
 Look like Mariah, I took another shot
 Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
 Dirty talk, dirty dance
 She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
 She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
 And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck
 I told her I wanna ride out, and she said yes
 We didn't go to church, but I got blessed
 
 I knew my rent was gon' be later 'bout a week ago
 I work my ass off
 But I still can't pay it though
 But I got just enough
 To get off in this club

 Hey, let's get it now
 
 Ooh I want the time of my life
 Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life

 Party every night like my last
 Mommy know the drill, shake that ass
 Go ahead baby let me see what you got
 You know you got the biggest booty in this spot
 And I just wanna see that thing drop
 From the back to the front to the top
 You know me I'm off in the cut
 Always like a Squirrel, looking for a nut
 This isn't for show I'm not talking 'bout luck
 I'm not talking 'bout love, I'm talking 'bout lust
 Now let's get loose, have some fun
 Forget about bills and the first of the month
 It's my night, your night, our night, let's turn it up
 
 I knew my rent was gon' be later 'bout a week ago
 I work my ass off
 But I still can't pay it though
 But I got just enough
 To get off in this club
 Have me a good time, before my time is up
 Hey, let's get it now
 
 Ooh I want the time of my life
 Oh baby ooh give me the time of my life
 Hey, hey, hey

 Say you might as well roll it up,
 Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight
 I said, everybody goin' through somethin'
 
 Said, everybody goin' through somethin'
 
 Say you might as well roll it up,
 Pour it up, drink it up, throw it up tonight
 
 This is for anybody going through times
 Believe, been there, done that
 But everyday above ground is a great day, remember that
 
 I knew my rent was gon' be later 'bout a week ago
 I work my ass off
 But I still can't pay it though
 But I got just enough
 To get off in this club
 Have me a good time, before my time is up

 Red Foo, Mr. Worldwide
 Mr. Vain, Rush
 
 You took my love, I thought I was the only one
 You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
 You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
 You took my love, took my love
 
 Loquita, I don't play, you know what time it is with me
 You want my heart, you got to work
 And show me that you'd ride it there for me
 I can see right through your eyes, and I know what you tryin' to do
 You tryin' to rob, steal, take my love, well fuck you
 
 Take my love, ha ha, not a woman on earth that can do that
 Say what, I don't know where you from, or where you been at
 I'm letting you know what's up, and if you don't play by the rules
 Oh baby, you get cut, I talked so much, you took my love
 
 You took my love, I thought I was the only one
 You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
 You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
 You took my love, took my love
 
 Yaoh, I'm in the club, and the place is poppin'
 Sip-sippin' bub and the bass is knockin'
 Times are great, 'cause I'm with my crew
 But my smile is fake, 'cause I'm missing you
 Baby you know that I didn't learn my lesson
 Shoulda gave you more time, more love and affection
 And when I see you later with that other guy
 Keep telling myself a player ain't suppose to cry
 
 You took my love, I thought I was the only one
 You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
 You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
 You took my love, took my love
 
 She took my love, and played me for a sucker
 But it don't even matter, 'cause you know I still love her
 She took my heart, and threw it on the ground
 But it don't even matter, 'cause I still want her around
 
 She's such a love taker, she's such a love taker
 It's guaranteed that she's a professional heart breaker
 But a great love maker, all in a sheet
 She made my heart skip a beat
 But for now she's as cold as they come
 Not mags, no life and no guns
 She took my love
 
 You took my love, I thought I was the only one
 You took my love, it feels like you did it for fun
 You took my love, but my heart keeps telling me you're the one
 You took my love, took my love
 
 Love
 
 Love
 
 Love
 
 Love

 Of all these motherfuckin' situations, Watch this,
 
 I'm here to remind you, just in case you forgot,
 MR 305 no label stay hot,
 38 choppers, but please no glock,
 Used to move work but had no
 Trap no block no spot,
 Ma was cool with work, but no rocks,
 Until she found my first nickel ruff bag,
 Said I had enough shit to push a dad,
 So she told me to get the fuck out the pad,
 I was out to my first baby mama's crib,
 Caught her fuckin' round with her wellas crib,
 Thank god for music my saviour,
 That's what helped me fight Xavier,
 Don't believe these rappers and what they play ya,
 I wanna be owner, fuck a playa,
 Shit better say it,

 Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,
 City on my back and I won't surrender,
 Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,
 They don't know ,

 They don't know ,
 They don't know, they don't know,
 
 My life, pain,
 Struggle, hustle, grind,
 Them boys knock me down,
 You must be out yo fuckin' mind,
 My mom taught me to fight,
 Dade county raised me right,
 And we gon' take over this thing,
 Put down my fuckin' life,
 
 Lemme come back, I've been here for years,
 Grindin', blood, sweat and tears.
 I don' gave the game my life,
 Turned the streets from my bitch to my wife,
 Every mornin' I woke up to the same shit,
 Everybody sayin' that I ain't shit,
 Them boys in the streets on that hate shit,
 Them boys on the same street doin' that same shit,
 Planned to move bricks, but it's 8 balls,
 Y'all want me, I hate y'all but I ate y'all,
 Young and stay, we realest,
 I'm on my way to the show,
 Gettin' paid, marvelous rates,
 You the ace I'm the spade,
 Cut cut gay, buck buck spray,
 This ain't a duck duck goose,
 This duck duck hey, plus hey duct tape ace that.
 
 I got the city on my back and I won't surrender,
 Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,
 City on my back and I won't surrender,
 Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,
 They don't know ,
 They don't know ,
 They don't know ,
 They don't know, they don't know,
 
 Now you can stack the world against me,
 Close the doors, I can't come in,
 You could bet your life against me,
 Bet your ass I'm gonna win,
 You take that chance, you roll them dice,
 I prove you wrong, you prove me right,
 So damn what they say anyway

 Mr. Worldwide, I just want to welcome everybody to my life
 It's heaven on earth, but it's one hell of a ride
 Kiesza, let's show everybody why love is a battlefield
 Tell them how you feel
 
 We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
 No promises, no demand
 Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield
 
 Closed the Grammys and got all the credits, literally
 But I'm a hustler boy, you can't rid of me
 I'm not religious but my passport looks like a bible
 Presidential debates unreliable
 Politicians want to politick and politrick
 That's why I call this shit politricks
 I'm a young man, old soul
 I can't listen to this new school shit to me it's just so-so
 I did my own thing, created my own lane
 I may not like the players, but I love the game
 I love the hustle and that's real
 And that's why love is a battlefield
 
 We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
 No promises, no demand
 Love is a battlefield
 We are strong
 No one can tell us we're wrong
 Searching our hearts for so long
 Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield
 
 Born in Miami, Cuban boy in the '80s
 Took over the game and they thought we were crazy
 You name it we did, we bought it, we sipped it, we run it
 Let all these public traded companies know that we're coming
 David vs. Goliath, live in the flesh, Armando Perez, boy am I blessed
 I learned from the worst, but listened to the best
 Figure out that riddle and figure out success
 I did my own thing, created my own lane
 I may not like the players, but I love the game
 I love the hustle and that's real
 And that's why love is a battlefield
 
 We are young, heartache to heartache we stand
 No promises, no demand
 Love is a battlefield
 We are strong
 No one can tell us we're wrong
 Searching our hearts for so long
 Both of us knowing, love is a battlefield
 
 Yeah Yeah
 Que Vuelta?
 Di le nota 
 You know who it is
 For all these bustas and haters
 
 We don't care about yo clique
 We don't care about yo crew
 We don't care about yo bitch
 We don't care what you do
 We don't care about your car
 We don't care about your chips
 We don't care about shit
 accept getting rich
 
 Now that Little Jon has opened the door
 It's over dawg
 This that new south
 That's it, it's over ya'll
 No more warning ya'll
 We tired of getting over looked
 You want beef? then I hope you like it over-cooked
 Oh and for that bread
 It's whatever man
 I'm fully prepared to pump lead
 At any nigga that want to bump heads
 So bring it
 But when them things go Rr-rr-rr-rringing
 Someones gonna get hit
 And that's a fact, not an opinion
 I'm buiding my connects
 And that there is dangerous
 Didn't your mother teach you
 Not to talk to strangers?
 Then why are you in my ear talking all the shit
 Just 'cause I'm cuban doesn't mean I flip bricks
 So stop asking me the price on them thangs down here
 'Cause that one of them thangs that get chu killed 'round here
 I don't care who you are, who you might be
 But I'd rather die, then let an undercover bite me
 
 I'm in this bitch now
 Ya'll niggaz better get ready
 I'm ready for whatever ya'll want
 Boy, but it ain't nothing pretty
 Ya'll want to start shit
 Tell me what ya'll want to do
 Me, Pit, DB, we don't care about ?
 I don't care about slanging them thangs
 Back 'em spraying them thangs
 If you get ? just homie don't mention my name
 BLAKAH, that's exactly what I'm spitting meng
 Homie, don't make me have to blow 'em chopper meng
 'Cause I can spit it spit it
 However you want it want it
 My peoples is with it with it
 We about that money money
 And I do anything that I have to do to get that money meng
 Miami, Money is a major issue meng
 They, They don't understand
 
 What we about to do
 We about to shit on this game
 We about to shit on your crew
 Pitbull don't care about ya
 Cubo don't care about ya
 DB don't care about ya
 We, We don't care about ya
 
 This game is scandalous
 The more money you make
 The more your ? hold off in an ambulance
 AOWoo!
 That's why I say to myself in the cut
 Man I can't be seen
 Ears open, mouth shut
 Just watching thangs
 And if it pops off
 I pop up, both popping than
 Guns, I was taught proper
 To cop and aim
 Run, when you hear that Blakah meng
 P-rr-rr-rrat
 That's the sound of the chopper meng
 Just let me know exactly what it is you trying to do
 'Cause we can both dance with the devil, dawg
 It's all on you

 In a casket dawg, who the fucks gon follow you?

 And Uncle Luke will tell you the same shit

 Mr.Worldwide
 From Miami, Morocco, to Austrailia
 To the world, dale!
 
 Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
 Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
 
 When the sun goes down, down, down, down
 Boy are you afraid of the dark, dark?
 And when the lights go out, out, out, out
 Tell me, do you know where to start, start?
 And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
 That is when I feel a part, part
 And when the world screams "sound, sound, sound"
 Where the sound is the key to my heart, heart
 
 We run yes the we run the night, ni-night, night, ni-ni-night
 We run yes the we run the night, we-we-we run, we-we-we run, run
 We run yes the we run the night, the night
 Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
 Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
 Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
 
 From the bottom of the map, Miami,
 To the land down under, Australia,
 You feel my drive, see my vision and hear my hunger
 As my money gets older, theirs get younger
 They sell their soul but the Devil knows I have no number
 I'm go go baby, fresh oh baby, go go baby, uh oh baby, no no baby
 Yeah yeah baby, now jiggle it baby, let me tickle it baby,
 I know I'm lost it's gon' be hard to save me,
 I'm sorry that's how Dade county raised me,
 Y'all heard me right we run the night, now fuck you pay me
 
 We run yes the we run the night, ni-night, night, ni-ni-night
 We run yes the we run the night, we-we-we run, we-we-we run, run
 We run yes the we run the night, the night
 Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
 Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
 Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
 
 Feelin' like a rush, rush, rush
 Brushing past me all over my skin, ski-i-i-in
 I can get enough, 'nough, 'nough
 'Cause the beat keep pullin me in, in
 Takin' me so high, up, up, up
 A place that I've never been, aah
 Party, party all night, night, night
 Sleep all day then do it again, 'gain
 
 We run yes the we run the night, ni-night, night,
 Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
 We run yes the we run the night, we-we-we run, we-we-we run, run
 We run yes the we run the night, the night, ni-ni-ni-ni
 Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
 
 I know ya'll heard the name,
 And if you haven't, its pitbull once again,
 Aint shit changed,
 My purpose is the still the same,
 Which is to purposely kill the game,
 I'ma set ya'll free,
 It took Eminem 8, but it takes us 90 miles to reach the keys, in order to be free,
 Subtract 8 from 90, which equals 82,
 Take 2 from that which equals when them Cubans came through,
 Touched down and made they present felt,
 Pitbull ima make my present felt,
 I don't got time to mention names,
 Especially some one who named themselves after the same chain that got robbed from me,
 Come through with 24 ks and drop you faster than Atlantic dropped 24k,
 Ima hustler, I switch hustles every hour, so every day I hustle 24 ways,
 You're like H I V, I'm like full blown AIDS,
 And yes this foo's from Gator,
 I'm from where all the Cubans stay,
 Act like pussy and like pussy get laid,
 Fact! Oops did I say that?
 Yes I did, pitts the new kid,
 
 Chorus: 
 I'm bittin em, locken em now,
 I'm runnin through, ain't no blockin me now,
 I stay strong, ain't no knockin me down,
 Ya'll started, ain't no stoppen me now,
 
 Even though you got your face slashed, I'm rap scar face,
 And like rap scar face, I'm the last of a dyin breed,
 I'm a animal and BIG wrote me a manual,
 On how to flip six digits annual,
 I got nothing to lose but on the other hand,
 You lost everything, that's what drinkin all that henney brings,
 Pitbulls down for anything,
 More money more problems,
 More power more cowards, 
 Or more flowers-- for the dead,
 Cause its over,
 Maybe you'll realize when you're sober,
 That Pitt's moved up to a general from just a soldier,
 Now we can do this on or off the books,
 I hope your mob rolls deep cause I know you shook,
 I used to look up to ya,
 Now look down on ya,
 I mean damn homie, before Pun died you were the man homie,
 You were next up to bat but you struck out,
 Now you outta luck cause Pitt's been waitin in the dug out to slug out,
 Now its my turn to step to the plate,
 Spittin banana clips at any monkey ass nigga that thinks he's an ape,
 
 Cube will drop the bomb but I got the 
 You talk a good game but you don't do shit,
 It's been three years and still no new shit,
 I bought the lac, grey mac, 
 While I was workin hard, you had it on a silver platter brat,
 You scar face 2? 
 Why telling lies to me, but most important, why you telling lies to you,
 
 Let's Mr.Worldwide 
 Take over, MK
 Jim Jonson, globe, 
 Let's take over the globe
 
 Hey hey yeah
 
 Hey hey yeah
 
 Hey hey yeah
 
 Hey hey yeah
 
 Let the world know
 Where do we go from here?

 From here
 
 And you wanna tell me the sky's the limit, 
 When there's footprints on the moon,
 I don't need a TV show to dance with the stars
 Not me, I'm good 
 
 Half of the world don't like me 
 Half of the world wanna be me 
 But believe me that pretty little thing they call earth
 Needs me
 
 I am here to show the world what it means to make
 Something from nothing 
 I am here to show the world what it is to do good business
 Have glue without flow
 
 I'm here to show the world that money don't buy
 Happiness, believe me, I know 
 But just one thing I wanna show the world
 I just wanna know
 
 Where do we go from here?
 World,tell me please?
 Where do we go from here?
 I want the world to tell me please
 
 Where do we go?

 Where do we go?
 
 From here
 
 As the sun rotates and pit gets bigger
 And there more countries in the world like Hitler
 Commando bomb, double 0, 3, 0, 5
 AKA Mr.Worldwide
 
 Don't be silly, I've had it on lock and
 That's fo'sho, 
 I already changed my city
 Now I'm on my way to change the globe 
 
 I'm trying to inspire the world to show
 What you did when you hustle and you work hard
 Show'em what it is to put your life on the line
 For the love of the crime
 
 Life is a rhyme with no reason
 And that's the reason I rhyme
 But once I show the globe
 I just wanna know
 
 Where do we go from here?
 World,tell me please?
 Where do we go from here?
 I want the world to tell me please
 
 Where do we go from here?
 World,tell me please?
 Where do we go from here?
 I want the world to tell me please

 Where do we go?
 Where do we go?
 
 Where do we go?

 Where do we go?
 Where do we go?
 Where do we go?

 Chorus
 
 Twenty-seven spanishes
 Arriving from the sea
 Blades of steel flashing
 Cutting down the eagle's tree
 
 Came riding in on mountains
 On red and silver steeds
 Into the city of the serpent
 Through the gates of the Otomi
 
 A soldier dressed in iron asks
 "Where do you all come from?"
 "From the earth of four directions
 From the purple clouds above"
 
 Just then a rain came falling down
 As the wind began to blow 
 The sky then turned to crimson
 With a sound so deep and low
 
 Said the brown prince to the spanishes
 As he raised a mighty hand
 "Don't come here bringing worries
 To the people of this land"
 
 Their swords then turned to deadly snakes
 Like the ones found in the grass
 "Get back into those silly ships
 Before we kick your ass"
 
 But the strangers made an offer
 So the brown prince said "why not"
 And ended up with empty plates
 And boot soup in a pot
 
 Later they became muy friendly
 And their blood was often mixed
 Now they all hang out together
 And play guitars for kicks
 
 Speak softly, don't wake the baby
 Come and hold me once more
 Before I have to leave
 Because there's a lot of work out there
 Everything will be fine
 And I'll send for you baby
 Just a matter of time
 
 Our life, the only thing we know
 Come and tell me once more
 Before you have to go
 That's there's a better world out there
 Though it don't feel right
 Will it be like I hope
 Just a matter of time
 
 And I hope it's all it seems
 Not another empty dream
 There's a time for you and me
 In a place living happily
 
 And I hope it's all it seems
 Not another empty dream
 There's a time for you and me
 In a place living happily
 
 Walk quietly, don't make a sound
 Believe in what you're doing
 I know we can't be wrong
 Don't worry about us here
 It will be alright
 And we'll be there with you
 Just a matter of time
 And we'll all be together
 Just a matter of time
 A matter of time, a matter of time
 We'll be together
 In a matter of time
 You and me, a matter of time
 It will be like I hoped
 A matter of time
 
 Who's feeling sorry now?
 Just when I thought I knew how
 The man with the master plan
 Let it all slip through my hands
 
 Why did you turn on me?
 I'm the same man that I used to be
 Did you forget who I am?
 I'm the man with the master plan
 
 But every day's the same
 Nothing seems to change
 My life is just minutes away
 And all I wanted to do was dance
 
 How could this happen to me?
 I had it all worked out to a T
 Went through it with a fine toothed comb
 Now you want to leave me alone
 
 Every day's the same
 Nothing seems to change
 My life is just minutes away
 And all I wanted to do was dance
 
 I didn't ask for much
 I maybe didn't ask for enough
 I maybe should've forced your hand
 But all I wanted to do was dance
 
 When we were young
 Taking time to believe
 If only to survive
 What you gotta believe
 
 If only to survive
 Survive in this world
 In this crazy life
 Gotta give it a whirl
 
 All my bridges burning
 Almost burnin' down
 All my bridges burning
 Burning to the ground
 It's burning down
 
 Burning down
 
 Try'n hard to believe
 There's something more than me
 Something outside myself
 That wants me to be free
 
 Set my bridges all aflame
 So I could not return
 Gotta walk on straight ahead
 To learn what I need to learn
 
 All my bridges burning
 Almost burnin' down
 All my bridges burning
 Burning to the ground
 It's burning down
 
 Burning down
 
 Going where I belong
 I hope there's time for love
 Don't care what time it is
 It's just never enough
 
 Just making music
 Keep my feet on the ground
 Couldn't live without it
 Helps me to stick around
 
 All my bridges are burning
 Almost burnin' down 
 All my bridges are burning
 Burning to the ground
 
 Good night, sleep tight
 The big bright sun has gone away
 Done gone away
 Goodbye, don't cry
 Tomorrow will bring us a brand new day
 We can run and play
 
 And they'll laugh up and down the hall
 Don't go shout when you hear them fall
 Little two step angel dance
 
 Big night, bright lights
 Time now to lay them all to rest
 Put 'em all to rest
 Bad guys, mean eyes
 All gone away to where they belong
 Let's just sing our song
 
 And they'll laugh up and down the hall
 Don't go shout when you hear them fall
 Let them fly across the wall
 Let them cry, 'til the morning calls
 
 Good days, new ways
 Let go of all things when you sleep
 When you're all asleep
 Good night, sleep right
 Tomorrow is gonna bring us another day
 So we can run and play
 
 And they'll laugh up and down the hall
 Don't go shout when you hear them fall
 Let them fly across the wall
 Let them cry, 'til the morning calls
 Little two step angel dance
 Little two step angel dance
 
 Broken window smile
 Weeds for hair
 Strolling 'round the corner
 Like a millionaire
 
 And the angels with dirty faces
 Go it alone
 
 With one shoe on
 And one shoe lost
 Stands a wounded man
 Who just laughs it off
 
 And the angels with dirty faces
 Go it alone
 And the angels with dirty faces
 Go it alone
 
 Lost a brother last night
 To the howling wind
 Find an empty doorway
 It'll be back again
 
 And the angels with dirty faces
 Go it alone
 And the angels with dirty faces
 Go it alone
 
 Cuando te cases con el otro ir' a tu boda
 Cuando pregunten en seguida me opondr'
 Y si pregunta el cura que porqu' me opongo
 Yo le dir' que porque tu eres mi querer
 
 Y si se enoja el que iba a ser tu esposo
 Saco mi cohete y me pongo a disparar
 Al fin y al cabo yo no le temo a la muerte
 Y voy al bote porqaue soy la autoridad
 
 Ay! Anselma, Anselma, Anselma
 Chaparra de mis penares
 O, dejas que te visite
 O, te mando a los gendarmes
 
 Y si te niegas a matrimoniar conmigo
 Les quito el rancho y propiedad de tu papa
 Les pongo impuestos y hasta les quemo la casa
 Porque por algo soy aqu' la autoridad
 
 Yo ordeno, y mando en todo este municipio
 Yo te lo digo por si quieres escapar
 All' en el otro el que manda es mi t'o Elijio
 No m's le aviso y te tiene que agarrar
 
 Ay! Anselma, Anselma, Anselma
 Chaparra de mis penares
 O, dejas que te visite
 O, te mando a los gendarmes
 
 Could have had a chance to get out of this wreck
 The time that you came and the day that you left
 Could have had a chance
 Could have had a chance
 
 Never thought I could make it this far
 With a dent in my soul and a hole in my heart
 Never thought I could
 Never thought I could
 
 But when the lights are turning 'round
 And wheels are rolling on the ground
 That day I'll burn this whole place down
 When the circus comes to town
 
 You left your name carved on a tree
 You scratched mine out right in front of me
 Didn't mean that much
 Didn't mean that much
 
 I'll scratch your name out on that tree
 I'll chase your heart right out of me
 Doesn't mean that much
 Doesn't mean that much
 
 Let the calm, calm blue waters through
 Wash your soul, passing right through you
 Like the smallest rose out of the hardest ground
 Like a tiny hand reaching up for the sun
 Let us pray that our hearts are one
 The toughest love is the strongest one
 Like a crippled man fights his bitter pain
 On two tired legs that hope to walk once again
 Just stay gold and be still
 
 As we grow, a river flows
 Through our hearts
 Finding peace wherever it may go
 
 As we grow, a river flows
 Through our hearts
 Finding peace wherever it may go
 
 Let the pure, pure blue waters through
 Don't let the wind take them away from you
 Like the littlest star
 Shines in the darkest night
 Like a mother's ache brings in a new life
 Stay gold and be still
 Pray that we all can stay gold and be still
 
 In the sunlight of your smile
 In the summer of our life
 In the magic of love
 Storms above scattered away
 
 Lovers dreaming in the night
 Reaching for paradise
 But as the dark shadows fade
 Love slips away
 
 On an empty stretch of beach
 In the pattern of the waves
 Drawing pictures with my hand
 In the sand, I see your face
 
 Skipping pebbles on the sea
 Wishing for paradise
 Sand castles crumble below
 The restless tides ebb and flow
 
 Listening to a shell
 Hoping for your voice
 Beautiful Maria of my soul
 
 Though we'll always be apart
 Locked forever in a dream
 If I ever love again
 Even then, nothing will change
 
 And the taste of you remains
 Clinging to paradise
 But as the distance from you grows
 All that my heart ever knows
 Hunger for your kiss
 Longing for your touch
 Beautiful Maria of my soul
 
 Filling all my nights
 Haunting all my days
 Beautiful Maria of my soul
 
 I had a hard run, 
 Running from your window. 
 I was all night running. 
 I wonder if you care? 
 I had a run-in, 
 Run around and run down. 
 Run around a corner, 
 Run smack into a tree.
 
 I had to move, 
 Really had to move. 
 That's why if you please, 
 I am on my bended knees. 
 Bertha don't you come around here anymore. 
 
 Dressed myself in green, 
 I went down to the sea. 
 Try to see what's going down, 
 Maybe read between the lines. 
 Had a feeling I was falling, 
 Turned around to see. 
 Heard a voice calling, 
 You was comin after me. 
 
 I had to move, 
 Really had to move. 
 That's why if you please, 
 I am on my bended knees. 
 Bertha don't you come around here anymore. 
 
 Ran into a rainstorm, 
 Ducked into a bar door. 
 It was all night pouring, 
 But not a drop on me. 
 Test me, test me. 
 Why don't you arrest me? 
 Throw me in the jail house, 
 Until the sun goes down. 
 Till it go down. 
 
 I had to move, 
 Really had to move. 
 That's why if you please, 
 I am on my bended knees. 
 Bertha don't you come around here anymore.
 
 Black is black
 I want my baby back
 It's gray, it's gray
 Since she went away, Ooh-Ooh
 What can I do
 'Cause I-I-I-I-I'm feelin' blue
 
 If I had my way
 She'd be back today
 But she don't intend
 To see me again, Ooh-Ooh
 What can I do
 'Cause I-I-I-I-I'm feelin' blue
 
 I can't choose
 It's too much to lose
 My love's too strong
 Wow! Maybe if she
 would come back to me
 Then it can't go wrong
 
 Bad is bad
 That I feel so sad
 It's time, it's time
 That I found peace of mind, Ooh-Ooh
 What can I do
 'Cause I-I-I-I-I'm feelin' blue
 
 I can't choose
 It's too much to lose
 My love's too strong
 Wow! Maybe if she
 would come back to me
 Then it can't go wrong
 
 Black is black
 I want my baby back
 It's gray, it's gray
 Since she went away, Ooh-Ooh
 What can I do
 'Cause I-I-I-I-I'm feelin' blue
 'Cause I-I-I-I-I'm feelin' blue
 
 A hundred days and a thousand nights
 In just one minute in the blue moonlight
 Since you've gone away I hardly sleep
 Since you left me girl, my heart can't find no peace
 No peace
 
 I was a man who stood strong and tall
 Who could always run and never fall
 Now I barely stand on my two feet
 Maybe this could be my lonely destiny
 Destiny
 
 Can't figure out what's right or wrong
 Don't know where this broken heart belongs
 Belongs
 
 Can't figure out what's right or wrong
 Don't know where this broken heart belongs
 Belongs
 
 A hundred days and a thousand nights
 In just one minute in the blue moonlight
 Travelled through this life without a home
 On these streets where I've been left to roam
 To roam
 To roam
 
 I didn't say a word
 It's only destiny I heard
 The time had come for me to run away
 "Don't even turn around" is what they say
 
 I couldn't say a word
 It's only dignity I heard
 But once I go, there is no coming back
 Throw away all that I one time had
 
 I'll burn it down
 Gonna burn it down
 Gonna burn it down
 
 Had tied me up and I couldn't breathe
 I cut the rope and then I broke free
 Whatever was left I threw it down into the dirt
 And kicked the dust until my damned eyes hurt
 
 I'll burn it down
 Gonna burn it down
 Gonna burn it all down
 
 I couldn't say one word
 It's just mystery I heard
 Maybe I'll miss it on some lonely day
 And maybe think about what I might say
 
 I'll burn it down
 'Til it's gone gone gone
 Gonna burn it all down
 
 Well, buzz, buzz, buzz goes the bumble bee
 Tweele, deedle, dee goes the bird
 But the sound of your little voice, darling
 Is the sweetest sound I've ever heard
 
 I've seen the beauty of the red, red rose
 Seen the beauty when the sky is blue
 Seen the beauty of the evening sunset
 But the beauty of you
 Sweet as the honey from the honeycomb
 Sweet are the grapes from the vine
 But there's nothing as sweet as you, darling
 And I hope someday you'll be mine
 
 Well, buzz, buzz, buzz goes the bumble bee
 Tweele, deedle, dee goes the bird
 But the sound of your little voice, darling
 Is the sweetest sound I've ever heard
 
 I've seen the beauty of the red, red rose
 Seen the beauty when the sky is blue
 Seen the beauty of the evening sunset
 But the beauty of you
 Sweet as the honey from the honeycomb
 Sweet are the grapes from the vine
 But there's nothing as sweet as you, darling
 And I hope someday you'll be mine
 Hope someday you'll be mine
 Hope someday you'll be mine
 Hope someday you'll be mine
 
 What's the use in trying
 She'll never compromise
 She's putting out the fire
 Heart's as cold as ice
 
 I know she's out there running
 With another man
 That woman never learns
 She'll never understand
 
 I can't stop the rain
 Can't stop the rain from falling down
 
 She's got me in a trance
 A mojo's in the work
 A pitted little soul
 I ain't nothin' but a jerk
 
 I fell for her compassion
 It hit me like a bomb
 And now I'm counting pennies
 I ain't nothin' but a bum
 
 But I can't stop the rain
 Can't stop the rain from falling down
 Can't stop the rain
 Can't stop the rain from falling down
 Never stop the rain
 
 So here I sit up crying
 Ain't nothin' but the blues
 Rememberin' sweet little nothings
 She made me so amused
 
 I can't stop the rain
 Can't stop the rain from falling down
 I can't stop the rain
 Can't stop the rain from falling down
 
 I can't stop the rain
 Can't stop the rain
 Can't stop the rain
 Can't stop the rain
 
 Soy un hombre muy honrado
 Que me gusta lo mejor
 Las mujeres no me faltan, ni el dinero, ni el amor
 
 Jineteando en mi caballo
 Por la sierra yo me voy
 Las estrellas y la luna, ellas me dicen donde voy
 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay
 Ay, ay mi amor
 Ay mi morena de mi coraz'n
 
 Me gusta tocar la guitarra
 Me gusta cantar el sol
 Mariachi me acompa'a cuando canto mi canci'n
 
 Me gusta tomar mis copas
 Aguardiente es lo mejor
 Tambi'n el tequila blanco con su sal le da sabor
 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay
 Ay, ay mi amor
 Ay mi morena de mi coraz'n
 
 Me gusta tocar la guitarra
 Me gusta cantar el sol
 El mariachi me acompa'a cuando canto mi canci'n
 
 Me gusta tomar mis copas
 Aguardiente es lo mejor
 Tambi'n el tequila blanco con su sal le da sabor
 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay
 Ay, ay mi amor
 Ay mi morena de mi coraz'n
 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay
 Ay, ay mi amor
 Ay mi morena de mi coraz'n
 
 I'm a prisoner here 
 By your design 
 And the key to the door 
 Oh I can't find 
 
 Closin' in here, baby 
 Are these four walls 
 Not even a dime will you give me 
 To make my one call 
 
 I don't know 
 What a man's suppose to do 
 When the joy is gone 
 Gone away from you 
 
 Ain't no hammer, ain't no rock 
 Can break the lock on these chains 
 These chains of love 
 
 I drag down the boulevard 
 This ball of steel 
 And the ties that bind me 
 Girl, are all too real 
 
 I gotta go free 
 Like a bird up in the air 
 Like a child in the school yard 
 Without a care 
 
 Ain't no hammer, ain't no rock 
 Can break the lock on these chains 
 Ain't no spell none I can tell 
 Can take away these chains 
 Ain't no how to get out 
 Outta these chains of love 
 These chains of love 
 
 Look at the clock 
 So much time 
 I Look again 
 And the hands are stopped 
 
 My mouth is dry 
 My head is hot 
 Somebody tell me just what is this thing I've got 
 
 Doctor Doctor 
 Help me please 
 This spell has got me dropped down to my knees 
 
 Talkin' 'bout charmed baby 
 Talkin' 'bout charmed baby 
 Talkin' 'bout charmed baby 
 Talkin' 'bout charmed baby 
 
 Must be a potion 
 Gotta be a pill 
 Gotta be somethin' that can cure me of these chills 
 
 Doctor help me 
 What do you say 
 "There ain't nothin' that can make this go away" 
 
 What big eyes you have
 What big lips you have
 What a nice hat
 I love you
 
 What you said?
 I can't hear you
 What you said?
 What you said?
 
 Do the colossal head
 
 What you said?
 What you said?
 
 Do the colossal head
 
 Well, come on let's go, let's go, let's go little darlin'
 Tell me that you'll never leave me
 Come on, come on, let's go again and again and again and again
 
 Well, now swing me, swing me, swing me all the way darling

 Let's go, let's go again once more

 It's been a long and lonely, lonely year
 Since the last time I saw you my dear
 Don't you remember when I was in my surrender
 I said I'd always love you endlessly
 
 Hey little sweetheart, so how you doing now?
 I thought without me you probably would drown
 I guess I was wrong and for that it's so long
 Take care my darling, I hope to see you around
 
 Parting with you, I'll never ever get
 Our love can be here and instantly regret
 You showed me love, you gave me understanding
 Living without you, it's going to leave me shredded
 
 It's been a long and lonely, lonely year
 Since the last time I saw you my dear
 Don't you remember when I was in my surrender
 I said I'd always love you endlessly
 I said I'd always love you endlessly
 I said I'd always love you endlessly

 There's a deep dark hole, and it leads to nowhere                              
 There's a deep dark hole, and it leads to nowhere
 Better step aside, better take care	
 Keep an eye out and beware         
 There's a deep dark hole and it leads to nowhere
 It'll spin you around and keep you down
 Tie your feet right to the ground
 Cause it's got no soul, just a big black hole          
 It'll mix you up and leave you out cold
 
 Standin' there by the window
 Starin' out at the night
 You've got so many troubles
 On your nervous mind
 But don't worry baby
 It's gonna work out fine
 
 You hear the sound of footsteps
 Stealing 'cross the floor
 You picked up the receiver
 You didn't know what for
 Then you saw the shadow
 Steppin' through the door
 
 Well don't worry baby
 What the world may bring
 Well don't worry baby
 It won't change a thing
 Life is a fly
 And then you die
 
 Standin' near by the window
 Starin' out at the night
 You see your lover leanin'
 Against the old street light
 But don't worry baby
 It's gonna be alright
 
 He was tossin' and turnin'
 And he couldn't sleep
 It ain't sure to bother
 And it was just a dream
 So where was he goin'
 Headin' down the street
 
 Well don't worry baby
 What the world may bring
 Well don't worry baby
 It won't change a thing
 Life is a fly
 And then you die, hey yeah
 
 Oo yeah sweet mystery 
 Strung together along a wire 
 But then it breaks, why I don't know 
 What is there to do 
 When this thing's done gone blue 
 
 Oo yeah sweet majesty 
 Diamond studded in the mire 
 Oh how it shines, 'till the end of time 
 How is it for you 
 When this thing's done gone blue 
 
 Oo yeah sweet agony 
 When the last coal's in the fire 
 How long it burns, well I don't know 
 Whatcha gonna do 
 When this thing's done gone blue 
 This thing's done gone blue 
 This thing's done gone blue
 
 Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna
 Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna
 
 I had a girl
 Donna was her name
 Since she left me
 I've never been the same
 Cause I love my girl
 Donna, where can you be? Where can you be?
 
 Now that you're gone
 I'm left all alone
 All by myself
 To wander and roam
 Cause I love my girl
 Donna, where can you be? Where can you be?
 
 Well, darlin', now that you're gone
 I don't know what I'll do
 All the time and all my love for you
 
 Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna
 Oh, Donna, Oh, Donna
 
 Down on the riverbed
 Down on the riverbed
 Down on the riverbed
 I asked my lover for her hand
 A red tailed hawk circled overhead
 A red tailed hawk circled overhead
 A red tailed hawk circled overhead
 The church on the hill, was what she said
 A monster cloud like a big black hen
 A monster cloud like a big black hen
 A monster cloud like a big black hen
 As she drew houses in the sand
 Down on the riverbed
 Down on the riverbed
 Down on the riverbed
 I asked my lover for her hand
 I asked my lover for her hand
 Then I heard a train whistle blow
 Then I heard a train whistle blow
 Then I heard a train whistle blow
 And I knew it was time to go
 Down on the riverbed
 Down on the riverbed
 Down on the riverbed
 I asked my lover for her hand
 I asked my lover for her hand
 I asked my lover for her hand
 I asked my lover for her hand
 
 Peaked inside a open door
 Looked around, don't know what for
 Way too bright, could hardly see
 Oh no, can't believe it
 Oh yeah, could almost see it
 In a dream in blue
 
 I flew around with shiny things
 When I spoke I seemed to sing
 High above, floating far away
 Oh no, can't believe it
 Oh yeah, could almost see it
 In a dream in blue
 In a dream in blue
 Sock it to me one time
 
 Woke up laughing in my bed
 Silly smile stuck on my head
 Am I real or still in a dream
 Oh no, can't believe it
 Oh yeah, could almost see it
 Oh no, can't believe it
 Oh yeah, could almost feel it
 In a dream in blue
 In a dream in blue
 
 Emily, take me 'cross the water home
 Emily, look how much we have grown
 Emily, I still remember the day
 Waking up, chasing the shadows away
 It won't be long 'til I see your face
 Eyes as bright as the sun
 It won't be far down this lonesome road
 'Til I see you again
 
 Emily, run so fast through the fields
 Make believe, all our dreams were so real
 It won't be long 'til I see you smile
 Turning my night into day
 It won't be far down this lonely way
 'Til I can hold you again
 
 Emily we can hide, hide from them all
 Emily, they can't catch us
 They can't catch us now
 They can't catch us now
 They can't catch us now
 
 Estoy sentado aqui, que me pasan la tequila
 El amor y triste vida no me importa a mi
 Ahora pienso enboracharme pa quitarme este coraje
 La mujer que yo queria me dejo a mi
 
 Estoy sentado aqui, y con sentimiento espero
 Y parese que me muero por estar sin ti
 Que tristesa me acompa'a
 Le hace falta al corazon la ternura de tu
 Amor que tu vida me dio
 
 Estoy sentado aqui, y con sentimiento espero
 Ya parese que me muero por estar sin ti
 Que tristesa me acompa'a
 Le hace falta al corazon la ternura de tu
 Amor que tu vida me dio
 Estoy sentado aqui
 
 Evangeline is on the roam 
 Just barely seventeen 
 When she left home 
 Don't know where she is 
 Or where she's going 
 She is the queen of make believe, Evangeline 
 
 I can still remember this little girl 
 Black eyes just staring 
 At this big old world 
 Ran off to find some American dream 
 Train ticket in one hand 
 In her new blue jeans 
 
 Evangeline is on the roam 
 Just barely seventeen 
 When she left home 
 Don't know where she is 
 Or where she's going 
 She is the queen of make believe, Evangeline 
 
 She went out dancin' on a Saturday night 
 Silk stockings and high heels 
 Blue liner on her eyes 
 But on Sunday morning she's all alone 
 Head lying on the nightstand 
 By the telephone 
 
 Evangeline is on the roam 
 Just barely seventeen 
 When she left home 
 Don't know where she is 
 Or where she's going 
 She is the queen of make believe, Evangeline 
 She is the queen of make believe, Evangeline
 
 A long time down away on East side, South side
 Los Angeles, Detroit, America, U.S.A.
 Sittin' right about here watchin' high heels
 And sneakers tread concrete platform headin' straight
 For who knows where and why and how come
 
 Clack, clack, clack
 Goin' down the rails and comin' back
 Train a comin' goin'
 Clack, clack, clack
 Clack, clack, clack
 
 I'm thinkin' in sick brain
 "Say man, where you goin' with all those stories
 Wrapped up in suitcase and handbags and old rags?"
 Says, "I can't say, but the 12:40's got my name"
 Well, it goes without sayin', everybody loves a train
 
 Steel whistle blowin' a crazy sound
 Jump on a car when she comes around
 Steel whistle blowin' a crazy sound
 Jump on a car when she comes around
 
 Clack, clack, clack
 Goin' down the rails and comin' back
 Train a comin' goin'
 Clack, clack, clack
 Clack, clack, clack
 
 Just goes without saying
 That everybody loves a train
 Go ahead and call us insane
 But we all just love a train
 
 Go ahead
 
 Shake your shoes off and let loose your feet 
 Go on out and take it to the street 
 It don't matter, let 'em all come see

 Maybe brown or round or short or tall 
 Let's have us a real good time 
 Don't wait long 
 To get to this

 Go outside and give 'em all a shout 
 Let 'em know what it's all about

 We may be brown 'n round or six feet tall 
 Gonna have us a real good time

 To get to this 
 Come on baby 
 Get on down to this
 
 There's a tattoo heart
 With an arrow through the middle
 Of a name that looks like Joe
 And a young girl's looking
 At her makeup in the mirror
 Puts a little gold ring on her toe
 
 I gotta say one, two, three
 More things before I go on
 
 There's a sharp dressed man
 Playing something on a fiddle
 In the backyard right next door
 And everybody's mother
 Is cooking something in the kitchen
 Got dishes stacked ceiling to floor
 
 I gotta say one, two, three
 More things before I go on
 
 You can't run and try to hide away
 Here it comes, here comes another day
 
 A red rooster crows
 A little Mexican tune
 On the chain link fence by the gate
 Somebody's daddy's out there
 Honkin' on the horn
 Hurry up, we're gonna make him late
 
 I gotta say one, two, three
 More things before I go on
 
 You can't run and try to hide away
 Here it comes, here comes another day
 If you're long down that highway
 No matter where you are
 You're never really far
 Good morning Aztlan
 
 There's a big fat heart
 With an arrow through the middle
 Of this place that I call home
 And when I get lost
 And don't even got a nickel
 There's a piece of dirt I call my own
 
 I gotta say one, two, three
 More things before I go on
 
 You can't run and try to hide away
 Here it comes, here comes another day
 You can't run to try to hide away
 Here it comes, here comes another day
 Where you are, never really far away
 Good morning Aztlan
 
 Yo soy un hombre sincero
 De donde crecen las palmas
 Yo soy un hombre sincero
 De donde crecen las palmas
 Y antes de morirme quiero
 Echar mis versos del alma
 
 Guantanamera
 Guajira Guantanamera
 Guantanamera
 Guajira Guantanamera
 
 Mi verso es de un verde claro
 Y de un carmin encendido
 Mi verso es de un verde claro
 Y de un carmin encendido
 Mi verso es un ciervo herido
 Que busca en el monte amparo
 
 Cultivo la rosa blanca
 En junio como en enero
 Qultivo la rosa blanca
 En junio como en enero
 Para el amigo sincero
 Que me da su mano franca
 
 Y para el cruel que me arranca
 El corazon con que vivo
 Y para el cruel que me arranca
 El corazon con que vivo
 Cardo ni ortiga cultivo
 Cultivo la rosa blanca
 
 Con los pobres de la tierra
 Quiero yo mi suerte echar
 Con los pobres de la tierra
 Quiero yo mi suerte echar
 El arroyo de la sierra
 Me complace mas que el mar
 
 I travel down this lonely road
 To see if I can pick me a rose
 But all I find is a handful of thorns
 In a place where blossoms should grow
 
 Some hearts are made of stone
 Some are cold, made of ice
 Some beat all alone
 Then there's those made of steel
 Ones that don't even feel
 Where are those hearts
 Those hearts made of gold
 
 I wandered down this lonely trail
 Some twenty seven hours a day
 But all I see are prints in the dirt
 Where others tried to find their way
 
 How far will I go
 To leave these fears behind
 Oh, let those tears go dry
 Yeah, won't stop until I can find
 Oh, that heart of gold
 
 The advantage of being in high places
 Is that you never have to look up
 
 The advantage of being in high places
 Is that you never have to look up
 
 And you feel like a big shot
 It makes you feel like a big shot
 It makes you feel like a big shot
 Makes you feel like a real big shot
 
 The advantage of being in high places
 Is that people look so small
 
 The advantage of being in high places
 Is that people look so small
 
 And you feel like a big shot
 It makes you feel like a big shot
 It makes you feel like a big shot
 Makes you feel like a real big shot
 
 The trouble with being in high places
 Is when you fall it's a long way down
 
 The trouble with being in high places
 Is when you fall it's a long way down
 
 The trouble with being in high places
 The trouble with being in high places
 The trouble with being in high places
 
 The trouble with being in high places
 Is when you're down nobody picks you up
 
 The trouble with being in high places
 Is when you're down nobody picks you up
 
 Cuz you acted like a big shot
 So what happened to the big shot
 So what happened to the big shot
 You thunk you were a real big shot
 
 The trouble with being in high places
 The trouble with being in high places
 The trouble with being in high places
 The trouble with being in high places
 
 Hold on
 Hold on to every breath
 And if I make it to the sunrise
 Do it all over again
 Do it all over again
 
 And I'm killing myself
 Just to keep alive
 Killing myself to survive
 Killing myself to survive
 
 Every night, I stare this thing down
 Knowing that you'll win in the end
 There's blood on a rag, only dust in the bag
 Thought you said you were my friend
 
 And I'll hold on
 Hold on to every breath
 And if I make it to the sunrise
 Do it all over again
 I'll do it all over again
 
 Now I'm killing myself
 Just to keep alive
 Killing myself to survive
 Killing myself to survive
 Killing myself to survive
 I'm killing myself to survive
 
 Now, hold on
 Hold on to every breath
 
 Every day, watch the sun go down
 Telling myself a big lie
 Can I say I'll go another day
 Or will this be the time that I die?
 
 And I'll hold on
 Hold on to every breath
 And if I make it to the sunrise
 Do it all over again
 Do it all over again
 
 Killing myself just to keep alive
 Killing myself to survive
 Killing myself to survive
 Killing myself to survive
 Killing myself to survive
 
 All avenues lead to one
 Baby you can walk or run
 Get there first or next or last, it don't matter
 
 Take it slow or take it fast
 You cannot overtake your past
 Can't hurry up tomorrow, let it come
 
 Hurry up tomorrow, I don't know
 Where love's gone or where it still may go
 I can see the raindrops roll
 Down my bedroom window slow
 Like they're strumming, on the guitar of my soul
 
 Hurry tomorrow
 Hurry up
 
 Hurry up another day
 Let the guitar player play
 Music makes it seem alright while it's playing
 
 Should I stand or should I speak?
 Hold me up my knees are weak
 Dancing cheek to cheek with you
 After midnight
 
 Hurry up tomorrow, I don't know
 Where love's gone or where it still may go
 I can see the raindrops roll
 Down my bedroom window slow
 Like they're strumming, like they're strumming on my soul
 On the heartstrings of my soul ?
 
 Hurry tomorrow
 Hurry up
 
 Hurry up tomorrow, I don't know
 Where love's gone or where it still may go
 I can see the raindrops ? my bedroom window slow
 Like they're strumming, like they're strumming, on my soul
 
 Hurry tomorrow
 Hurry it slow
 Hurry tomorrow, oh yeah
 
 Love you baby with all my might
 God knows I tried to treat you right
 Begging you baby let me be your slave
 But please don't send me to an early grave
 
 Well I can't understand, why did you let me go?
 I've done all I could, I can't do much more
 
 There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you
 You want my life, you can have that too!
 Please use my blood to mark my grave
 Let the whole word know that I died your slave
 
 Well I can't understand, why did you let me go?
 I've done all I could, I can't do much more
 Play brothers
 
 I thought you loved you baby, I changed my life
 Wanted you to be my woman and wife
 Now bloodshot tears have blinded my eyes
 I'm too weak to live, I'm too strong to die
 
 Well I can't understand, why did you let me go?
 I've done all I could, I can't do much more
 
 I've done all I could, I can't do much more
 I've done all I could, I can't do no more
 
 Can't understand, you let me go, baby?
 
 Last night I got loaded 
 On a bottle of gin, on a bottle of gin 
 Last night I got loaded 
 On a bottle of gin, on a bottle of gin 
 But I feel alright, I feel alright 
 I feel alright, I feel alright 
 
 Night before last I got loaded 
 On a bottle of whiskey, on a bottle of whiskey 
 Night before last I got loaded 
 On a bottle of whiskey, on a bottle of whiskey 
 But I feel alright, I feel alright 
 I feel alright, I feel alright 
 
 Tonight I might get loaded 
 On a bottle of wine, on a bottle of wine 
 Tonight I might get loaded 
 On a bottle of wine, on a bottle of wine 
 But I feel alright, I feel alright 
 I feel alright, I feel alright
 
 You know your love for me 
 Has given me a thrill 
 And I just can't stand still 
 Pretty mama, you know I love you so 
 Cause I love you and I want you, baby

 Has set me off my feet

 I'll walk alone if I can't walk with you
 I'll walk alone if I can't walk with you
 I don't want nobody else, nobody else will do
 
 Life is too precious to live alone
 Life is too precious to live alone
 A house without love is not a home
 
 I close my eyes and hold you tight
 I close my eyes and hold you tight
 It's a dream I have about every night
 
 I'll walk alone if I can't walk with you
 I'll walk alone if I can't walk with you
 I don't want nobody else, nobody else will do
 
 I'm gonna be a wheel someday
 I'm gonna be somebody
 I'm gonna be a real gone cat
 Then I won't want you
 
 Everything's going to roll my way
 I won't need nobody
 I'm gonna be a real gone cat
 Then I won't want you
 
 You will cry, cry, cry
 You will sigh, sigh, sigh
 You will wonder why I don't look at you
 When I go rolling by
 
 I'm gonna be a wheel someday
 I'm gonna be somebody
 I'm gonna be a real gone cat
 Then I won't want you
 
 I'm gonna be a wheel someday
 I'm gonna be somebody
 I'm gonna be a real gone cat
 Then I won't want you
 
 Everything's going to roll my way
 I won't need nobody
 I'm gonna be a real gone cat
 Then I won't want you
 
 You will cry, cry, cry
 You will sigh, sigh, sigh
 You will wonder why I don't look at you
 When I go rolling by
 
 I'm gonna be a wheel someday
 I'm gonna be somebody
 I'm gonna be a real gone cat
 
 Climbing high to the mountain top 
 Reaching up to the sky above 
 Asking to myself 
 Is this all there is? 
 
 Sailing into the ocean blue 
 Trying to find at least one clue 
 On a paper scrawled 
 Is this all there is? 
 
 And they all came to talk about it 
 The came to cry and laugh and fight about it 
 All searching for the promised land 
 Tired souls with empty hands 
 Asking to themselves 
 Is this all there is? 
 
 Fifteen years on a sewing machine 
 Where twisted hands don't mean a thing 
 Wondering to herself 
 Is this all there is? 
 
 Baby crying in an old tin cup 
 Wanting more but there's never enough 
 While her mother sighs 
 Is this all there is?
 
 Hey hey hey, my my my
 Hey hey hey, my my my
 Jenny's got a pony so that jenny can ride

 Jenny's got a pony so that jenny can ride
 
 One for my mother, one for my sister sue
 One for my brother and one for my father too
 Pony can run, pony can jump so high
 Jenny's got a pony so that Jenny can ride
 
 Jenny can ride, ride Jenny ride
 Jenny can ride, ride Jenny ride
 Jenny's got a pony so that Jenny can ride
 Jenny's got a pony so that Jenny can ride

 Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month
 Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none
 He came home too drunk from mixin'Tanqueray and wine
 He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call'm Johnny 99
 
 Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you don't stop
 Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top
 When an off duty cop snuck up on him from behind
 Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99
 
 Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown
 He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down
 Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime
 Prison for 98 and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99
 
 A fistfight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away
 His mama stood up and shouted "Judge don't take my boy this way"
 Well son you got a statement you'd like to make
 Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away
 
 Now judge judge I had debts no honest man could pay
 The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they was takin' my house away
 Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man
 But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand
 
 Well your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead
 And if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head
 Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time
 And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that execution line
 
 If I could
 Turn night into day
 You know I would
 
 If I could
 Make stone into gold
 You know I would
 
 Look for why
 Up in the sky
 Where have you gone
 Gone so soon?
 Ask Jupiter or the moon
 
 If I could
 Move clouds from the blue
 You know I would
 
 If I could
 Make this day last
 You know I would
 
 A quiet sigh
 At morning light
 Where did you go
 Go so soon?
 Wake Jupiter or the moon
 
 Talk to me
 Hear me please
 How long is forever?
 Tell me Jupiter or the moon
 
 Gazing up
 Into the dark
 If you could
 If you would
 You should just
 Talk to me
 Hear me please
 How long is forever?
 
 Just a man, made of blood and bone
 Thrown away, all that was once my own
 
 Old and worn, and tired too
 Of cold so cold, and blue so blue
 
 Endless love, washed away in the sand
 Too much to lose, for just a man
 
 In my time, never had my fill
 Of broken hearts, for just a thrill
 
 Letting my love, run through my hands
 Too much to lose, for just a man
 
 Don't put too many
 Cards on this hard-headed man
 Take whatever is yours
 And get as far away as you can
 
 No grey clouds, lined with silver and gold
 No little boy, to watch me grow old
 
 I play the game, as I know I can
 So much to lose, for just a man
 
 So much to ache, so much to break
 Too much at stake
 
 Kiko and the lavender moon
 Out playing, makes believe
 Nobody can see
 And then he waits
 And then he fakes
 And then he bends
 And then he shakes
 He plays and plays
 Still playing till he
 Goes off to sleep
 
 Kiko and the lavender moon
 Out dancing making faces at
 A big black cat
 And then he flies
 Up to the wall
 Stands on one foot
 Doesn't even fall
 Dance and dance
 Still dancing till
 He goes off to sleep
 
 He always sleeps
 Till the sun goes down
 He never wakes
 Till no one's around
 He never stops
 Can't catch his breath
 It's always there
 Scares him to death
 
 Kiko and the lavender moon
 Out dreaming 'bout green shoes
 Haircuts and cake
 And then he wishes
 The world away
 And then he kneels
 As if to pray
 He dreams and dreams
 Kiko and the lavender moon
 
 Para bailar la bamba
 Para bailar la bamba se necesita una poca de gracia
 Una poca de gracia pa' mi pa' ti y arriba y arriba

 No se como decirte
 No se como explicarte
 Que aqu' no hay remedio
 De lo que siento yo
 De lo que siento yo
 
 La luna me dice una cosa
 Las estrellas me dicen otra
 Y la luz del d'a me canta
 Esta triste canci'n
 
 Los besos que me diste mi amor
 Son los que me est'n matando
 Ya las lagrimas me est'n secando
 Con mi pistola y mi coraz'n
 Y aqu' siempre paso la vida con
 La pistola y el coraz'n
 
 No se como amarte
 No se como abrazarte
 Porque no se me deja
 Este dolor que tengo yo
 El dolor que tengo yo
 
 Esta noche tan oscura con sus
 Sombras tan tranquilos
 Y el viento me sigue cantando
 Esta humilde canci'n
 
 Los besos que me diste mi amor
 Son los que me est'n matando
 Ya las lagrimas me est'n secando
 Con mi pistola y mi coraz'n
 Y aqu' siempre paso la vida con
 La pistola y el coraz'n
 
 Vamos a la playa 
 Con Rosita, Sandra y Juan 
 Vamos a la playa 
 Con Rosita, Sandra y Juan 
 Aunque la agua sera fria 
 Vamos a tener mucho fun

 La isla de la mujer

 La isla de la mujer 
 Alli podemos correr desnudos 
 
 Porque nadie nos puede ver 
 Alli podemos correr desnudos 
 
 Porque nadie nos puede ver 
 
 Vamos a la playa

 If I say yes, I'm sure you'll say no
 If I say stop I know you'll say go
 What seems to be the problem here is you and me
 'Cause we just can't agree
 So let's just say goodnight and go home
 
 You're always right, and I have never been wrong
 The way we are it's getting harder to hang on
 But who's to blame, when two things are
 Never the same, it's not people that change
 It's maybe living from day to day
 
 What can I say, the Lord just made us this way
 What can I do you know what I've been through
 It's just this world, it makes it hard for a guy and girl
 But we could give it a whirl
 So let's just say goodnight and go home
 
 I get happy 'cause my life is good
 I get laughin' 'cause I know I should
 I get all happy 'cause my life is good, so good
 
 And I go
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 
 I get happy 'cause my life is good
 Turnin' out just like I thought it would
 I get all happy 'cause my life is so dang good
 
 And I go
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 
 I get all happy 'cause my life is so damn good
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm
 Ooh la la mm

 And I go

 Standin' on my front porch
 Grabbed her and I kissed her
 Boy I was surprised when I saw her little sister
 
 Lights out, lights out
 I'm glad now the lights were out
 Sister knows more about
 What to do when the lights go out
 
 Mother looked at me
 She was a-peepin' through the window
 The way she looked at me
 Boy, I thought I was a sinner
 
 Lights out, lights out
 I'm glad now the lights were out
 Sister knows more about
 What to do when the lights go out
 
 Lovin' on the front porch sittin' on the swing
 I can almost hear those weddin' bells ring
 
 Lights out, lights out
 I'm glad now the lights were out
 Sister knows more about
 What to do when the lights go out
 
 Lovin' on the front porch sittin' on the swing
 I can almost hear those weddin' bells ring
 
 Lights out, lights out
 I'm glad now the lights were out
 Sister knows more about
 What to do when the lights go out
 
 Now we're married and we bought a little house
 Would have married little sister, but the lights went out
 
 Lights out, lights out
 I'm glad now the lights were out
 Sister knows more about
 What to do when the lights go out
 
 Alone at night with sleepless eyes
 The starlit sky don't seem to mind
 A candle's burnin' a hundred years
 Like a baby cryin' a thousand tears
 
 But it's been so long
 And the days go on and on
 
 A town is sleepin' across the sea
 In a land that's only a memory
 A red sun's risin' as if to say
 "Don't ever leave me, don't go away"
 
 But I gotta be strong
 As time goes on and on
 
 What can I do in dreams so blue
 Where I see you
 My little Japan, my little Japan
 
 Morning's comin' through evening's rest
 I've tried my hardest, I've done my best
 Is it right to say to you
 What my spirit's calling for me to do?
 
 But I can't be wrong
 I gotta go on and on
 
 Along the way, I'll hope and pray
 I can see the day
 I could be with you, my little Japan
 I can be with you
 
 He can't run
 He can't play
 He does things in a different way
 Little John, Little John of God
 
 He tries to speak but no one hears
 A little boy's pains and a little boy's fears
 Little John, Little John of God
 
 He's come to us from up above
 To touch our hearts with special love
 With special love, Little John of God
 
 You can say with your eyes
 What others only say inside
 Little John, Little John of God
 Little John, Little John of God
 
 Cuando you and me 
 We were just chiquillos 
 We would always run 
 Through the tall nopal 
 We would often say 
 Say to each other 
 There could be no fin 
 Siempre los dos 
 
 Luz de mi vida 
 Eres la voz de mi son 
 You are forever 
 Light of my coraz'n 
 
 It was en la ma'ana 
 In our rinconcito 
 Was the time you played me 
 Sang me your canci'n 
 Pues when I heard your voice 
 Y tu melodia 
 You so touched my heart 
 And so moved my soul 
 
 Luz de mi vida 
 Eres la voz de mi son 
 You are forever 
 Light of my coraz'n 
 
 I remember everything as you 
 And in all the things that I do 
 And en the calle y en el cuartel 
 Me recuerdo de tu querer 
 
 Luz de mi vida 
 Eres la voz de mi son 
 
 I remember everything as you 
 And in all the things that I do 
 And en the calle y en el cuartel 
 Me recuerdo de tu querer
 
 Tell me please Dear Malaque
 Why have our loved ones gone away
 Left with nothing much to say
 Only the warm place where they lay
 On the way to the ruby king
 
 Malaque what do we do
 Now there's only me and you
 Can we begin our lives anew
 After all that we've been through
 On this day of the ruby king
 
 We have worked so hard to find
 What is yours and what is mine
 How does one become so blind
 And forget what is divine
 In the world of the ruby king
 
 Malaque oh Malaque
 Where have our friends all gone today
 Gone without a word to say
 Only the beds where they once laid
 Left to rest with the ruby king
 Gone away to the ruby king
 
 On the day Manuel went and died
 The men all laughed and the girls did cry
 Now it's time to lay his soul to rest
 Do him up in his Sunday best, oh my
 
 Manny's dead and didn't leave me none
 Went off to heaven, left his bed undone
 Gone away, he didn't leave a cent
 The dogs are all wonderin' where their daddy went, oh my
 
 Don't go leave me here by myself
 Won't hear me callin' when you've all done left
 Guess I didn't make it out this time
 But I'll be waitin' on the other side, bye bye
 
 Way down in Manny's bones
 A dry old river and a dusty soul
 We'll take him down to the fishin' hole
 And let the water take him to his home
 
 Way down in Manny's bones
 A dry old river and a dusty soul
 We'll take him down to the fishin' hole
 And let the water take him to his home
 
 Way down in Manny's bones
 Way down in Manny's bones

 Oh, baby
 Girl, don't pull the rug from under my feet
 Don't do it baby
 Don't leave, don't leave me so
 I'm talking in my sleep
 
 This could be the start of a nightmare
 Waking up and not finding you there
 It would be more than I could stand
 
 Oh, baby
 Girl, don't leave me so I'm pacing the floor
 Don't do it baby
 'Cause that's, that's what I'll do
 If you close the door, yeah
 
 Maybe I've been too hung up on myself
 But don't change me by putting my heart on a shelf
 It would be more than I could stand, listen baby
 
 Why you wanna leave me? Why you wanna go?
 I promise not to never hurt you, no more
 Please don't leave me, please don't go
 It's causin' my heart to ache, causin' it to break
 
 We, we've still got a love
 Got of love to give, yeah
 So turn around, baby, turn around
 While there's a lot of life to live
 
 Leavin' me would ruin all of my plans
 It would be like tying the both of my hands
 And that is more baby than I could stand, yeah
 
 Why you wanna leave me? Why you wanna go?
 I promise not, never hurt you, no more
 Please don't leave me, please don't go
 I promise not, never, never hurt you, no more
 
 Please don't leave me, please don't go
 I promise not, never hurt you, no more
 Please don't leave me, please don't go
 I promise not, never hurt you, no more
 
 Please don't go, baby, please don't leave
 I never, never, I never, never hurt you, no more
 
 Mi corazon y alma estan muy triste, 
 Porque te fuiste a nunca parecer
 Traiciones y mentiras que me hicistes, un dia adelante
 Ya no las vas hacer
 
 Me han dicho que te vieron ya muy triste,
 Que andas pagando con un mal amor
 Te dije que tu eras la culpable, por tus mal hechos
 Ay que tan gran error
 
 Me estoy muriendo, me estoy matando
 Por una ingrata que me hace tanto malo
 Me estoy muriendo, me estoy matando
 Por una ingrata que me hace tanto malo
 
 Juraste que me amabas con tu alma, esas promesas
 Nunca te las crei
 Porque sabia que tu eras ya muy mala, y no me amabas
 Como dijiste a mi
 
 La mujer que te hecha la mentira, no se confia ni se respetara
 Ya por eso les digo ten cuidado, con las mujeres
 Nunca se jugara
 
 Me estoy muriendo, me estoy matando
 Por una ingrata que me hace tanto malo
 Me estoy muriendo, me estoy matando
 Por una ingrata que me hace tanto malo

 My baby's gone 
 She's gone away from me 
 My baby's gone 
 She's gone away from me 
 Living doesn't matter now 
 She's going to set me free 
 
 Most people say 
 That now I'm free from your spell 
 Most people say 
 That now I'm free from your spell 
 Living on the outside 
 You know it's hard to tell 
 
 Five years relations 
 Went down the drain 
 What does it matter 
 She'll always be the same 
 
 My baby's gone 
 She's gone away from me 
 Crying doesn't matter now 
 She's going to set me free 
 
 She's going away 
 She's going away for good 
 She's going away 
 She's going away for good 
 Crying doesn't matter now 
 It wouldn't do a bit of good 
 
 She's gone away
 
 Zandu cracked the tile
 With a pointed file
 Could be heard for miles
 
 Diamond cut the glass
 Like a blade of grass
 Nothing made to last
 In the halls of Lu
 In the new Zandu
 
 In the halls of Lu
 In the new Zandu
 
 In the halls of Lu
 In the new Zandu
 
 In the halls of Lu
 In the new Zandu
 
 In the halls of Lu
 In the new Zandu
 
 Middle of July 
 Nineteen-eighty-two 
 Standing on a corner 
 With nothing much to do 
 Talking with Cecilia 
 In nineteen-eighty-five 
 Glad to still be breathing 
 Glad to be alive 
 
 Where's all the time 
 Nineteen-ninety-one 
 Change on the dresser 
 Bed is still undone 
 What's a weary man to do 
 In nineteen-ninety-four 
 Hear the front bell ringing 
 But no one's at the door 
 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 
 Who's gonna know 
 When all is said and done 
 That a boy was born to Rita 
 In nineteen-sixty-one 
 And lived a hundred years 
 By nineteen-ninety-six 
 Who's ever gonna notice 
 That it all came down to this 
 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh yeah
 
 On a night like this
 So glad you came around
 Hold on to me so tight
 And heat up some coffee grounds
 We got much to talk about
 And much to reminisce
 It sure is right
 On a night like this
 
 On a night like this
 So glad you've come to stay
 Hold on to me, pretty miss
 Say you'll never go away to stray
 Run your fingers down my spine
 Bring me a touch of bliss
 It sure feels right
 On a night like this
 
 On a night like this
 I can't get any sleep
 The air is so cold outside
 And the snow's so deep
 Build a fire, throw on logs
 And listen to it hiss
 And let it burn, burn, burn, burn
 On a night like this
 
 Put your body next to mine
 And keep me company,
 There is plenty a room for all
 So please don't elbow me
 
 Let the four winds blow
 Around this old cabin door
 If I'm not too far off 
 I think we did this once before
 There's more frost on the window glass
 With each new tender kiss
 But it sure feels right
 On a night like this
 
 Nothing better than walking down the boulevard
 Feeling the sun on my face
 Watching Maggie and Connie with their little kids
 Running 'round all over the place
 
 Got a red light
 Got a green light
 Don't matter which way I go
 
 Down main street
 Down easy street
 It's when I feel like I'm home
 
 Nothing better than strolling down the boulevard
 With a little time on my side
 All worries gone away to somewhere else
 Only with one blink of an eye
 
 Got a red light
 Got a green light
 Don't matter which way I go
 Going home
 The only place I know
 Take me there
 Where the days go slow
 
 Nothing better than running down the boulevard
 Getting a little dirt on my shoes
 With my brothers and sisters hanging all around
 Chasing away all of my blues
 
 A wise man was telling stories to me
 About the places he had been to and the things that he had seen
 
 A quiet voice is singing something to me
 An age old song 'bout the home of the brave in this land here of the free
 One time one night in America
 
 A lady dressed in white with the man she loves
 Standing along the side of their pick up truck
 A shot rang out in the night
 Just when everything seemed right
 Another headline written down in America
 
 The guy that lived next door in three o five
 Took the kids to the park and disappeared 'bout half past nine
 Who will ever know how much she loved them so
 That dark night alone in America
 
 A quiet voice is singing something to me
 An age old song 'bout the brave in this land here of the free
 One time one night in America
 
 Four small boys playing ball in the parking lot
 A preacher, a teacher, and the other became a cop
 A car skidded into the rain
 Making the last little one a saint
 One more light goes out in America
 
 A young girl tosses a coin in the wishing well
 She hopes for a heaven while for her there's just this hell
 She gave away her life to become somebody's wife
 Another wish unanswered in America
 People having so much faith
 Die too soon while all the rest come late
 We write a song that no one sings
 On a cold black stone where a lasting peace will finally bring
 
 The sunlight plays upon my window pane
 I wake up to a world that's still the same
 My father said to be strong
 That a good man could never do wrong
 In a dream I had last night in America
 A wise man was telling stories to me
 About the places he had been to and the things that he had seen
 A quiet voice is singing something to me
 An age old song 'bout the home of the brave in this land here of the free
 One time one night in America
 One time one night in America
 One time one night in America
 
 Now at last the night has fallen 
 We're all alone 
 The sky is dark, the stars are bright 
 And we're so far from home 
 
 You and I have been together 
 For so many years 
 If love is right, why do you fight 
 To hold back needless tears 
 
 Tell me that it'll be alright 
 But when I'm deep inside I realize 
 That this our last night 
 
 Bring your pretty head closer 
 Get it close to mine 
 Your eyes are saying something 
 But the words are hard to find 
 
 Love don't know it lasts forever 
 Ours is here to stay 
 After all the love we've given 
 Please don't look at me that way 
 
 Tell me that it'll be alright 
 But when I'm deep inside I realize 
 That this our last night 
 
 Feelings come and hearts fall broken 
 Slipping through our hands 
 The ways of life and love 
 I'll never never understand 
 
 If it's true what you've been saying 
 If there's still a chance 
 Why is it that the two of us 
 Can't rescue this romance 
 
 Faded love don't ever come back 
 So the story goes 
 There is a side of you and I 
 Where love no longer goes 
 
 Tell me that it'll be alright 
 But when I'm deep inside I realize 
 That this our last night
 
 It was the third of September; that day I'll always remember, 
 'Cause that was the day that my daddy died.
 I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
 Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.
 
 Mama just looked at him and said, "Son, 
 Papa was a rollin' stone.
 Wherever he laid his head was his home.
 And when he died, all he left us was alone."
 
 Papa was a rollin' stone.
 Wherever he laid his head was his home.
 And when he died, all he left us was alone."
 
 Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
 And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
 Papa had three outside children and another wife 
 And that ain't right.
 Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
 Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
 And stealin' in the name of the Lord
 Mama just hung her head and said,
 
 Papa was a rollin' stone.
 Wherever he laid his head was his home.
 And when he died, all he left us was alone."
 
 Papa was a rollin' stone.
 Wherever he laid his head was his home.
 And when he died, all he left us was alone."
 
 Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
 Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
 Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
 Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
 Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
 Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.
 
 Mama just hung her head and said, "Son,
 Papa was a rollin' stone.
 Wherever he laid his head was his home.
 And when he died, all he left us was alone."
 
 Papa was a rollin' stone.
 Wherever he laid his head was his home.
 And when he died, all he left us was alone."
 
 Papa was a rollin' stone.
 Wherever he laid his head was his home.
 And when he died, all he left us was alone."
 
 Papa was a rollin' stone.
 Wherever he laid his head was his home.
 And when he died, all he left us was alone."
 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Peace to the world
 
 I see a baby in a crib
 Reaching up for Mama's arms
 Love is rising in their hearts, oh yeah
 
 There is a man standing on the street
 Shouting loud above the crowd
 Saying amen to everyone around, oh yeah
 
 I see a man who loved his land
 Laying lifeless on the ground
 He said the time is now
 To bring peace to the world
 Say yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Peace to the world
 
 We build a wall of stone
 As high as the trees are tall
 Higher than the mountains
 Stronger than us all, oh yeah
 
 Some day that wall will crumble
 Tumble and fall, the sun will shine
 And bring peace to us all
 Say yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Bring peace to us all
 Bring peace to us all
 
 We build a wall of stone
 As high as the trees are tall
 Higher than the mountains
 Stronger than us all, oh yeah
 Say yeah
 
 Some day that wall will crumble
 Tumble and fall, the sun will shine
 And bring peace to us all
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Peace to us all
 Peace to the world
 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Peace to the world
 
 I see a baby in a crib
 Reaching up for Mama's arms
 Love is rising in their hearts, oh yeah

 Laying lifeless on the ground

 Peace to the world
 
 ?Que hare lejos de ti prenda del alma?
 ?Sin verte, sin oirte why sin hablarte?
 A cada instante intentare de ti acordarme
 
 ?Como quitar la esencia de las flores?
 ?Como quitarle al viento la armonia?
 ?Como negar que te amo, vida mia?
 ?Como borrar de mi alma esta pasion?
 
 Al ver que el cruel destino nos condena
 Mi bien de que me olvidez tengo miedo
 Mi corazon me dice ya no puedo
 No puedo mis angustias soportar
 
 ?Como quitar el brillo a las estrellas?
 ?Como impedir que corra el manso rio?
 ?Como negar que sufrir el pecho mio?
 ?Como borrar de mi alma esta pasion?
 
 Maybe it was the way he walked
 Or the way he combed his hair
 Could have been the fancy words
 Or the sweet wine in the air
 
 Wasn't the muddy shoes she'd hear
 Slow coming up the hall
 Or the faces in the pictures
 That were hanging on the wall
 
 Knock down the door to Reva's house
 There's something going on
 The dogs were barking late last night
 There's something going wrong
 
 Maybe she hoped he'd just go away
 And wake up alone in bed
 Maybe there was no reason
 For the things that he had said
 
 Knock down the door to Reva's house
 There's something going on
 The dogs were barking late last night
 There's something going wrong
 
 Didn't find the matches
 Couldn't light them in the dark
 Could only hear the sound
 Of the breaking of her heart
 
 "Don't know where to run to
 I don't know where to hide
 Can't hold my head up anymore
 Don't listen when I cry"
 
 Knock down the door to Reva's house
 There's something going on
 The dogs were barking late last night
 There's something going wrong
 
 Where did it go?
 Can't say that I know
 Those times of revolution
 Of burnin', burnin', burnin'
 All so cool and gone
 What was, just was
 
 We tried, my brother
 To hold on to our fate
 Or was it late for revolution?
 To tired, too tired, sister
 To hold my fist so high
 Now that it's gone
 
 Too tired brother, sister
 To hold my fist so high
 Now that it's gone
 Gone away.
 
 Where did it go?
 Can we say we know
 Those times of revolution
 Our time of revolution
 
 H'blame R'o de Tenampa
 C'ntame canciones de valor
 En este rinc'n del cielo
 Dejo mi cari'o, mi amor
 
 H'blame R'o de Tenampa
 C'ntame canciones de valor
 En este rinc'n del cielo
 Dejo mi cari'o, mi amor
 
 The radio's on, the song they play
 Can't make no sense of what they say
 I couldn't tell you if I knew
 
 Don't understand most things I see
 In the moonlight of the TV
 I couldn't tell you what to do
 
 Rita it all just seems too much
 And sometimes maybe not enough
 My head is so, so filled up
 
 And Rita, I guess I think too much
 Or maybe sometimes not enough
 My head is always so filled up
 
 I hold the phone close to my ear
 Can't recognize the voice I hear
 Couldn't remember what they said
 
 The newspaper stands upon the stair
 I can't believe how long I slept
 Now why should I get out of bed
 
 Rita it all just seems too much
 And sometimes maybe not enough
 My head is so, so filled up
 
 And Rita I guess I think too much
 Or maybe sometimes not enough
 My head is always so filled up
 
 There was a thing floating way up there
 Was it a wish or another prayer?
 It was stuck, stuck up in the air
 
 Memories of a lonely past
 A boat set into the wind
 Drifting lost in waters of doubt
 On a journey that has no end
 
 Torn and faded photographs
 A chestful of old goodbyes
 Tear streaked faces by the light of the moon
 Here on a river of fools
 Here on a river of fools
 
 A trio of angels holding candles of light
 Guide the ship to an unknown shore
 Sad soul riders with arms drawn tight
 As they stopped for just one more
 
 Fingers pointed to a star in the sky
 A message from someone they can't see
 Tear streaked faces by the light of the moon
 Here on a river of fools
 Here on a river of fools
 
 Traveling along a cloudy path
 With a wing, a heart, and a prayer
 Pieces fall from the heavens above
 To a place they know not where
 
 A string of beads in trembling hands
 Heading close to the judgment day
 Tear streaked faces by the light of the moon
 Here on a river of fools
 Here on a river of fools
 
 Round and round and up and down and round and round and 
 Rollin', rollin' I don't know 
 Never ends and never ever wants to let me go 
 
 When over you comes waves of blue 
 Have no fear 
 Cause I'll be right here beside you 
 
 Round and round and up and down and round and round and 
 Dizzy, dizzy 'till I can't see 
 Stumbling in the dark 
 Reaching out, reaching out 
 For someone to hold me 
 
 I'll be your eyes to give you sight 
 If you fall 
 If you do fall into that night 
 
 Round and round and up and down and round and round and 
 What will I do if I can't see you? 
 I can't touch you 
 I can't even hear you calling my name 
 
 Heart to heart 
 Soul to soul 
 Heart to heart we can't be wrong 
 Soul to soul in this small corner of the earth 
 We can be strong
 
 I would've run away with you
 If I hadn't asked what I should do
 Believe me what I say is true
 I would've run, run away with you
 
 I would've known it from the start
 If I had listened to my heart
 You'll never know but this is true
 I would've run, run away with you
 Run away with you
 
 I was afraid at what they might say
 When I could have turned the other way
 You've got to know this love is true
 And that I would've run, run away with you
 Run away with you
 Run away with you
 Run away with you
 Run away with you
 Run away with you
 Run away with you
 Run away with you
 
 Hammer and a nail
 Hammer and a nail
 Saint behind the glass
 Holds a hammer and a nail
 
 Baby in his arms
 Baby in his arms
 Saint behind the glass
 Has a baby in his arms
 
 Wathces me sleep
 Watches me sleep
 Saint behind the glass
 Wathces me while I sleep
 
 Coffee in the air
 Coffee in the air
 Saint behind the glass
 Smells coffee in the air
 
 Curtains blowing 'round
 Curtains blowing 'round
 Saint behind the glass
 Sees the curtains blowing 'round
 
 Night upon my head
 Night upon my head
 Saint behind the glass
 Lays night upon my head
 
 Mother don't cry
 Mother don't cry
 Saint behind the glass
 Tells mother not to cry
 
 When love's in vain, love can be so strange
 There ain't nothing I can take to kill this pain
 Set me free
 Why don't you, Rosa Lee?
 
 She is a dream, but she's so hard to please
 She moves around like an Egyptian queen
 Set me free
 Why don't you, Rosa Lee?
 
 I'm so afraid of losing you
 But there's only so much that a man can do
 For Rosa Lee
 Why don't you set me free?
 
 When I hit the road the time goes slow
 Thinking about the places I used to go
 With Rosa Lee
 Why won't you set me free?
 
 They're trying to close the Tu y Yo
 The Latin playboy and the sky room shows
 Rosa Lee
 Why don't they let them be?
 
 I can't get used to losing you
 But there's only so much that a man can do
 For Rosa Lee
 Why don't you set me free?
 
 People say that you were made for me
 I knocked my head 
 But they'll never know the hurt it takes to be
 Rosa Lee
 
 When love's in vain, love can be so strange
 But I never thought I'd wear a ball and chain
 Set me free
 Why don't you, Rosa Lee?
 
 Set me free
 Why don't you, Rosa Lee?
 Why don't you set me free
 Why don't you Rosa Lee, yeah
 
 Why don't you set free, why don't you set free
 You got to set me free
 You got to, you got to, you got to set free, baby, ah, yeah, ooh
 
 The wind blows through the valley
 It's warm and hard and wild
 It gets all up inside the trees
 And shakes the leaves all night
 They shake up through the mountains
 They shake up to the sky
 They shake up to the moon above
 And then it starts to shine
 And Lord, it makes me tremble
 And Lord, it makes me tremble
 They shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes, yeah
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 
 A fault runs through the valley
 It's long as it is mean
 It starts to tear into the earth
 And gets all in between
 It shakes up through the mountains
 It shakes down to the sea
 It shakes up to the volcano
 And then it starts to scream
 And Lord, it makes me tremble
 And Lord, it makes me tremble
 It's shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes, yeah
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 
 There's a woman in this valley
 She's sweet as she is rough
 And when she starts to dance that way
 She shakes the boys all up
 She shakes it through the mountains
 She shakes it through the night
 She shakes it like a hurricane
 She gives a blind man sight
 And Lord, it makes me tremble
 And Lord, it makes me tremble
 She's shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes, yeah
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes, yeah
 Shakin' and shakin' and shakes
 
 Dreams wash down the gutter
 All my hopes in vain
 Crows up on the rooftop
 Laughing out my name
 
 Here I am on the short side of nothing
 Here I am on the short side of nothing
 
 We danced all night as life stood by
 We told another lie
 Found a spot down by the roadside
 There I closed my eyes
 
 And here I am on the short side of nothing
 Here I am on the short side of nothing
 All alone, all alone
 Can't find my way home
 
 Summer has come and the heat hangs low
 No escape in sight
 Sirens scream and lovers moan
 Just like any other night
 
 And here I am on the short side of nothing
 Here I am on the short side of nothing
 All alone, all alone
 Can't find my way home
 
 I said shotgun shoot 'em 'fore he run now do the jerk baby do the jerk now.
 .

 I said shotgun shoot 'em 'fore he run now do the jerk baby do the jerk now.

 I said Put on your high-heeled shoes.
 I said we're goin' down here and I listen to 'em play the blues.
 We're gonna dig potatoes, we're gonna pick tomatoes.
 I said shotgun shoot 'em 'fore he run now do the jerk baby do the jerk now.

 Si quisiera despreciar te despreciaba 
 Si quisiera aborrecer te aborrec'a 
 Si te fueras por tu ausencia no llor'ba 
 Y negara que un tiempo fuistes mia 
 
 Es muy cierto que llor' cuando era ni'o 
 Y tambi'n cuando sufrian mi pobres padres 
 Pero nunca llorare por un carino, eso lo hacen 
 solamente los cobardes 
 
 Se que tienes muchas ganas de dejarme 
 Pero tienes mucho miedo que te siga 
 Cunado quieras ve a formar tu mundo aparte 
 Hasta nunca vete y Dios que te bendiga 
 
 Yo jamas he renegado de mi suerte 
 Y te pierdo porque ya era mi destino 
 Si no tengo ya motivos pa quererte 
 Y hay pa siempre cada quien por su camino 
 
 Se que tienes muchas ganas que dejarme 
 Pero tienes mucho miedo que te siga 
 Cunado quieras ve a formar tu mundo aparte 
 Hasta nunca vete y Dios que te bendiga 
 
 Who will clothe the children 
 When there's no shoes on their feet 
 When their stomach's empty 
 When there's nothing left to eat 
 
 How sad it is to see him 
 With his eyes down on the street 
 And when the night wraps up the light 
 Who will give him a bed to sleep 
 
 Some say n' some do 
 
 When the boys stand on the corner 
 When there's nobody around at home 
 Their hands are down in their pockets 
 Who will show them the way to go 
 
 Some say n' some do 
 Some say n' some do 
 Some say n' some do 
 
 I will, if you do 
 If I can, you will too 
 But I can't, cuz you won't 
 N' you can't, so I don't 
 
 Who will give more then a look 
 As their lives go flying by 
 As the sun goes up and down 
 Who will be left to cry 
 
 Some say n' some do 
 Some say n' some do 
 Some say n' some do
 
 Someday I will go home
 Someday I will go home
 And I'll find peace in the house
 Of my heavenly father
 And I will fear, fear no more
 
 I, I know down in my heart
 I know it won't be long
 And I shall see the face
 Of my savior
 I will fear, I will fear
 I will fear, pain no more
 
 Someday, I will go home
 Someday, I will go home
 And I shall take the hand
 Of my savior
 I will fear, I will fear
 I will fear, pain no more
 I, I will fear, I will fear
 Pain no more
 
 Driving home
 Driving home
 I'm driving home
 
 Girl you know, you can't go on this way
 Night after night, day after every day
 Whisper to me, what's in your aching heart
 This love you need is not very far
 Baby dry the tears from your eyes
 And take my hand as we walk into the night
 
 A soul on fire and a touch that's cold
 Seems to me that's all you've ever known
 Desperately looking for something that's real
 Hard to find is the love that can heal
 Baby dry the tears from your eyes
 And take my hand as we walk into the night
 Tender are the dreams
 That we try so hard to hide, so deep inside
 
 I don't know why you go on this way
 Night after night, and about every day
 Tell to me, the secrets only a girl could know
 How much to feel and just how much to show
 Baby dry the tears from your eyes
 And take my hand as we walk into the night
 
 When it's up to you
 To figure out what's right and wrong
 It's someone else's parade
 And yours is an unhappy song
 
 When it hurts so bad
 And you feel that you can't go on
 Each day goes by too fast
 And the nights are so very long
 
 You'll find out true
 What mother said to you
 That tears of god will show you the way
 The way to turn
 
 When your only escape
 Is a cheap nickel wine
 And the peace you need in your heart
 Is so very hard to find
 
 It's a stubborn life we lead
 And there's never no rest
 Trouble's out there looking for you
 Even when you try your best
 
 You'll find out true
 What mother said to you
 That tears of god will show you the way
 The way to turn
 
 Hide not your head
 The way to turn
 Hear what he once said
 He'll show you the way
 For there is a world for you and me
 Where the blind too can see
 Through the tears of god
 
 The son of the maker said
 This is my cross to bear
 Taking off of our shoulders
 Something we should have shared
 
 You'll find out true
 What mother said to you
 That tears of god will show you the way
 The way to turn
 
 Looking out my window
 I see my world has changed
 The sun won't rise this mornin'
 'Cause baby's gone away
 
 Yesterday I can tell myself
 That she'd be back for sure
 But that train don't stop here anymore
 Anymore
 
 She used to go out with the girls
 Every now and then
 She always came home early
 We'd jump in bed by ten
 She'd tell me that she loved me
 She would forevermore
 But that train don't stop here anymore
 Anymore, anymore, anymore
 
 Nothin' changes faster
 Than baby's fickle mind
 I know she' lovin' someone
 Somewhere down the line
 I know that she still has a key
 I'm waiting by the door
 But that train don't stop here anymore
 Anymore, anymore, anymore, alright
 Knock yourself out baby, woo
 
 She ran out through the back door
 Screamin' in the night
 She said I was the devil
 I didn't treat her right
 The man down at the station
 Said "That was her for sure"
 Now that train don't stop here anymore
 Anymore, anymore, anymore, awh shuckse
 
 We all looked so happy 
 When we climbed up on the bus 
 Berto waved a hand from his seat and said 
 "Good to have you, come ride with us" 
 
 "I got sweet water and a loaf of bread 
 Should last us about half a day 
 But you can't have more then a sip of wine 
 Cause we have to stay up most of the way" 
 
 Laying on a beat old sofa 
 On the porch when nights were hot 
 Eating instant mashed potatoes 
 From a big old iron pot 
 
 Never had much to worry about 
 Slept the night under a bunch of stars 
 Now all the doors got fifteen locks 
 And the windows are covered up with bars 
 
 Let's go down to the big ranch 
 The big ranch, the big ranch 
 Let's go down to the big ranch 
 The big ranch, the big ranch 
 Let's go down to the big ranch 
 The big ranch, the big ranch 
 Let's go down to the big ranch 
 The big ranch, the big ranch 
 
 Read in the paper just the other day 
 That the city's now full of guns 
 Whatever happened to the simple days 
 When the children could just play and run 
 
 I couldn't believe on that New Years Day 
 Julia turned around to John and said 
 "This year we're gonna get us a Colt 45" 
 "Keep it near us under the bed" 
 
 How could things be so easy some days 
 And so hard in times when I could use 
 Some help coming by my way 
 I just don't know why you won't take me for myself 
 
 You say that I should be somebody 
 Don't you think that I'd be funny 
 In a suit and tie, ol' mister nine-to-five 
 I just don't know why you won't take me for myself 
 
 I've been racking my brain 
 Trying to find a way to make ends meet 
 I've been making two bridges 
 Write you songs that you can sing 
 There ain't anybody else that I could be 
 
 Say, how long will it be now 
 How long will it be now 
 How long will it be now 
 How long will it take to make him see my side 
 I ain't no nine to five 
 I just don't know why you won't take me for myself 
 
 If you could only own a mountain made of solid gold 
 What difference would it make 
 You'd just have more to break 
 And I don't know why you won't take me for myself 
 I just don't know why you won't take me for myself 
 I just don't know why you won't take me for myself 
 I just don't know why you won't take me for myself
 
 A warm wind is blowing through the valleys and the mountain tops
 Down the road to a place we know so well
 The children are running with ribbons in their baby hands
 While we all gather 'round the Giving Tree
 
 Let's go sing songs, the blue ones
 Let's go sing about the Lord above
 And thank the old sun for all we have
 The sad times, the glad times
 The babies swinging in our arms
 Just don't seem like much like rain 'round the Giving Tree
 
 Like the shepherds once followed a star bright up in the sky
 We've come to say, come be with us know
 Come give us a good one
 Come give us a happy time
 While we all here dance 'round the Giving Tree
 
 On the barren slopes of a thousand hopes
 Where a warm wind blows
 To a place where I could rest my bones
 
 All my life I've worked the earth
 For what it's worth
 Sun and dirt is all I've ever known
 
 Gone this way so many times
 To make the climb
 In the way I always do and will
 
 But this day I heard a sound
 As I looked around
 And there she was standing on the hill
 
 Blue, the color of her flowing dress
 She touched my head with a hand to bless
 I stood as if my legs had turned to stone
 Brown, the color of her skin like mine
 Said in a voice all too divine
 "From this day, son, you'll never be alone"
 
 The sweetest music filled the air
 Gone were all my cares
 Felt like I was walking in a dream
 
 Said pick the roses from around her feet
 Like I had never seen
 "Take them down to all who don't believe"
 
 Blue, the color of her flowing dress
 She touched my head with a hand to bless
 I stood as if I my legs had turned to stone
 Brown, the color of her skin like mine
 Said in a voice all too divine
 "From this day, son, you'll never be alone"
 
 In ancient times
 To a place so far away
 Across the land
 Where the earth was
 As tough as clay
 
 Looked at their hands
 Looked all around
 And they seemed pleased
 At what they had found
 
 Here in the valley
 Bread on the table
 Work through the day
 For as long as we are able
 Green is the valley
 Blue is the night
 Out of the shadows
 Into the light
 
 They could have gone
 But instead they chose to stay
 To watch the clouds way up high
 As they turned to gray
 And through the dark
 Broke a crimson sun
 And at that moment
 Knew their lives had just begun
 
 Here in the valley
 Bread on the table
 Work through the day
 For as long as we are able
 Green is the valley
 Blue is the night
 Out of the darkness
 Into the light
 
 Here in the valley
 Bread on the table
 Work through the day
 For as long as we are able
 Green is the valley
 Blue is the night
 Out of the darkness
 Into the light
 
 The word's out on the street 
 Around everyone you meet 
 "Things are not the way they used to be" 
 
 There's a feeling in the air 
 A dark cloud of despair 
 That hides our hearts 
 And blinds our eyes to see 
 
 They say that it's a shame 
 That all we do is blame 
 And never treat ourselves with dignity 
 
 What would we do 
 Without a hand to hold onto 
 With no one to call out to 
 What if we could 
 Behave like sisters and brothers 
 Like the good book says we should 
 
 It's time, time, time 
 We try so hard to find 
 But time has no mercy on me 
 Just take a look at love 
 On the wings of a dove 
 Gives us everything we want for free 
 
 What will you say or do 
 When a child asks of you 
 What kind of world have you left here for me? 
 
 Too many sleepless nights 
 Too many questions why 
 This is not the way it's supposed to be 
 
 What happened to 
 The land, the trees and the rivers 
 Some have now all gone away 
 What happens if 
 We see them as sisters and brothers 
 Like the good Lord says we should 
 
 There's a word on the street 
 From everyone you meet 
 Peace is the only way for us to be 
 
 There's a feeling in the air 
 Do away with this despair 
 Let's hear our hearts 
 And open our eyes to see 
 
 What would we do 
 Without a hand to hold onto 
 With no one to call out to 
 What if we could 
 Behave like sisters and brothers 
 Like the good book says we should 
 
 And so we've come a long way 
 Too, too long baby, I've got to say 
 And even though we had some fun 
 I'm tellin' you honey, I've got to run 
 
 Well it seems you had your time 
 Takin' everything from me you could find 
 But now the table's turned 
 And this old heart you'll never burn 
 But this bird's got to fly, bird's got to fly 
 I'm tellin' you honey, this bird's got to fly, so long 
 Got to be on my way 
 
 You always seemed so clever 
 With your little books that you read forever 
 Always a-keepin' me down, but now I'm gonna come back around 
 A-tears a-burnin' me, a-pain a-burnin' me, can't you see? 
 
 And I'm tired of wasting precious time 
 To you my life ain't worth a single dime 
 But this bird's got to fly, bird's got to fly 
 I'm tellin' you honey, this bird's got to fly, so long 
 Got to be on my way 
 
 And so we've come a long way 
 Too, too long baby, I've got to say 
 I'm tired of wastin' precious time 
 Cause to you my life ain't worth a single dime 
 So this bird's got to fly, bird's got to fly 
 I'm tellin' you honey, this bird's got to fly, so long 
 Got to be on my way 
 So so long 
 Got to be on my way 
 Ya, so long baby
 
 Why do the days
 Go by so fast
 If only time
 Was built to last
 
 If it could learn
 To take it slow
 Then maybe time
 At last would know
 
 That if Monday, Tuesday
 Should go away
 It'll be Wednesday, Thursday
 Then Saturday
 And when Sunday comes
 It's just too late
 It's gotta be this time
 
 How come the days
 Do what they do
 Maybe if time
 Time only knew
 
 Could be that time
 Don't really know
 That it should try
 To take it slow
 
 Then maybe Monday, Tuesday
 Won't go away
 Then maybe Thursday, Friday
 Could be like Saturday
 And when Sunday comes
 It's never too late
 It'll be this time
 It's gotta be this time
 
 How come the days
 Do what they do
 Maybe if time
 Time only knew
 
 That if Monday, Tuesday
 Should go away
 It'll be Wednesday, Thursday
 Then Saturday
 And when Sunday comes
 It's just too late
 It's gotta be this time
 It's gotta be this time
 It's never too late
 It'll be this time
 
 It don't look
 Don't look like I'm going nowhere
 Five cents for a bottle
 A quarter rolling down the stairs
 All in all I ain't got
 Ain't got much in a tin can trust
 
 Don't know how
 But it's gotta be going somewhere
 A dime store shirt
 And two bucks for a good pair
 All in all it ain't much ain't got much in my tin can trust
 
 Little darling
 I can't buy you 
 Those gold rings and things
 But honey
 I can give you
 One thing a man can bring
 
 All in all I ain't got
 Don't got much
 All in all there ain't much
 Just some love in a tin can trust
 
 Oh darling
 Can't buy you
 All those pretty things
 Big money can't give you
 Fancy cars and diamond rings
 Oh honey
 Got nothin'
 It's only love I bring
 
 One hundred and fifty miles from Mexico to LA 
 Doesn't seem that far but still a world away 
 Went up to see her husband Tony 
 Who left some years ago 
 He wrote to say come be with me 
 I love and miss you so 
 
 And I promise that I'll care for you 
 Wrote Tony to his wife 
 Now and for the rest of my life 
 
 Tony washes dishes, Maria she sweeps floors 
 The dreams that they once had 
 Well they don't have them anymore 
 Instead she stares up at the ceiling 
 While most are fast asleep 
 She thinks about her babies 
 And prays the lord their souls to keep 
 
 We promised that we'd care for them 
 Said Tony to his wife 
 Now and for the rest of our lives 
 
 One time late at night while looking at the sky 
 They saw a shooting star burning silver and so bright 
 Said could this here be a sign 
 That it's time to go back home 
 Cause even with you near me 
 I still feel all alone 
 
 We promised that we'd care for one another 
 Said his wife 
 Now and for the rest of our lives
 
 Not 'bout winning or losing 
 Or being confident 
 
 Not for smiling even crying 
 Or 'bout sentiment 
 
 Not 'bout richer or poorer 
 Or being affluent 
 
 Not 'bout sharp or even clever 
 Or intelligent 
 Intelligent 
 
 Don't really matter at all 
 When a house of cards gonna fall 
 Before you try again 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 
 Never 'bout being wrong 
 Or ever right 
 
 Never a winner or loser 
 Or acting outta sight 
 Outta sight 
 
 Don't really matter at all 
 When a house of cards gonna fall 
 Before you try again 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 
 Whether coming or going 
 Never know what to do 
 
 Never look for a reason 
 When you break the rules 
 
 Before you try again 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 Turn around 
 Before you try again 
 Turn around
 
 Two Janes running along the tracks
 Saying "We don't want to live this way
 Ain't never coming back"
 
 Jane number one looked as happy as can be
 Jane number two knew what could set them free
 Too many nights hiding under beds
 Too many fears to fill their pretty heads
 Everybody knows they must have been insane
 So goes the tale of two Janes
 
 Tears falling down behind the bedroom door
 "No matter how I try, I just don't know what for
 Too many times, I'm banging into walls
 Too many times, I cry but no one ever calls"
 Everybody knows they must have been insane
 So goes the tale of two Janes
 
 Jane number one is standing at the gate
 Jane number two has the key that holds their fate
 Too many angels with brand new silken wings
 Too many cries for love but no one hears a thing
 Everybody knows they must have been insane
 So goes the tale of two Janes
 Everybody knows they must have been insane
 So goes the tale of two Janes
 
 The last time I seen Viking 
 He was about this tall 
 With a tattoo 
 Where a smile should've been 
 Of his sweetheart's name 
 Of his sweetheart's name 
 
 Do you remember Viking? 
 He was about you and me 
 With a big scar 
 Where his heart should've been 
 Inside his chest 
 Inside his chest 
 
 Do you remember Viking? 
 Do you remember Viking? 
 
 The last time I saw Viking 
 He was about so tall 
 With a tattoo 
 Where his heart should've been 
 He was about everything 
 He was about everything 
 Do you remember Viking? 
 Do you remember Viking? 
 I remember Viking
 
 Este amor apasionado
 Anda todo alborotado por volver
 Voy camino a la locura
 Y aunque todo me tortura, se querer
 
 Nos dejamos hace tiempo
 Pero se llego el momento de perder
 Tu tenias mucha razon
 Le hago caso al corazon
 Y me muero por volver
 
 Y volver, volver, volver
 A tus brazos otra vez
 Llegare hasta donde estes
 Yo se perder, yo se perder
 Quiero volver, volver, volver
 
 Nos dejamos hace tiempo
 Pero se llego el momento de perder
 Tu tenias mucha razon
 Le hago caso al corazon
 Y me muero por volver
 
 Y volver, volver, volver
 A tus brazos otra vez
 Llegare hasta donde estes
 Yo se perder, yo se perder
 Quiero volver, volver, volver
 
 My legs are tired
 My face feels hot
 Wake up Dolores
 Please try to walk
 
 Oh sacred night
 
 Our light is dim
 We have so far to go
 The stones are hard
 On this endless road
 
 Oh sacred night
 On quetzal plumes
 Of dying suns
 And purple moons
 Oh sacred night
 
 As an eagle soars
 Our spirits fly
 To our gentle rest
 Under loving sky
 
 Oh sacred night
 On quetzal plumes
 Of dying suns
 And purple moons
 Oh sacred night

 You're mine and we belong together
 Yes, we belong together, for eternity
 
 You're mine, your lips belong to me
 Yes, they belong to only me, for eternity
 
 You're mine, my baby and you'll always be
 I swear by everything I own
 You'll always, always be mine
 
 You're mine and, we belong together
 Yes, we belong together, for eternity
 
 I'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do
 I'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do
 I don't want to buy it
 I just want to rent it for an hour or two
 
 I met an old mistake walking down the street today
 I met an old mistake walking down the street today
 I didn't want to be mean about it
 I couldn't think of one good word to say
 
 West LA fadeaway, west LA fadeaway
 Little red light on the highway, big green light on the speedway hey, hey, hey
 
 I had a steady job hauling items for the mob
 I had a steady job hauling items for the mob
 Know the pay was pathetic
 It's a shame those boys couldn't be more copacetic
 
 I need a west LA girl, already know what I need to know
 I need a west LA girl, already know what I need to know
 Lord, just how far to go
 
 West LA fadeaway, west LA fadeaway
 Little red light on the highway, big green light on the speedway hey, hey, hey

 When we don't seem to see eye to eye 
 Our arms reach out to ask but why 
 You're not alone 
 Call me on the phone 
 And tell me, oh tell me 
 Oh what in the world 
 What in the world will we do 
 
 When a house of cards comes tumbling down 
 And the pieces lie there on the ground 
 Don't be afraid 
 It can't be too late 
 Tell me, oh tell me 
 Oh what in the world 
 What in the world will we do 
 
 When a bird flies high up in the sky 
 Funny how we sit and wonder why 
 Suppose that we 
 Could be that free 
 Tell me, oh tell me 
 Oh what in the world 
 What in the world will we do 
 
 Tell me, oh tell me 
 Oh what in the world 
 What in the world will we do 
 
 When a bird flies high up in the sky 
 Funny how we sit and wonder why 
 Suppose that we 
 Could be that free 
 Suppose you and me 
 Were always that free 
 Imagine, imagine 
 Oh what this world 
 What this world could be 
 
 Imagine, baby, imagine 
 What this world could be 
 What this world could be 
 Baby, what this world 
 What this world could be
 
 Mother, mother
 There's too many of you crying
 Brother, brother, brother
 There's far too many of you dying
 You know we've got to find a way
 To bring some lovin' here today, yea
 
 Father, father
 We don't need to escalate
 You see, war is not the answer
 For only love can conquer hate
 You know we've got to find a way
 To bring some lovin' here today
 
 Picket lines and picket signs
 Don't punish me with brutality
 Talk to me, so you can see
 Oh, what's going on
 What's going on
 Ya, what's going on
 Ah, what's going on
 
 In the mean time
 Right on, baby
 Right on
 Right on
 
 Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
 Oh, but who are they to judge us
 Simply because our hair is long
 Oh, you know we've got to find a way
 To bring some understanding here today
 Oh
 
 Picket lines and picket signs
 Don't punish me with brutality
 Talk to me
 So you can see
 What's going on
 Ya, what's going on
 Tell me what's going on
 I'll tell you what's going on - Uh
 Right on baby
 Right on baby
 
 Could have had a chance to get out of this wreck
 The time that you came and the day that you left
 Could have had a chance
 Could have had a chance
 
 Never thought I could make it this far
 With a dent in my soul and a hole in my heart
 Never thought I could
 Never thought I could
 
 But when the lights are turning 'round
 And wheels are rolling on the ground
 That day I'll burn this whole place down
 When the circus comes to town
 
 You left your name carved on a tree
 You scratched mine out right in front of me
 Didn't mean that much
 Didn't mean that much
 
 But when the lights are turning 'round
 And wheels are rolling on the ground
 The day I'll burn this whole place down
 When the circus comes to town
 
 Scratch your name out on that tree
 I'll chase your heart right out of me
 Doesn't mean that much
 Doesn't mean that much
 
 'Cause when the lights are turning 'round
 And wheels are rolling on the ground
 The day I'll burn this whole place down
 When the circus comes to town
 When the circus comes
 
 Heaven is a place where good men go
 Maybe it's a place that I won't know
 Heading down that whiskey trail
 
 Mama told me not to run, 'cause I might fall
 But never was the kind to listen much at all
 Heading down that whiskey trail
 
 Damn that old whiskey trail
 
 Daddy drank his dinner from a paper sack
 Made it out the door one day
 And never came back
 Heading down that whiskey trail
 
 They say that I'm a chip off a son of a gun
 With nowhere to hide out and nowhere to run
 Heading down that whiskey trail
 
 Can't you hear the engines wail
 Damn that old whiskey trail
 
 Can't you hear the engines wail
 Damn that old whiskey trail
 
 That's why we wish, baby 
 Cause forever is way too long 
 That's why we wish, baby baby 
 Cause it's here today 
 And then it's gone 
 
 It's when a boy 
 Grows up into a man 
 And a seed turns into a tree 
 It's when two lovers kiss 
 Forever it seems 
 And the blind man at last can see 
 
 That's why we wish, baby 
 Cause forever is way too long 
 That's why we wish, baby 
 Cause it's here today 
 And then it's gone 
 
 How 'bout the girl 
 Who finds a dream come true 
 In a man that loves her so 
 And the orphan cries 
 Forever it seems 
 Until at last he finds a home 
 
 That's why we wish, baby 
 Cause forever is way too long 
 That's why we wish, baby baby 
 Cause it's here today 
 And then it's gone 
 
 Once a poor poor soul 
 Found what looked like a stone 
 And held up into the sun 
 Saw a diamond shining 
 Forever it seemed 
 And his searching, searching days were gone 
 
 That's why we wish, baby 
 Cause forever is way too long 
 That's why we wish, baby baby 
 Cause it's here today 
 And then it's gone 
 That's why we wish, baby 
 That's why we wish, baby baby
 
 Rain, rain, rain, a wicked rain
 Falling from the sky
 Down, down, down, pouring down
 Upon the night
 Well there's just one chance in a million
 That someday we'll make it out alive
 
 Rain, rain, rain, an evil rain
 Falling all the time
 Sun, sun, sun
 Sun don't ever want to shine
 Well there'll be no light in the morning
 Till some peace at last we find
 
 Like travelers in the darkness
 Can't see our way
 Trying hard to make it through
 Another day
 
 Father, father, father
 Why do you let your sons go astray
 Brother, brother, brother
 Why must we go on this way
 There's a storm off in the distance
 And it looks like it's here to stay
 
 Rain, rain, rain
 Rain, rain, rain
 
 Through the chill of winter
 Running across a frozen lake
 Hunters hard on his trail
 All odds are against him
 With a family to provide for
 But one thing he must keep alive
 Will the wolf survive?
 
 Drifting by the roadside
 Climbs a strong and aging face
 Wants to make some honest pay
 Losing to the rainstorm
 He's got two strong legs to guide him
 Two strong arms keep him alive
 Will the wolf survive?
 
 Standing in the pouring rain
 All alone in a world that's changed
 Running scared now forced to hide
 In a land where he once stood with pride
 But he'll find his way by the morning light
 
 Sounds across the nation
 Coming from your hearts and minds
 Battered drums and old guitars
 Singing songs of passion
 It's the truth that they all look for
 Something they must keep alive
 Will the wolf survive?
 Will the wolf survive?
 
 Le canto a mi patria, le canto a mi gente
 Le canto a mi madre, le canto a mi padre
 Y hasta el presidente
 
 Este ritmo suave, que me hace bailar
 A toas las chicas, ay que bonitas
 Las pongo a gozar
 
 Que bonito baila, baila cumbia mi morena
 Mueve la cintura, ella me hace que yo me muera
 Tambien a mis barrios, y a todos los vatos
 Les tocamos rolas, este baile padre
 Como el vailenato
 
 Muevete mi linda, mueve la cadera
 Mira que tan lindo te vez bailando
 Como una sirena
 
 Que bonito baila, baila cumbia mi morena
 Mueve la cintura, ella me hace que yo me muera
 
 Tambien a mis barrios, y a todos los vatos
 Les tocamos rolas, este baile padre
 Como el vallenato
 
 Muevete mi linda, mueve la cadera
 Mira que tan lindo te vez bailando
 Como una sirena
 
 Que bonito baila, baila cumbia mi morena
 Mueve la cintura, ella me hace que yo me muera
