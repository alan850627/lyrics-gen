 A long time ago
 A precious child was born, 
 here to give the greatest gift we could ever know
 And each year in December we celebrate and sing
 a child's gift of love
 and the joy that it can bring
 
 Allelujah
 Feliz Navidad
 Joyeux Noel
 Merry Christmas
 A child's gift of love
 Feliz Navidad
 Joyeux Noel
 Merry Christmas
 
 The greatest gift of all
 So the children know
 Is born within our hearts and 
 That's where it can grow 
 A gift for our loved ones, 
 A gift for our friends
 A gift for all creation, 
 a gift that never ends
 
 Allelujah
 Feliz Navidad
 Joyeux Noel
 Merry Christmas
 A child's gift of love
 Feliz Navidad
 Joyeux Noel
 Merry Christmas
 Merry Christmas
 
 Rainbows of light mark the season
 Calling us to peace in our time
 a way of life that honours all the children 
 a gift of love that circles the sun
 
 All around are those who are hurting and hungry
 And those without a home or family
 We pray for the children, alone or afraid
 Near where we live
 Or half a world away
 
 Allelujah
 Feliz Navidad
 Joyeux Noel
 Merry Christmas
 A child's gift of love
 Feliz Navidad
 Joyeux Noel
 Merry Christmas
 A child's gift of love
 Feliz Navidad
 Joyeux Noel
 Merry Christmas
 Merry Christmas
 Merry Christmas

 Spoken:
 Merry Christmas, Feliz Navidad, Joyeux Noel, Merry Christmas

 Baby beluga in the deep blue sea
 Swim so wild and you swim so free
 Heaven above and the sea below
 And a little white whale on the go
 
 Baby beluga, baby beluga
 Is the water warm
 Is your mama home with you, so happy
 
 Way down yonder where the dolphins play
 Where you dive and splash all day
 Waves roll in and the waves roll out
 See the water squirtin' out of your spout
 
 Baby beluga, oh, baby beluga
 Sing your little song
 Sing for all your friends, we like to hear you
 
 When it's dark, you're home and fed
 Curl up, snug in your water bed
 Moon is shining and the stars are out
 Good night, little whale, good night

 You'll soon be wakin'

 The eensy weensy spider
 Went up the water spout
 Down came the rain and
 Washed the spider out
 Out came the sun and
 Dried up all the rain
 And the eensy weensy spider
 Went up the spout again
 Then the little spider
 Began to weave her thread
 Of gossamer and silk
 She spun herself a bed
 Round and round she went
 Till all her work was done
 And soon a magic web lay
 Gleaming in the sun

 It's feeling like a wasted night
 The piano's dead, the drummer's tight
 The song's gone cold but no one seems to mind
 Evangeline I'll try again some time
 
 I've heard it from a friend or two
 They say they like the things I do
 But friends are seldom more than company
 Evangeline, you're what a friend should be
 
 Freedom friend you've found me
 Now love is all around me
 Imagine my surprise, imagine my surprise
 
 The city streets are no place to hide
 And failure loves me like a bride
 But points her finger now to someone new
 So, Evangeline, I'm coming home to you
 
 Freedom friend you've found me
 Now love is all around me
 Imagine my surprise, imagine my surprise
 
 It's feeling like a wasted night
 The piano's dead, the drummer's tight
 The song's gone cold, but no one seems to mind
 Evangeline I'll try again some time

 Every child, every child, is a child of the universe
 Here to sing, here to sing, a song of beauty and grace
 Here to love, here to love, like a flower out in bloom
 Every girl and boy a blessing and a joy
 
 Every child, every child, of man and woman-born
 Fed with love, fed with love, in the milk that's mother's own
 A healthy child, healthy child, as the dance of life unfolds
 Every child in the family, safe and warm
 
 Dreams of children free to fly
 Free of hunger, and war
 Clean flowing water and air to share
 With dolphins and elephants and whales all around
 
 Every child, every child, dreams of peace in this world
 Wants a home, wants a home, and a gentle hand to hold
 To provide, to provide, room to grow and to belong
 In the loving village of human kindness
 
 Every little wish and every little dream
 Has a chance of coming true at Christmas
 Every little song sung throughout the year
 Has a chance of being heard at Christmas
 
 Every little prayer and every little hope
 Is the joy of Christmas time
 All our loving hearts, beating all as one
 Everybody felt there's enough to go around
 All our loving hearts, beating all as one
 The joy of Christmas time
 
 Every little wish and every little dream
 Has a chance of coming true at Christmas
 Every little song sung throughout the year
 Has a chance of being heard at Christmas
 
 Every little prayer and every little hope
 Is the joy of Christmas time
 All our loving hearts, beating all as one
 Everybody felt there's enough to go around
 All our loving hearts, beating all as one
 The joy of Christmas time
 
 Everything grows and grows
 Babies do

 A blade of grass, fingers and toes
 Hair on my head, a red, red rose
 Everything grows, anyone knows
 That's how it goes
 
 Yes, everything grows and grows

 Fais dodo, Colin, mon' p'tit fr're
 Fais dodo, t'auras du lolo
 Maman est en haut, qui fait du gateau
 Papa est en bas, gui fait du chocolate
 Go to sleep, Colin, my little brother
 Go to sleep, tomorrow you'll have milk
 Mama is upstairs making a cake
 Papa is downstairs making chocolate
 
 Well, the bar seems so crazy tonight
 So noisy, and the smoke is making me lazy
 But don't it feel so grand
 To know that I'm the man
 Driving everybody to drink?
 
 My heart goes ping
 To hear that cash register sing
 Ringing out the boss' favorite sounds
 And it makes me think that I'm in the wrong business
 Making music used to be so much fun
 
 And I wish this stage I'm on would soon leave town
 I guess I just got a case of them old familiar
 What a drag it is to fake it
 How much longer can I take it blues
 
 How can I ever forget entertaining
 Identical carbon copies of the latest hip styles?
 Do you think I could ever regret contemplatin'
 Sneakin' in through the back door of this crazy scene?
 
 I guess I better get my mind back onto singing
 The jukebox in me gets so easily distracted
 And it makes me think that I'm in the wrong business
 Making music used to be so much fun
 
 And I wish this stage I'm on would soon leave town
 I guess I just a got a case of them old familiar
 What a drag it is to fake it
 How much longer can I take it blues
 
 Mr. Blue Suede Shoes just walked in the door
 Feeling low down and just trying to shake it
 Catches a glimpse of Miss 1942
 Freshly arrived from the wax museum
 
 He's done this all before but he'll do it once more
 Testing out his latest batch of brand-new lies
 And she surely wants it but she mustn't ever show it
 And he can't say he needs her or he'll blow it again
 
 And I wonder what is bugging Mr. Shoes right now-
 Could it he's got a case of them old familiar
 What a drag it is to fake it
 How much longer can I take it blues?
 
 And I wish this stage I'm on would soon leave town
 I know I got a dose of them old familiar
 What a drag it is to fake it
 How much longer can I take it blues
 
 I'd like to sing a song of friends
 My special life's companions
 Smiles that I can count on
 In my weariest of times
 
 When I'm riding low,
 And peace is just a memory
 I only have to think of you
 And I begin to glow
 
 And I feel like a million
 Feel like a million
 Feel like a million
 To have the friends I do
 
 Oh, I feel like a million
 Feel like a million
 Feel like a million
 To know the likes of you
 
 My shoe have a hole in it
 My pants they might need mending
 A downpour may have found its way
 To trickling round my toes
 
 The rent may seem impossible
 Every Monday on the nose
 At times like these, I know your love is with me
 And it shows
 
 And I feel like a million
 Feel like a million
 Feel like a million
 To have the friends I do
 
 Oh, I feel like a million
 Feel like a million
 Feel like a million
 To know the likes of you
 
 Oh, I feel like a million
 To have the friends I do
 
 On a hot, hot day in July...
 
 Five green and speckled frogs

 Eating some most delicious bugs.

 Over the hills and far away. 
 Mother duck said, "Quack, quack, quack, quack!"
 But only four little ducks came back.

 Five little pumpkins sitting on a gate
 First one said "Oh my, it's getting late!"
 Second one said "There are witches in the air"
 The third one said " but we don't care!"
 The fourth one said "let's run and run and run"
 The fifth one said "I'm ready for some fun!"
 Ooo ooo went the wind, and out went the light
 And the five little pumpkins rolled out of sight
 
 Where the earth shows its bones of wind-broken stone
 The sea and the sky are one
 I'm caught out of time, my blood sings with wine
 Running naked in the sun
 There's God in the trees, I'm weak in the knees
 The sky is a painful blue
 I'd like to look around, but Honey, all I see is you.
 
 The summer city lights will soften the night
 Till you'd think that the air is clear
 I'm sitting with friends, where forty-five cents
 Will buy another glass of beer
 He's got something to say, but I'm so far away
 I don't know who I'm talking to
 Cause you just walked in the door, and Honey, all I see is you
 
 And I just want to hold you closer than I've ever held anyone before
 You say you've been twice a wife and you're through with life
 Ah, but Honey, what the hell's it for?
 After twenty-three years you'd think I could find
 A way to let you know somehow
 That I want to see your smiling face forty-five years from now.
 
 Alone in the lights on stage every night
 I've been reaching out to find a friend
 Someone who knows the words, sings so she's heard
 Knows how all the stories end
 Maybe after the show she'll ask me to go
 Home with her for a drink or two
 Her smile lights her eyes, but Honey, all I see is you
 
 And I just want to hold you closer than I've ever held anyone before
 You say you've been twice a wife and you're through with life
 Ah, but Honey, what the hell's it for?
 After twenty-three years you'd think I could find
 A way to let you know somehow
 That I want to see your smiling face forty-five years from now.
 
 Yes, I just want to hold you closer than I've ever held anyone before
 You say you've been twice a wife and you're through with life
 Ah, but Honey, what the hell's it for?
 After twenty-three years you'd think I could find
 A way to let you know somehow
 That I want to see your smiling face forty-five years from now.
 Yes, I want to see your smiling face forty-five years from now.

 Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
 With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
 And two eyes made out of coal
 
 'Frosty the snowman' is a fairy tale they say
 He was made of snow
 But the children know how he came to life one day
 
 There must have been some magic in
 That ol' silk hat they found
 For when they placed it on his head
 He began to dance around, oh
 
 Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
 And the children say, he could laugh and play
 Just the same as you and me
 
 Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
 So he said, Let's run and we'll have some fun
 Now before I melt away
 
 Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
 Runnin' here and there all around the square
 Sayin', Catch me if you can
 
 He led them down the streets of town
 Right to the traffic cop
 And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop or
 
 Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
 But he waved goodbye sayin', Don't you cry
 I'll be back again some day
 
 Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
 Look at Frosty go
 Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
 Over the hills of snow

 I've been a good luck boy
 Most all of my life
 Never known much trouble
 I guess I've nowhere to hide
 Fortune did some fancy picking
 To pick my ma and pa
 They brought me up with home-cooked loving
 And bought my first guitar
 
 I've been a good luck boy
 Most all of my life
 I found me a loving woman
 You know, she's just like a wife
 Keeps me up when the sun goes down
 I ain't one to complain
 My friends all tell me since we met
 I just ain't been the same I've been
 
 I'm feeling mighty high
 I hope I start a trend
 Feel like everything I've ever wanted
 Was waitin' round the bend
 Thanks for the cards and letters, Lord
 I hope we keep in touch
 And if you think you'd like to visit,
 I'd like that very much
 
 Raffi: I could, uh, cook you some rice and veggies, perhaps. Armenian style.

 Nations of children on and on reaching out for love
 Falling down, turning round, reaching out for love
 
 Nations of children near and far sailing round the sun
 Tears of laughter ringing on, reaching out for love
 
 First world, 2nd world, 3rd world, 4th world
 One world for the human child
 All rise up, all join hands for the human child
 
 Their world, your world, my world, our world
 One world for the human child
 All rise up, all join hands for the human child
 
 Human tears fall the same, every culture you can name
 Fear and sadness mark the pain of the human child
 
 Human smiles form the same, of joy of laughter, right as rain
 Human sunshine, love of life - the human child
 
 We are as one world, we can be one world
 We can be one world, we can be
 
 We are as one tribe, we can be one tribe
 We can be one tribe, we can be

 I wonder if I'm growing
 I wonder if I'm growing
 My mom says yes I'm growing
 But it's hard for me to see
 My mom says eat your sandwich
 It will make you grow up tall
 But when I eat my sandwich
 I'm hardly bigger at all
 
 And I wonder if I'm growing
 I wonder if I'm growing
 My mom says yes Im growing
 But it's hard for me to see
 
 My mom says wash your hands now
 Then you can go and play
 Hey! I can reach the tap now
 For the very first time today
 And I think I must be growing
 Oh I know I'm really growing
 My mom says yes I'm growing
 And now I know it's true
 
 There's no stronger wind than the one that blows
 Down a lonesome railroad line
 No prettier sight than looking back
 On a town you left behind
 There is nothin' that's as real
 As a love that's in my mind
 
 Close your eyes
 I'll be here in the morning
 Close your eyes
 I'll be here for a while
 
 There's lots of things along the road
 I'd surely like to see
 I'd like to lean into the wind
 And tell myself I'm free
 But your softest whisper's louder
 Than the highways call to me
 
 Close your eyes
 I'll be here in the morning
 Close your eyes
 I'll be here for a while
 
 All the mountains and the rivers
 And the valleys can't compare
 To your blue lit dancin' eyes
 And yellow shining hair
 I could never hit the open road
 And leave you layin' there
 
 Close your eyes
 I'll be here in the morning
 Close your eyes
 I'll be here for a while
 
 Lay your head back easy, love 
 Close your cryin' eyes
 I'll be layin' here beside you
 When the sun comes on the rise
 I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails
 And the lonesome bluejay cries
 
 Close your eyes
 I'll be here in the morning
 Close your eyes
 I'll be here for a while
 Close your eyes
 I'll be here in the morning
 Close your eyes
 I'll be here for a while

 I've been working on the railroad
 All the live long day
 I've been working on the railroad
 Just to pass the time away
 Can't you hear the whistle blowing
 Rise up so early in the morn
 Can't you hear the captain shouting
 Dinah, blow your horn
 
 Dinah, won't you blow
 Dinah, won't you blow
 Dinah, won't you blow your horn
 Dinah, won't you blow

 Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
 Someone's in the kitchen I know
 Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
 Strumming on the old banjo
 
 And singing, fee-fi-fiddle-ee-i-oh
 Fee-fi-fiddle-ee-i-oh
 Fee-fi-fiddle-ee-i-oh
 Strumming on the old banjo!
 Strumming on the old banjo!

 If I had a dinosaur, just think what we could do
 He could lift me off the floor and take me to the zoo
 
 And if I had a dinosaur, just think what we could see
 We could look inside the clouds above my balcony
 
 And if I had a dinosaur, just think where we could
 Go. all the way to grandma's house to play her piano

 Dashing through the snow
 In a one-horse open sleigh
 Over the fields we go
 Laughing all the way
 Bells on bob-tail ring
 Making spirits bright
 What fun it is to ride
 And sing
 A sleighing song tonight
 
 Jingle bells, jingle bells
 Jingle all the way
 What fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh
 
 Now the ground is white
 Go it while you're young
 Take the girls tonight
 And sing this sleighing song
 Just get a bob-tailed bay
 Two-forty as his speed
 Hitch him to an open sleigh
 And crack
 You'll take the lead
 
 :
 Jingle bells, jingle bells
 Jingle all the way
 What fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh
 
 Hey
 Jingle bells, jingle bells
 Jingle jingle all the way
 What fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh
 Jingle bells, jingle bells
 Jingle jingle all the way
 What fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh
 Jingle bells
 Jingle all the way
 What fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh
 Jingle bells
 Jingle all the way
 What fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh
 
 I'm just crazy about horses
 
 Joshua Giraffe was born in a zoo
 He lived there, too, for two years
 And a half he hasn't had a bath
 My mommy doesn't lick me
 Even when I'm sticky from
 Candy floss, candy apples, popcorn
 Soft drinks, jelly beans and gumdrops
 And there must be something better
 Than living in this cage
 But I'm really not too sure
 Because I'm rather short of age
 
 Joshua Giraffe was feeling kind of sad
 Things were going bad
 How little of life he had
 Wasting away with no room to play
 Trapped in a zoo with buffalo poo
 So he went next door to the elephant
 And asked him what to do
 I'm wasting away with no room to play
 I'm trapped in a zoo, with buffalo poo
 The elephant was very old and gray
 And he had a huge balloon bottom
 He said, Never fear Joshua
 A vision will appear
 
 That night a dream came to Joshua and
 Joshua saw animals, like crazy monkeys
 And a whole pile of
 Hippypotostropasuses
 And flitty moths, frogs size twelve
 And sleazy lizards
 And a tribe of nasty saviars
 But Joshua wasn't afraid
 Because he sang himself this song
 
 Nothing can go wrong-o
 I'm in the Congo
 Nothing can go wrong-o
 I'm in the Congo
 Nothing can go wrong-o
 I'm in the Congo
 Nothing can go wrong-o
 I'm in the Congo
 Nothing can go wrong-o
 I'm in the Congo
 Nothing can go wrong-o
 I'm in the Congo
 
 Even in his dream he knew
 He'd never get away
 Not even for a day
 Then a peanut hit him on the nose
 Joshua Giraffe was back in the zoo
 What could he do
 Awakened from his dream
 He'd never be the same
 Because of things he'd seen
 He'd seen
 Alligators, crocodiles, tree sloths
 Anacondas, cobras and
 Large winged moths
 Orangutans, baboons eating grapes
 Gibbons, rude mandrills and just plain apes
 
 But Joshua was lucky
 He had some special friends
 And that day they went to the zoo
 But he was up tight so they waited till the night
 And they chopped his cage in two
 He discovered he could fly and
 He soared into the sky with them
 Wrapped around his neck
 And they haven't come back yet
 So if you see them get a net
 
 That's right, they haven't come back yet
 But when they do, they say they are
 Going to free all the animals from their cages
 No matter how new or modern
 Even some pets, too
 So if on your way home today
 You happen to find
 
 A baboon basking in the balcony
 Or a lion licking a lemon in the lobby
 Or a python perched in the pantry
 A wildebeest in the W.C
 With a turtle twirling in your tub
 Don't be afraid, just say you're a friend
 Of their friend
 
 Joshua Giraffe, Joshua, Joshua
 Joshua Giraffe, Joshua, Joshua, woo hoo
 Joshua Giraffe, Joshua, Joshua
 Joshua Giraffe, Joshua, Joshua, woo hoo
 Joshua Giraffe, Joshua, Joshua
 Joshua Giraffe, Joshua, Joshua, woo hoo

 Just like the birds that keep on flying
 Just like the wind that keeps on blowing
 I see a wave of oceans rolling on and on
 Just like the sun, these gifts are here for everyone
 
 Just like the trees that keep on giving
 Just like the grass that keeps on growing
 I hear the sound of children singing on and on
 Just like the sun, these gifts are here for everyone
 
 Just as the flowers keep on blooming
 Just like the leaves that keep on turning
 I feel the change of seasons flowing on and on
 Just like the sun, these gifts are here for everyone
 
 Just like the moon that keeps on shining
 Just like the stars that keep on twinkling
 I know a world of wonders playing on and on
 Just like the sun, these gifts are here for everyone
 
 The earth is my home
 I promise to keep it healthy and beautiful
 I will love the land the air the water
 And all living creatures
 I will be a defender of my planet
 United with friends
 I will save the earth
 
 United with friends, I promise to keep it
 United with friends, I will love the land
 United with friends, I'll be a defender
 I will save the earth
 
 United with friends, I promise to keep it
 United with friends, I will love the land
 United with friends, I'll be a defender
 I will save the earth
 
 I will save the earth
 
 There came a girl from France
 Who didn't know how to dance
 The only thing that she could do was
 Knees up Mother Brown
 
 Oh, knees up Mother Brown
 Knees up Mother Brown
 Knees up, knees up, never let the breeze up,
 Knees up Mother Brown
 
 Oh, hopping on one foot
 Hopping on one foot
 Hopping, hopping, never stopping
 Hopping on one foot

 Knees up, knees up, never let the breeze up,

 Oh, hopping on the other

 Hopping, hopping, never stopping
 Hopping on the other
 
 And whirling round and round
 Whirling round and round
 Whirling, whirling, never twirling
 Whirling round and round
 
 There came a girl from France
 Who didn't know how to dance
 The only thing that she could do was
 Knees up Mother Brown

 We got a voice, so let's make some noise
 
 Sing something high, Sing something low
 Sing something joyful, sing it round and round
 Sing something high, Sing something low
 All of us singing, let's make some noise
 
 Clap something once, clap something twice
 Clap something happy, clap it right out loud
 Clap something once, clap something twice
 All of us clapping, let's make some noise
 
 Shake something left, shake something right
 Shaking and dancing, moving round and round
 Shake something left, shake something right

 Mmm
 
 
 You came in to this world, you were shrieking and crying
 Blind to the miracle all around you
 Like a turned-loose slave whose freedom astounds him
 Reaching out for someone to comfort you
 
 Pretty soon, you'll be filling out your eyes with questions
 Not knowing who brought you here or why
 And you can spend the better part of your life inquiring
 Much to pre-occupied to see it slips by
 
 Little Kristin January 28
 There's no one person here to set you straight
 There's no clear avenue out of the gate
 But you know your uncle's pulling for you all the way
 Praying for sunshine to fill your day
 He's wishing your love in abundance
 And simple contentment
 
 Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
 Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
 Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh
 
 I want to come and serenade you
 I want cuddle and hold you
 Show you all the animals at the zoo
 Take you on my shoulders as I watch you getting older
 Try and guess the riddles that you put me through
 
 I'm gladly trade you a frog and a whole bunch of marbles
 To stand for a instant inside your shoes
 And Kristin, I'm hoping that you'll save me a secret
 One special secret just for me and you

 There's a little white duck sitting in the water
 Little white duck doing what he oughta
 He took a bite of a lily pad
 Flapped his wings and he said, "I'm glad"
 That I'm a little white duck sitting in the water
 Quack, quack, quack
 
 There's a little green frog swimming in the water
 Little green frog doing what he oughta
 He jumped right off of the lily pad
 That the little duck bit and he said, "I'm glad"
 That I'm a little green frog swimming in the water
 Gulp, gulp, gulp
 
 There's a little black bug floating on the water
 A little black bug doing what he oughta
 He tickled the frog on the lily pad
 That the little duck bit and he said, "I'm glad"
 That I'm a little black bug floating on the water
 Quick, quick, quick
 
 There's a little red snake lying in the water
 A little red snake doing what he oughta
 He frightened the duck and the frog so bad
 And he ate the little bug and he said, "I'm glad"
 That I'm a little red snake lying in the water
 Sss, sss, sss
 
 And now there's nobody left left sitting in the water
 Nobody left doing what he oughta
 Nothing left but the lily pad
 The duck and the frog ran away
 There's nobody left sitting in the water
 Boo, hoo, hoo
 
 Because of the snake that ate the bug
 That tickled the frog, that went kerchug
 There's nobody left to sing about alas and alak
 Not even the little white duck
 Quack, quack, quack, quack
 
 Out of heaven's boundless space
 This love song comes to me
 Moves my mind to singing of feelings I hide.
 The timeless smile upon your face
 Is all I need to see
 To make me feel I'm only 6 years old inside.
 
 Every time I see the light
 Come sparkling in your eyes.
 It holds me still and melts my blues away.
 Though many maybe near to me,
 Your love's the one I prize
 Started until the end of every day.
 
 Whoa, oh, oh
 Can't you see the love light in my eyes?
 
 There was a time when songs of sadness
 Roamed around my head.
 They lingered in my bed and held me
 All through the night.
 My spirit was alone
 I had no one to set me free
 Of my hunger for affection
 And a warm face to touch.
 
 But now all of that is changed,
 Someone must have heard me in my dreams.
 No one behold they come true.
 The one that I was longing for
 Has coming to my view.
 Darling, you know it's you.
 
 Whoa, oh, oh
 Can't you see the love light in my eyes?
 
 By heaven's grace may fortune's favors
 Keep our spirits hide
 May we never come to see the day
 That drinks our visions dry
 In hunger and in plenty
 May we never stray from love
 And may she guide us on this journey
 We know so little love.
 
 May your child like wisdom
 Always sing its song to me
 Constant as your love song plentiful
 And fancy free.
 And everywhere I roam,
 Let me find a harbor close to you
 Let the evening breezes blow
 My love around to you.
 
 Whoa, oh, oh
 Can't you see the love light in my eyes?
 Whoa, oh, oh
 Can't you see the love light in my eyes?
 Whoa, oh, oh
 Can't you see the love light in my eyes?
 Whoa, oh, oh
 Can't you see the love light in my eyes?
 Can't, can't you see the love light in my eyes?
 Ooh, can't you see the love light in my eyes?
 
 Mary wore her red dress, red dress, red dress

 Bright blue the sky.
 Sun up on high'
 That was the little boy's picture
 He drew for you
 Wrote for you, too
 Just to make clear what he drew.
 
 May there always be sunshine,	
 May there always be blue skies,
 May there always be mummy,
 May there always be me!
 
 My little friend,
 Listen, my friend,
 Peace is the dream of the people
 Hearts old and young
 Never have done
 Singing the song you have sung.
 
 Soldier lad, stay!
 Hear what we say'
 War would make all of us losers
 Peace is our prize
 Millions of eyes
 Anxiously gaze at the skies.
 
 Down with all war!
 We want no more.
 People stand up for you children
 Sing everyone
 Peace must be won,
 Dark clouds must not hide the sun.
 
 Sun in thy sky,
 Birds flying by
 This is the picture 
 You gave me
 Far down below
 Someone I know
 Looked up as though he would say
 
 There could be sun
 For everyone
 There could be worlds 
 Filled with laughter
 Peace is a dream
 How close it seems
 When you hold my hand and say

 Train whistle blowing
 Makes a sleepy noise
 Underneath their blankets
 Go all the girls and boys.
 
 Heading from the station
 Out along the bay
 All bound for Morningtown
 Many miles away.
 
 Sarah's at the engine
 Tony rings the bell
 John swings a lantern
 To show that all is well.
 
 Rock-n-roll and riding
 Out along the bay
 All bound for Morningtown
 Many miles away.
 
 Maybe it is raining
 Where our train will ride
 But all the little travelers
 Are snug and warm inside.
 
 Somewhere there is sunshine
 Somewhere there is day
 Somewhere there is Morningtown
 Many miles away.

 I have a little dreydel
 I made it out of clay
 And when it's dry and ready
 My dreydel I will play
 
 Dreydel, dreydel, dreydel
 I made it out of clay
 Dreydel, dreydel, dreydel
 My dreydel I will play
 
 There are lots of things for me to do
 On my way home, I'll tell you a few
 I can watch a squirrel climb up a tree
 Or make a buzz like a bumblebee
 And that's what I might do today
 On my way home
 
 When it's pouring, and it rained outside
 Sometimes I wanna stay in and hide
 But with boots and raincoat, I'm okay
 Splashing in the puddles, don't get in my way
 'Cause that's what I might do today
 On my way home
 
 When it's cold and snow is on the ground
 I can go to the hill and slide right down
 Make a snow angel or build a snowman
 Have some hot chocolate and do it again
 And that's what I might do today
 On my way home
 
 And when it's hot I'm in sneakers and shorts
 I can play tag or build some forts
 I can walk alone or with my friends
 Making up a song that never ends
 That's what I might do today
 On my way home
 Yes that's what I might do today
 On my way home

 Oats and beans and barley grow,
 Oats and beans and barley grow,
 Do you or I or anyone know
 How oats and beans and barley grow?
 
 First the farmer plants the seeds,
 Stands up tall and takes his ease,
 Stamps his feet and claps his hands,
 And turns around to view his land.
 
 Oats and beans and barley grow,

 I'd like to be under the sea
 In an octopus's garden in the shade
 He'd let us in, knows where we've been
 In his octopus's garden in the shade
 
 I'd ask my friends to come and see
 An octopus's garden with me
 
 I'd like to be under the sea
 In an octopus's garden in the shade
 
 We would be warm below the storm
 In our little hideaway beneath the waves
 Restin' our head on the sea bed
 In an octopus's garden near a cave
 
 We would sing and dance around
 Because we know we can't be found
 
 I'd like to be under the sea
 In an octopus's garden in the shade
 
 We would shout and swim about
 The coral that lies beneath the waves
 Lies beneath the ocean waves
 Oh, what joy, for every girl and boy
 Knowing we're happy and we're safe
 Happy and we're safe
 
 We would be so happy you and me
 No one there to tell us what to do
 
 I'd like to be under the sea
 In an octopus's garden with you
 In an octopus's garden with you
 In an octopus's garden with you

 But I know what, and so do you
 I don't need a dinosaur to eat me up
 No, you don't need a dinosaur to eat you up
 
 Oh me, oh my! What'll I do?
 I don't have a radio to sing a song
 But I know what, and so do you
 I don't need a radio to sing a song
 No, you don't need a radio to sing a song

 Old toy trains
 Little toy tracks
 Little toy drums
 Coming from a sack
 Carried by a man
 Dressed
 In white and red
 Little one
 Don't you think
 It's time
 You were in bed?
 
 Close your eyes
 Listen
 To the skies
 All is calm
 All is well
 Soon you'll hear
 Kris Kringle
 And his
 Jingle bells
 
 Bringing
 Old toy trains
 Little toy tracks
 Little toy drums
 Coming from a sack
 Carried by a man
 Dressed
 In white and red
 Little one
 Don't you think
 It's time
 You were in bed?
 
 Close your eyes
 Listen
 To the skies
 All is calm
 All is well
 Soon you'll hear
 Kris Kringle
 And his
 Jingle bells
 
 Bringing
 Old toy trains
 Little toy tracks
 Little toy drums
 Coming from a sack
 Carried by a man
 Dressed
 In white and red
 Little one
 Don't you think
 It's time
 You were in bed?
 
 Waiting throughout the year
 For Christmas morning to be here
 And counting how many days
 Till Christmas morning, drawing near
 
 On Christmas morning I'll wake up bright and early
 Be the first one out of bed
 With the mistletoe above my head
 
 On Christmas morning we can sing and celebrate
 And make the feeling stay
 All through the day
 
 Presents under the tree
 There's one from me to you and you to me
 Family and friends are here
 On the very best morning of the year
 
 On Christmas morning I'll wake up bright and early
 Be the first one out of bed
 With the mistletoe above my head
 
 On Christmas morning we can sing and celebrate
 And make the feeling stay
 All through the day
 
 On Christmas morning I'll wake up bright and early
 Be the first one out of bed
 With the mistletoe above my head
 
 On Christmas morning we can sing and celebrate
 And make the feeling stay
 All through the day
 
 One light, one sun
 One sun lighting everyone
 One world turning
 One world turning everyone
 
 One world, one home
 One world home for everyone
 One dream, one song
 One song heard by everyone
 
 One love and it's one heart
 One heart warming everyone
 One hope and one joy
 One loving filling everyone
 
 One light, one sun
 One sun lighting everyone
 One heart warming everyone
 
 Out in the yard, blissed out, pissed out
 His care upon the snow
 See it change color and melt away
 Oh, what a lovely day to lie around the house
 Scarcely a mouse to be chasing
 But that's not his 'cause,
 Simply because he's a dog.
 Bow-wow-wow-wow
 
 Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow
 Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow
 Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow
 Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow
 Bow-wow-wow
 
 One lick of his tongue, and I'm in heaven
 The look on his face just sends me
 And up there I stay happy to play with
 My little dog, not another like him
 36 pounds of heart and soul
 Personal friend someone to tell my troubles to.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
 
 He wakes me in the morning
 Barking in the break of day
 Then suddenly it kiss me in a most definitional way
 Hey, hey, hey
 Some people dig gold, others fancy diamonds
 Speaking for me, I'm just crazy
 Crazy 'bout my puppy and he's just crazy about me
 
 Raffi:  Here, boy.
 
 Over in the meadow
 In a pond in the sun
 Lived an old mother duck
 And her little duck one
 "Quack!" said the mother
 "Quack!" said the one
 And they quacked and were happy
 In the pond in the sun
 
 Over in the meadow
 In a stream so blue
 Lived an old mother fish
 And her little fish two
 "Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop!" said the mother
 "Bloop, bloop!" said the two
 And they swam and were happy
 In the stream so blue
 
 Over in the meadow
 In a nest in the tree
 Lived an old mother bird
 And her birdies three
 "Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet!" said the mother
 "Tweet, tweet, tweet!" said the three
 And they sang and were happy
 In the nest in the tree
 
 Over in the meadow
 On a rock by the shore
 Lived and old mother frog
 And her little frogs four
 "Ribbit!" said the mother
 "Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!" said the four
 And they croaked and were happy
 On the rock by the shore
 
 Over in the meadow
 In a big beehive
 Lived and old mother bee
 And little bees five
 "Bzzzup!" said the mother
 "Bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz!" said the five
 And the buzzed and were happy
 In the big beehive
 
 Over in the meadow
 In the noon day sun
 There was a pretty mother
 And her baby one
 "Listen," said the mother
 "To the ducks and the bees
 To the frogs and the fish
 And the birds in the trees."
 
 "Bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz!" said the five
 "Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!" said the four
 "Tweet, tweet, tweet!" said the three
 "Bloop, bloop!" said the two
 "Quack!" said the one
 And the little baby laughed
 Just to hear such fun!

 But the best witch that I've ever had was
 A peanut butter sandwich made with jam
 Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum

 As I step in from the sidewalk
 On a rainy Friday night
 The bar sure does look crowded
 It's just aching for a fight
 Some folks will come to drink for fun
 But for most, it isn't so
 They're in here escaping from their lives
 In the only way they know
 
 And I'm singing cowboy chords to jukebox crowds
 On a rainy Friday night
 Looking for a smile or a tear
 Thinking may the Lord be with you
 When you're sober once again
 May you wake one Sunday morning
 To find a new song to sing
 
 19-year old Nancy
 Has some bruises to explain
 She says her old man had been drinking
 And he beat her up again
 The time would heal her handcuff marks
 If a friend would only listen
 Nancy says she hopes her man
 Will have her pregnant by the spring
 
 And I'm singing cowboy chords to jukebox crowds
 On a rainy Friday night
 Looking for a smile or a tear
 Thinking may the Lord be with you
 When you're sober once again
 May you wake one Sunday morning
 To find a new song to sing
 
 And I'm singing cowboy chords to jukebox crowds
 On a rainy Friday night
 Looking for a smile or a tear
 Thinking may the Lord be with you
 When you're sober once again
 May you wake one Sunday morning
 To find a new song to sing
 
 And over there I hear some words of love
 Then they're turned the words of hate
 And if you think this place is jumping now, friend
 Just come back when it gets late
 And Gus the waiter has these visions
 But they're only in his dreams
 White-haired Beverly's burdened bladder
 Is bursting at its seams
 
 And I'm singing cowboy chords to jukebox crowds
 On a rainy Friday night
 Looking for a smile or a tear
 Thinking may the Lord be with you
 When you're sober once again
 May you wake one Sunday morning
 To find a new song to sing
 
 You put the oil in the pot
 And you let it get hot
 You put the popcorn in
 And you start to grin
 Sizzle sizzle, sizzle sizzle
 Sizzle sizzle, sizzle sizzle
 Sizzle sizzle, sizzle sizzle
 Pop

 Rainstorm is not a song, it's a sound that Raffi and his friends do together.
 
 Riding in an airplane
 High above the ground
 Flying to a new place
 Underneath the sun
 
 Looking out my window
 At the beauty down below
 Shimmering in sunlight
 I see the rivers on the go
 
 Chocolate-covered farms
 With the food the farmer grows
 Waiting for a rain cloud
 To come along and drop its load
 
 Yippie-i-oh, yippie-i-yay
 Flying in the sunset
 At the closing of the day
 
 And I'm riding in an airplane 
 High above the ground 
 Flying to a new place 
 Underneath the sun 
 
 The lights of the city
 Start to twinkle up ahead
 And pretty soon we'll touch down
 Just before it's time for bed
 
 Yippie-i-oh, yippie-i-yay
 Flying in the sunset

 Hey, hey, hey, I'm flying to a new place

 Ripple of love, little bluepond
 Making waves, inside out
 Shimmering seed, in every heart
 Radiant light, ripple of love
 Circling rings, reaching out
 Sounding waves, far and wide
 Sparkling seeds, turning round
 Ripple of love, homeward bound
 Ripple of love, little bluepond
 Making waves, inside out
 Radiant light, ripple of love
 Radiant light, ripple of love
 A seed and a ripple and a moving ring
 Tuning the heart of everything
 
 Rise with the blue bird
 Shine like the sun
 Now is time to rise and shine
 
 Rise and shine
 The world's been turning
 Everyone is waking
 
 Rise and shine
 On this new day the morning
 Light is breaking
 
 Rise with the rest of us
 Shine like a pearl
 Rise and show your love
 All around the world
 
 Ooh, rise with the blue bird
 Shine like the sun
 Now is the time to rise and shine
 
 Rise and shine
 Today is calling and
 This is what it saying
 
 Rise and shine
 Your friends are waking
 It's time for work and playing
 
 Rise with the rest of us
 Shine like a pearl
 Rise and show your love
 All around the world
 
 Ooh rise with the blue bird
 Shine like the sun
 Now is the time to rise and shine
 Yes, now is the time to rise and shine
 
 Robin in the rain
 What a saucy fellow
 Robin in the rain
 Mind your socks of yellow
 Running in the garden on your nimble feet
 Digging for your dinner with your long strong beak
 
 Robin in the rain
 You don't mind the weather
 Showers always make you gay
 But the worms are wishing you would stay at home

 Row, row, row your boat
 Gently down the stream
 Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
 Life is but a dream
 
 You know 
 There's Dasher 
 And Dancer
 Prancer and Vixen
 Comet and Cupid
 Donner and Blitzen
 But do you recall
 The most famous 
 Reindeer of all?
 
 Rudolph 
 The Red-Nosed Reindeer
 Had a very shiny nose
 And if you ever saw him
 You would even say it glows
 
 All of the other reindeer
 Used to laugh 
 And call him names
 They never let poor Rudolph
 Join in any reindeer games
 
 Then one foggy Christmas Eve
 Santa came to say
 "Rudolph with your nose so bright
 Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
 
 Then how the reindeer loved him
 As they shouted out with glee
 "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
 You'll go down in history"

 There was and old woman of skin and bones
 Uh uh uh uh
 She lived down by the old grave yard
 Uh uh uh uh
 One night she thought she'd take a walk
 Uh uh uh uh
 She walk down by the old grave yard
 Uh uh uh uh
 She saw the bones a'laying around
 Uh uh uh uh
 She went to the closet to get her broom
 Oh oh oh oh
 She opened the door and
 Boo
 
 Maybe it's the time of year
 Summer's still waiting to call
 Winter's somehow left behind
 Can't make up its mind
 And everything you believe in
 Comes tumbling down
 
 Instead of sleeping you'll be staying up all night
 Lying awake all day
 Hoping that everything will be alright
 But your body don't work that way
 
 And so you say you're always on the losing end
 Feeling lost in a crowd
 But you're lonely when you're by yourself
 Maybe that's just as well
 'Cause you can't always count on someone
 To lend a helping hand
 
 Sometimes when I get feeling low
 Wondering why this world would treat me this way
 I think of people and places that make me smile
 And it don't matter how you hard you try
 You can't hold the world on your shoulders, no
 You could say we're all doing our best to get by
 
 Only fools could promise you good times
 But I can only try to put things right
 So dim the lights, pull the shades
 Maybe we both could get some sleep tonight
 
 
 As I was going out for a walk
 But not go further than half a block
 Trouble with my foot
 Ooh, there is something in my shoe
 So I took it off and shook it
 Well, look at, look at, look at
 You know what fell out? 
 A little wee stone 
 So I put my shoe back on my feet
 And kept on walking down the street
 
 Well, as I was going to the store
 One step, two step, three step, four
 Trouble with my foot
 Ooh, there is something in my shoe
 So I took it off and shook it
 Well, look at, look at, look at
 You know what fell out? 
 A bouncing ball 
 And a little wee stone 
 So I put my shoe back on my feet
 And kept on walking down the street
 
 Well, as I was driving in my car
 But I couldn't drive very far
 Trouble with my foot
 Ooh, there is something in my shoe
 So I took it off and shook it
 Well, look at, look at, look at
 You know what fell out? 
 A flying bird 
 A bouncing ball 
 And a little wee stone 
 So I put my shoe back on my feet
 And kept on driving down the street
 
 I went home and stood on the kitchen floor
 I didn't think I've had it any more
 Trouble with my foot
 Ooh, there is something in my shoe
 So I took it off and shook it
 Well, look at, look at, look at
 You know what fell out? 
 A locomotive 
 A flying bird 
 A bouncing ball 
 And a little wee stone 
 So I went into my room with bare feet
 Climbed into bed and went to sleep
 
 There's a spider on the floor, on the floor.

 There's a spider on the floor, on the floor.
 Who could ask for any more?

 In this big city, you'll often hear
 The sounds of Starvin' Marvin,
 The latest country folk rock hero
 They're trying so hard to push.
 He's a talented boy with a musical toy
 And a heart that don't stop feeling.
 In a minute or two, I will tell it to you
 Why they call him Starvin' Marvin.
 
 First, I'd like to say how I used to enjoy
 His ways with words in a song.
 And he used to play his guitar so cleanly
 I could listen to him all night long.
 When he sang to you, the songs got through--
 Brought you up real close.
 And you didn't even mind the manners
 Of his slightly artistic pose.
 
 But the jobs were few, the day was poor
 He and his woman went hungry
 Constantly broke, surrounded by wealth,
 Was enough to make him feel so lonely.
 Humble in his place was the look upon his face,
 Marvin was constantly fighting.
 And his music showed the pain of a tough-skin man
 Whose tenderness was always hiding.
 
 But then one day, his luck had changed.
 He brought the bosses to his door.
 They must have done a lot of slick fast suite talking
 Who swept them right off of his floor
 The moral brought an album and a flashy pair of pants
 And stardom on the radio.
 And from that day forth, he's been a much-changed boy
 From the one we used to know.
 
 Starvin' Marvin, former tough luck kid,
 Lame duff folk rock star.
 Have you forgotten what it felt like years ago
 To remember just who you are? 
 Can't you, just for once, drop your halo hat
 And touch the ground you're standing on?
 Look back to the things that were dear to you
 Or soon they'll be long, long gone.
 
 Long gone. Long gone.
 
 Now he struts around with his petty entourage
 And carrying his robes behind him.
 And when you're talking to the man, though you're with him face to face,
 You don't know where to find him.
 You sometimes hear a mention of hungry days
 Not only just enough to impress you.
 And the lessons that he's learned are the dollars that he's earned
 And he's only got time to forget you.
 And the dollars that he's earned are the lessons that he's learned
 And he's only got time to forget you.
 
 Starvin' Marvin, former tough luck kid,
 Lame duff folk rock star.
 Have you forgotten what it felt like years ago

 Look back to the things that were dear to you

 Long, long, long gone. 
 Long, long, long gone. 
 Long, long, long gone. 
 Long, long, long gooooonnnnne. 
 Long gone, long gone, long gone, long gone, long gone, long gone)
 
 Have you seen the old man
 Outside the closed-down market
 Kicking up papers
 In old worn out shoes?
 In his eyes you see no pride
 And held loosely at his side
 Yesterday's paper with yesterday's news
 
 Have you seen the old girl
 Walking along the streets of London
 Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
 She has no time for talking
 She just keeps right on walking
 Carrying her world in two paper bags
 
 Then how can you tell me you're lonely
 And say for you the sun don't shine?
 Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
 I'll show you something to make you change your mind
 
 In an all night cafe
 At a quarter past eleven
 There sits an old, old man all by himself
 Gazing at the world
 Pass the rim of his teacup
 Each tea last an hour
 Then he wanders home alone
 
 Then how can you tell me you're lonely
 And say for you the sun don't shine?
 Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
 I'll show you something to make you change your mind
 
 Have you seen the old man
 Outside the seaman's mission
 His memory faded like
 The medals that he wears
 In our winter city,
 The rain cries a little pity
 One more forgotten hero
 And a world that doesn't care
 
 Then how can you tell me you're lonely
 And say for you the sun don't shine?
 Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
 I'll show you something that's just bound to change your mind
 Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
 I'll show you something to make you change your mind
 
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 
 I looked over Jordan and what did I see
 Comin' for to carry me home
 I saw a band of angels comin' after me
 Comin' for to carry me home
 
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 
 If you get to heaven before I do
 Comin' for to carry me home
 You tell all my friends I'll be comin' there too
 Comin' for to carry me home
 
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 Swing low, sweet chariot
 Comin' for to carry me home
 Comin' for to carry me home
 Comin' for to carry me home
 
 Take me out to the ballgame
 Take me out with the crowd
 Buy me some peanuts and crackerjack
 I don't care if I ever get back
 With a root, root, root for the home team
 If they don't win, it's a shame
 For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out
 At the old ball game
 
 If you're looking for a buddy with a hug to share,
 And everybody around is too busy to care,
 Don't you fuss and worry, don't you run and hide under the rug,
 You go and find your teddy and give that bear a great, big, hug;
 
 Teddy Bear Hug
 When you really need it
 Teddy Bear Hug
 Carry something furry
 Teddy Bear Hug
 Teddy's always ready with a bear hug just for you-ou.

 I like to go bowling with my friend Bert
 A bowling ball and a bowling shirt
 I like roll the ball down the lane
 On a good day, I'll throw a few strikes
 Or maybe some spares, well, that's what I like
 Bowling is my kind of game
 
 I aim for the 1 pin, 2 pin, 3 pin, 4,
 5 pins down the lane
 With a boom and a bang they hit the floor 
 And I throw that ball again.
 
 I like to go bowling with my friend Bert
 A bowling ball and a bowling shirt
 Bowling is my kind of game.
 
 I aim for the 6 pin, 7 pin, 8 pin, 9,
 10 pins down the lane
 I throw that ball when I reach the line
 And knock them down again.

 Mr. Bell's from a foreign place
 His family all were farmers
 He arrived from across the sea
 And came to be next door
 
 And he works his land
 With a knowing hand
 Though it's very small
 He makes it grow so well
 In the changing garden of Mr. Bell
 
 These are astors and edelweiss
 And rows and rows of roses
 Those are hives in the dogwood trees
 For bees to come and go
 
 It's a wondrous site
 In the morning light
 And the earth is full
 Every color every smell
 In the changing garden of Mr. Bell
 
 I once saw a photograph upon his mantle shelf
 Of a beautiful lady a child in her arms
 And a young Mr. Bell himself
 I wondered out loud about them
 And he answered in the strangest way
 He just said look: see how the garden grows
 It's always changing every day
 
 Mr. Bell has his morning tea
 And I will bring his paper
 See the sun through the curtain lace
 Dapple his face and hands
 
 Every day is new
 There is much to do
 Life's a mystery
 Full of secrets that might tell
 In the changing garden of Mr. Bell
 In the changing garden of Mr. Bell
 
 There was cheese, cheese, walkin' on its knees
 In the store, in the store
 There was cheese, cheese, walkin' on its knees
 In the corner grocery store
 
 My eyes are dim, I cannot see,
 I have not brought my specs with me
 I have not brought my specs with me
 
 There were plums, plums, twiddling their thumbs
 In the store, in the store
 There were plums, plums, twiddling their thumbs
 In the corner grocery store
 
 My eyes are dim, I cannot see,
 I have not brought my specs with me
 I have not brought my specs with me
 
 There was corn, corn, blowin' on a horn
 In the store, in the store
 There was corn, corn, blowin' on a horn
 In the corner grocery store
 
 There were beans, beans, trying on some jeans
 In the store, in the store
 There were beans, beans, trying on some jeans
 In the corner grocery store
 
 My eyes are dim, I cannot see
 I have not brought my specs with me
 I have not brought my specs with me
 
 There was more, more, just inside the door
 In the store, in the store
 There was more, much more, just inside the door
 In the corner grocery store
 
 The first Noel, the angels say
 To Bethlehem's shepherds as they lay.
 At midnight watch, when keeping sheep,
 The winter wild, the light snow deep.
 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
 Born is the King of Israel.
 
 The shepherds rose, and saw a star
 Bright in the East, beyond them far,
 Its beauty gave them great delight,
 This star it set now day nor night.
 
 Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
 Born is the King of Israel.

 The time that she left me
 It was the worst I'd ever seen her
 Tears had all dried up
 She showed no trace of feeling
 I could not believe a face so pretty
 Could ever turn so cold
 I saw the brilliance in her big brown eyes
 Suddenly gold
 
 For my part in loving you
 I had reasons by the dozen
 Like you were weak and young
 Thinking only of me
 For my part in hurting you
 I had excuses by the score
 Like I was weak and young
 Thinking only of you
 Well, I'm still thinking only of you
 Thinking of you
 
 I feel like growing up all of my bad songs
 Into one real good one
 The other in the bits of pieces
 To give it one more try
 Tearing up all of the bad verse
 To sing you a new line
 Sharing that old feeling just one more time
 Would make me feel so fine
 
 For my part in loving you
 I had reasons by the dozen
 Like you were weak and young
 Thinking only of me
 For my part in hurting you
 I had excuses by the score
 Like I was weak and young
 Thinking only of you
 Well, I'm still thinking only of you
 Thinking of you

 Than my toe, than my toe

 And you'll grow, and you'll grow, and you'll grow

 Up above the world so high,
 Like a diamond in the sky.
 Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
 How I wonder what you are!
 
 First you say you do, and then you don't
 Then you say you will, and then you won't
 You're undecided now
 So what are you gonna do?
 
 Now you say you'll play, and then it's no
 Then you say you'll stay, but that's when you go
 You're undecided now
 So what are you gonna do?
 
 I've been sitting on a fence, and it doesn't make much sense
 'Cause you keep me in suspense, and you know it
 Then you promise to return, when you don't I really burn
 I guess I'll never learn and I show it
 
 But if you've got a heart and if you're kind
 Don't keep us apart, make up your mind
 You're undecided now
 So what are you gonna do with me, baby?

 But if you've got a heart and if you're kind
 Don't keep us apart, make up your mind
 You're undecided now

 I see them bloom for me and you
 And I think to myself
 Oh, what a wonderful world.

 The bright blessed day and the dark sacred night
 And I think to myself

 The colors of the rainbow
 So pretty in the sky
 Are also on the faces
 Of people walkin' by
 
 I see friends shakin' hands
 Sayin', "How do you do?"
 They're really sayin'
 "I love you"
 
 I see babies cryin', I watch them grow
 They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
 And I think to myself
 Mm, what a wonderful world.

 Now didn't old Noah build the Ark?
 He built it out of hickory bark.
 
 He built it long, both wide and tall,
 Plenty of room for the large and the small
 
 Well, who built the Ark? Noah, Noah,
 Who built the Ark? Brother Noah built the Ark
 
 In came the animals two by two
 Hippopotamus and kangaroo
 
 In came the animals three by three
 Two big cats and a bumblebee
 
 In came the animals four by four
 Two through the window and two through the door
 
 In came the animals five by five
 Five little sparrows, doin' the jive
 
 Well, who built the Ark? Noah, Noah
 Who built the Ark? Brother Noah built the Ark
 
 In came the animals six by six
 The elephant laughed at the monkey's tricks
 
 In came the animals seven by seven
 Four from home and the rest from heaven
 
 In came the animals eight by eight
 Some were on time and the others were late
 
 In came the animals nine by nine
 Some were shoutin' and some were cryin'
 
 In came the animals ten by ten
 Five black roosters and five black hens
 
 Then Noah says, "Go and shut that door,
 The rain's started dropping and we can't take more!"
 
 Well, who built the Ark? Noah, Noah,
 Who built the Ark? Brother Noah built the Ark
 
 Will I ever grow up, Mama?
 Will I ever grow up, Papa?
 Will I ever grow up to be like you
 So big and strong?
 
 Will I ever grow up, Mama?
 Do you think that I can, Papa?
 Will I ever grow up to be like you?
 Say that I will.
 
 Can I be a grown-up, too
 Doing things that grown-ups do
 Going off to work one day
 All by myself?
 
 Will I have a grown-up choice 
 Wearing grown-up clothes,
 And with babes of all my own?
 Then my family's home.
 
 Will I ever grow up, Mama?
 Will I ever grow up, Papa?
 Will I ever grow up to be like you
 So big and strong?
 
 Will I ever grow up, Mama?
 Do you think that I can, Papa?
 Will I ever grow up to be like you?
 Say that I will.
 
 Will I ever grow up?
 Can I be just like you?...
 Say that I will.

 You know, I'm working town to town
 One week here then another
 Really wouldn't do
 I only see it time to time
 Phone call or a message
 I'd never get to you
 
 But every time the wind blows over the bay
 And rain can cloud the sun away
 I'll find myself still thinking
 We should have stayed together.
 Oh, we should have stayed together.
 
 Then you're younger
 I know that's not your fault
 It's not suppose to matter
 But there's things you've got to do
 Mistakes you've got to make
 To find who's really you
 
 But every time the wind blows over the bay
 And rain can cloud the sun away
 I'll find myself still thinking
 We should have stayed together.
 Oh, we should have stayed together.
 
 I happened by to your place the other day
 I just dropped by to see
 How things were going
 But you don't live there now
 I know there's no use asking everyone
 Where or how
 
 But every time the wind blows over the bay
 And rain can cloud the sun away
 I'll find myself still thinking
 We should have stayed together. 
 
 Yes, every time the wind blows over the bay
 And rain can cloud the sun away
 I'll find myself still thinking
 We should have stayed together. 
 We should have stayed together. 
 We should have stayed together. 
 We should have stayed together. 
 We should have stayed together. 
 We should have stayed together. 
 We should have stayed together.
 
 Wish I were a child again
 Right back in my mama's arms
 With the big kids in this world acting so crazy
 I wish I were a little boy.
 When I was 2, I felt so secure
 Plumped but happy, naive and but self-assured.
 And now all this growing up stuff just leave me dizzy
 And I wish I was a little boy.
 
 Sand in the sandbox, a bathtub and a boat
 Chew a bunch of bubble gum to keep the thing a-float.
 A castle for my home, a bucket round my head
 A long day at the beach will your bum red.
 Room and board are free, the meals are served on time.
 Spend an afternoon deciding how to spend the dime.
 No worries about the rent or payments on the car.
 No need to be confused about the why of who you are.
 
 Wish I were a child again
 Right back in my mama's arms
 With the big kids in this world acting so crazy
 I wish I were a little boy.
 When I was 2, I felt so secure
 Plumped but happy, naive and but self-assured.
 And now all this growing stuff up just leave me dizzy
 And I wish I were a little boy.
 
 What used to pass for candy is now a hole inside my tooth.
 The dreams they tried to sell me were a smokescreen around the truth.
 Don't you know it takes a lot to keep from giving up?
 This day to day frustration of a bitter second cup.
 The news is all around, our world is full of fire and hate.
 It isn't all too early to sense the hour is late.
 And what kind of time is this to think of having kids?
 The future's looking shaky and the present gives me fits.
 
 I wish I were a child again
 Right back in my cuddly mama's arms
 With the big kids in this world acting so crazy
 I wish I were a little boy.
 When I was 2, I felt so secure
 Plumped but happy, naive and but self-assured.
 And now all this growing up stuff just leave me dizzy
 And I wish I was a little boy.
 Yes, I wish I were a little
 Boy.
 
 Y'a un rat dans l' grenier & Sur le pont d?Avignon
 
 Y'a un rat dans l' grenier
 J'entends le chat qui miaule,
 Y'a un rat dans l' grenier
 J'entends le chat miauler.
 J'entends, j'entends,
 J'entends le chat qui miaule,
 J'entends, j'entends, 
 J'entends le chat miauler.
 
 There's a rat in the barn,
 I hear the cat go meow,
 I hear, I hear, 
 I hear the cat meowing,
 J'entends, j'entends,
 
 J'entends le chat qui miaule.
 
 Sur le pont d?Avignon
 L'on y danse, l'on y danse
 Sur le pont d?Avignon
 L'on y danse tous en rond
 
 On the bridge of Avignon
 We all dance there, we all dance there
 On the bridge of Avignon
 We all dance there round and round.
 
 I lived with the decent folks
 In the hills of old Vermont
 Where what you do all day
 Depends on what you want
 And I took up with a woman there
 Though I was still a kid
 And I smile like the sun
 To think of the loving that we did
 
 She rose each morning and went to work
 And she kept me with her pay
 I was making love all night
 And playing guitar all day
 And I got apple cider and homemade bread
 To make a man say grace
 And clean linens on my bed
 And a warm feet fire place
 
 Yankee lady so good to me,
 Yankee lady just a memory
 Yankee lady so good to me,
 Your memory that's enough for me
 
 An autumn walk on a country road
 And a million flaming trees
 I was feeling uneasy
 Cause there was winter in the breeze
 And she said, "Oh Jesse, look over there,
 The birds are southward bound
 Oh Jesse, I'm so afraid
 To lose the love that we've found."
 
 Yankee lady so good to me,
 Yankee lady just a memory
 Yankee lady so good to me,
 Your memory that's enough for me
 
 I don't know what called to me
 But I know that I had to go
 I left that Vermont town
 With a lift to Mexico
 And now when I see myself
 As a stranger by my birth
 The Yankee lady's memory
 Reminds me of my worth
 
 Yankee lady so good to me,
 Yankee lady just a memory
 Yankee lady so good to me,
 Your memory that's enough for me
 
 In the town where I was born
 Lived a man, who sailed the sea
 And he told us of his life
 In the land of submarines
 
 So we sailed off to the sun
 Till we found a sea of green
 And we lived beneath the waves
 In our yellow submarine
 
 We all live in a yellow submarine
 Yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
 We all live in a yellow submarine
 Yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
 
 And our friends are all aboard
 Many more of them live next door
 And the band begins to play
 
 Oh, we all live in a yellow submarine
 A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
 We all live in a yellow submarine
 A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
 
 As we live a life of ease
 Everyone of us has all we need
 Sky of blue, a sea of green
 In our yellow submarine
 
 Oh, we all live in a yellow submarine
 A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
 We all live in a yellow submarine
 A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
 
 We all live in a yellow submarine
 A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
 We all live in a yellow submarine
 A yellow submarine, a yellow submarine
 
 See the Chevys row on row going by you with the flow
 As they carry all the driftwood to and fro
 See a thousand lonely faces press a thousand window panes
 Searching for a reason not to go
 
 Oh, don't you go to Yonge Street
 It's bound to waste your time
 Don't you go to Yonge Street
 It's bound to waste your time
 
 Them fancy dressing ladies they sure look so fine
 Damn near enough to drive a man insane
 Find the only girls you know in an arcade picture show
 Pay your dime and pretend they know your name
 
 Don't you go to Yonge Street
 It's bound to waste your time
 Don't you go to Yonge Street
 It's bound to waste your time
 
 Well a man sure needs a woman to help him through the night
 To keep him keeping on when time get rough
 But if I feel tomorrow the way I feel tonight
 I feel I'll probably feel I've had enough
 
 I'll probably go to Yonge Street
 Try to waste my time
 
 Trying to waste my time
 
 Waste more of my time

 Back in high school I knew a girl
 Not too simple and not too kind
 We both grew up but I heard she changed
 From a New Wave fan to another kind
 
 She thinks she's Edith Head but you might know she's not
 The accent in her speech, she didn't have growing up
 She thinks she's Edith Head or Helen Gurley Brown
 Or some other cultural figure we don't know a lot about
 
 It's been years since I moved away but at Christmas I come home
 I saw her reflection in the window of a store
 She was talking to herself. Not too simple and not too kind
 I walked on by. It was complicated and it stuck in my mind
 
 She thinks she's Edith Head but you might know she is not
 The accent in her speech, she didn't have growing up
 
 She thinks she's Edith Head
 She thinks she's Edith Head now
 
 She's got her ear to the walls and she's tappin' the calls
 If you've got a secret boy, forget about it, 'cause she's a
 
 Hotel Detective
 My little
 Hotel Detective
 Yeah she's a
 Hotel Detective
 Why don't you check her out
 
 Well the bellhop is funky
 The dumbwaiter's a monkey
 If there's a knock at the door, boy, forget about it, 'cause she's a
 
 Hotel Detective
 My little
 Hotel Detective
 Yeah
 Hotel Detective
 Cone on and check her out
 
 She says she likes my face
 She says she owns the place
 Forget about it, 'cause she's a
 
 Hotel Detective
 My little
 Hotel Detective
 Come on her
 Hotel Detective
 Why don't you check her out
 
 Hotel Detective
 Come on and swing with me
 Hotel Detective
 From the top of a tree
 Hotel Detective
 And make me feel like a bee
 Hotel Detective
 That's where I want to know you
 
 What do you think--what do you make out of that recording?
 I don't know, Gloria, I just--
 
 Some kind of singing. They sound like all kinds of people, right?
 Yeah.
 
 And then it says "Another child is born in India every time you call this number," right?
 Yeah, right.
 
 Does that make any sense to you?
 No, it doesn't make no sense to me.
 
 And the guy that spoke--I don't know who he is.
 Yeah.
 
 But that--it doesn't sound like no answering machine, right?
 No, it ain't an answering machine because they're not saying anything, they're just--
 
 But what does he get--how does he make money on this? Whatever he's advertising in the paper, that's the part that don't make no sense.
 Oh, he's advertising this in the paper you saw it.
 
 In the Village Voice, yeah. They got--that's where the Kiss Clinic, but they give you another number if you wanna join it. And I got "Intellectuals meet with other intellectuals."
 Yeah.
 
 "Speak another language."
 Yeah. Oh.
 
 They meet at La Mai--La Maisonette restaurant. They give you the price. Then they give you another number to call if you're interested. This guy, all you get is this here recording, but I don't see how he makes money.
 Yeah, yeah.
 
 You know what I'm saying? It's just--they got the craziest things in that paper.
 Yeah.
 
 They come over with all--they got the craziest things. But this one here-- "There Must Be Giants," it's called. And it says, "Call machine," and they got the phone number.
 Yeah.
 
 But what kind of money does he make? It don't make no sense.
 Well, he don't make any money, right?
 No.
 
 But, then--then he's a nut, right? Do you see--do you see any sense to that? "There May Be Giants?" That re--that recording I have on. The new one. Did you hear it? I changed it. I took off the intellectuals. I put on There May Be Giants.
 What?
 
 Who's They May Be Giants?
 What are you talking about?
 
 That's what's on my--the phone, There May Be--argh, well I can't explain it. 'Cause I don't know what it is. Look in the paper, don't blame me if the guy's a nut. 
 
 200 SBemails
 Exhausting just to think about
 
 How can we face 200 SBemails?
 The thought of all those SBemails makes me weak
 
 Draw the curtain look you're only sleeping
 Or is this only what the other you is dreaming
 Either way hard to take
 Ashen features unmistakably your own
 Familiar posture recast in skin and bone
 Person from today here is you in 2082
 
 Remove your helmet
 First equalize the pressure
 No but first take readings to be sure
 The atmosphere is safe yes it's safe
 As the ancient one cranes his neck to look
 You see his hand's been replaced with a hook
 But it's clear you're very much alive It's 2105
 
 No it's 2240
 No it's 3415
 How can you still be living
 What does this mean
 
 You must honor and respect the older fellow
 Even as you suffocate him with his pillow
 Though you're strong he was wise
 There is much you can learn from the sage
 And though you leave and travel back to your own age
 You will meet again you two in 2082
 
 What was the look he gave intended to convey
 Was there something else he was trying to say
 It will all be revealed to you in 2082
 
 The urge to take you grows more strong
 For time had made me wait too long
 Each watch I smash apart, just adding to my power
 Each watch I smash apart, just bringing near the hour
 
 Of 25 o'clock, that's when you're going to be mine
 25 o'clock, we'll be together 'til the end of time
 At 25 o'clock
 
 The ticking seconds hear them call
 My spell of hours will make you fall
 Each timer that I break will halt the flowing sands
 Each timer that I break will put you in my hands
 
 At 25 o'clock, that's when you're going to be mine
 25 o'clock, we'll be together 'til the end of time
 At 25 o'clock
 
 Each watch I smash apart just adding to my power
 Each watch I smash apart just bringing near the hour
 
 Of 25 o'clock, that's when you're going to be mine
 25 o'clock, we'll be together 'til the end of time
 Of 25 o'clock, that's when you're going to be mine
 25 o'clock, we'll be together 'til the end of time
 
 'Til the end of time
 'Til the end
 'Til the end of time
 
 32 footsteps leading to the room where the paint doesn't want to dry
 32 footsteps running down the road where the dirt reaches the sky
 32 feathers in my brand-new Indian headdress
 32 new moons shining in 32 skies
 What's the reason, why'd she go
 Where's my baby, I don't know
 32 footsteps, counted them myself, 32 footsteps
 
 Bing bang bingalong, cing cang cingalong, ding dang dingalong day
 Fing fang fingalong, Ging gang gingalong, hing hang hingalong hay
 Jing jang jingalong, king kang kingalong, ling lang lingalong lay
 Ming mang mingalong, ning nang ningalong, ping pang pingalong pay
 
 What's the reason, why'd she go
 Where's my baby, I don't know
 32 footsteps, counted them myself, 32 footsteps
 
 32 lies my ears never saw when the floorboards gave way
 32 walls come tumbling down and the night turns to day
 32 infantrymen running in place
 32 boxcars, all of them have your face
 
 What's the reason, why'd she leave
 Don't you know we're on the eve of
 32 footsteps, counted them myself, 32 footsteps

 Throw away the thing that tells you
 Not to throw the thing away
 You'll forget to rue the day
 You went ahead and threw the thing away
 
 Nine secret steps
 To the key to the door that you'll
 Throw in the well and let go
 Of all your thwarted dreams
 And visions of success
 
 Amputate the thought that says
 You shouldn't ever amputate a thought
 You'll be overwrought until
 You go ahead and amputate the thought
 
 Nine secret steps
 To unlock the potential
 To forgo the knowledge
 Of what can be attained as long
 As nothing's ever gained
 
 I can't tell you what's in secret step five
 You will know when you're no longer alive
 
 Inhume your gloom within a tomb
 Confine your mind behind a line
 There's only doom outside your room
 Confine your mind behind a line
 
 Nine secret steps
 To the key to the door that you'll
 Throw in the well and let go
 Of all your thwarted dreams
 Let go of all your thwarted dreams
 Let go of all your thwarted dreams
 Of all your thwarted dreams
 
 I'm sitting on the curb
 By the empty parking lot
 Of the store where they let me play the organ
 I'm waiting for my ride
 But I want to wait inside
 Of the store where they let me play the organ
 
 But I'm thinking of a wooden chair
 In a room at the top of a stair
 And I'm looking down the stairwell
 At the vanishing dot
 On the map of the spot
 Let me take you there
 The dotted line
 Surrounding the mind
 Of a self called nowhere
 It's a thing named "it"
 In a bottomless pit
 You can't see it there
 The sunken head
 That lies in the bed
 Of a self called nowhere
 
 Standing in my yard
 Where they tore down the garage
 To make room for the torn down garage
 I'm looking for my car
 But I must have sold my car
 When I needed to buy an electric organ
 
 But I'm thinking of a wooden chair
 In a room at the top of a stair
 And I'm looking down the stairwell
 At the vanishing dot
 On the map of the spot
 Let me take you there
 The dotted line
 Surrounding the mind
 Of a self called nowhere
 It's a thing named "it"
 In a bottomless pit
 You can't see it there
 The sunken head
 That lies in the bed
 Of a self called nowhere
 
 Nowhere
 
 The vanishing dot
 On the map of the spot
 Let me take you there
 The dotted line
 Surrounding the mind
 Of a self called nowhere
 It's a thing named "it"
 In a bottomless pit
 You can't see it there
 The sunken head
 That lies in the bed
 Of a self called
 
 What's behind the door
 Behind the pile of furniture?
 
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 
 Reach inside the wall and feel around
 I think there's something there
 
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 
 Who's that hiding underneath the blanket?
 Pull it off and see
 
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 
 Don't you think it's time
 That we remove these bandages?
 
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 
 What's this button do?
 I wonder what's inside this ticking
 Package that's addressed to me?
 How are sausages made
 And what am I made of?
 
 I'm gonna find out now
 
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 
 I'm gonna find out now
 
 How's it going, baby?
 Tell me, is there something on your mind?
 
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 
 Why'd you turn away?
 Turn your head around so I can see
 
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 
 Why'd you hesitate?
 What was the thing you were about to say?
 
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 
 Is there something else
 That you haven't been telling me?
 
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 
 Is there any truth to the story
 That I heard from this guy
 That if you peel apart a golf ball
 That deep inside
 They put some alien blood?
 I'm gonna find out now
 
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 Aaa!
 
 I'm gonna find out now
 
 What's this button do?
 I wonder what's inside this ticking
 Package that's addressed to me?

 You might be thinking that you're free
 You might be sailing 'cross the sea
 You might be staring at the stars,
 But you'll be thinking
 About me. 
 Me
 
 I was born in a lighthouse, my mother was the sea
 I crawled to school each morning, when it occurred to me
 That life's just a mood ring we're not allowed to see
 And this is what it said to me
 
 My room is comfortably small
 With rubber lining the walls
 And there's someone always calling my name
 He calls when I'm alone
 And he calls when I'm not home
 And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
 I'm insane
 I'm insane
 I'm insane
 I'm insane
 
 Now listen all you swingers, don't you try to tag along
 I know monkey see, but monkey's dead, for you it would be wrong
 Put a dime in my jukebox, you'll only hear this song
 And it won't be fun for long
 
 Because my room is comfortably small
 With rubber lining the walls
 And there's someone always calling my name
 He calls when I'm alone
 And he calls when I'm not home
 And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
 I'm insane
 I'm insane
 I'm insane
 I'm insane
 
 Thank you
 Thank you
 
 My room is comfortably small
 With rubber lining the walls
 And there's someone always calling my name
 He calls when I'm alone
 And he calls when I'm not home
 And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain

 I'm insane
 I'm insane
 I'm insane
 
 It's just a full day's drive away
 It's just a full day's drive away
 It's just a full day's drive away
 It's just a full day's drive away
 
 We can't fly like birds in the air
 We could walk but we'd never get there
 
 It's just a full day's drive away
 It's just a full day's drive away
 It's just a full day's drive away
 It's just a full day's drive away
 
 Big hand's on 120
 Little hand's on E
 
 Hey NyQuil driver
 It's NyQuil driving time
 Hey NyQuil driver
 Get outta my lane
 Get outta my way
 
 It's just a full day's drive away
 It's just a full day's drive away
 It's just a full day's drive away
 It's just a full day's drive away
 
 Hey NyQuil driver

 It's just a full day's drive away
 
 This song is dedicated to all you modern-day troubadours out there
 And I think I know who you are
 
 I got to get a job
 Got to get some pay
 My son's gotta go to art school
 He's leaving in three days
 And the TV's in Esperanto
 You know that that's a bitch
 But alienation's for the rich
 And I'm feeling poorer every day
 Hey hey hey
 
 Well I ain't feeling happy
 About the state of things in my life
 But I'm working to make it better
 With a six of Miller High Life
 Just drinking and a-driving
 Making sure my dues get paid
 Because alienation's for the rich
 And I'm feeling poorer every day
 Hey hey hey
 
 Well I ain't feeling happy
 About the state of things in my life

 Once upon a time they sent a rocket to the moon
 With scientific instruments to test conditions there
 But just before they closed the door, one scientist expelled a germ
 That accidentally found its way aboard and stowed away
 For three years it remained undetected on the moon
 It was the only living creature there:
 "I'm all alone
 I'm all alone
 Behold the mystery that is me"
 
 Then one day the scientists recovered all their gear
 Excited by the prospect of unearthly things inside
 They found, to their astonishment, a living thing within
 It seemed to bear good tidings from somewhere in outer space:
 "You're not alone
 You're not alone
 Behold the mystery that is me"
 
 Soon they figured out the heinous error they had made
 And now the earthly germ had something else it seemed to say:
 "We're all alone
 We're all alone
 Behold the mystery
 Behold the mystery"
 
 We're gettin' metal with it 
 We're all MacGyver on it 
 It's not provisional and highly temporary 
 It's the unbroken synapses acting out and talking scary 
 They'd better listen up and fast 'cause now I'm metal on it 
 Grab your keys, grab your hat, 
 Grab your coat, tell your mom 
 You won't be home 'cause now 
 We're goin' metal on it 
 
 Now we're metal with it 
 We're all MacGyver on it 
 Things are different and kinda confrontational 
 Man, if you can't see, I guess you must be goin' blind 
 There's nothing left but the smoke that's comin' off the mind 
 
 They can run, they can hide 
 We will never be denied 
 They start the party quick 
 By goin' metal on it 
 
 We're gettin' metal with it 
 We're all MacGyver on it 
 It's not provisional and never temporary 
 It's the unbroken synapses acting out and talking scary 
 We're all MacGyver on it.
 
 Begin again, begin again
 Wake up the lazy boyfriends
 Begin again, begin again
 We can start at the end
 
 Push your hands in your pockets, spaced out and sleepless
 Put yourself on the docket, get ready to go
 Got a brand-new day planner still snug in the wrapper
 And the weekly to-do list as white as the snow
 
 So who's good for nothing?
 After you've run through your personal time
 You've still got some Wite-Out
 Enough to erase all the previous line
 
 Did you say out loud that you think you've lost your edge?
 Man, you never lost your edge
 All the lazy boyfriends are preparing to change
 They're standing in the kitchen and preparing to change
 All the lazy boyfriends are preparing to change
 
 This American splendor spreads out before you
 From basements to attics, garages to sheds
 Who needs a vacation? Who needs a direction?
 Who needs motivation when you live in your head?
 
 So who's good for nothing?
 So hard to finish, there's nothing to force
 You've still got some Wite-Out
 And all of the girlfriends' buyer's remorse
 
 Did you say out loud that you think you've lost your edge?
 Man, you never lost your edge
 All the lazy boyfriends are preparing to change
 They're staring at the ceiling and preparing to change
 All the lazy boyfriends are preparing
 
 I use my outside voice because I have no choice
 The barn that I was raised in was constructed out of noise
 And now I'm all torn up because my buttercup
 Up and gone and left me
 Said she finally had enough
 Left me here to ruminate on all she can't admit
 And all she can't explain
 
 All time what, I never thought, I never thought
 All time what, things break apart, things break apart
 
 Man, she pulled out the rug from her doodlebug
 Rolling down the highway
 Not a worry in her mind
 Here's a flash card where someone's written stultify
 I take it as a sign
 It's hard to redefine
 Same old sad soliloquy
 They handed me a broom
 The cast has left the room
 
 All time what, stumble about wrapped in a shroud
 All time what, partly submerged playing a dirge
 
 Complete completely completelier
 Defeat defeated defeatlier
 Complete completely completelier
 Defeat defeated defeatlier
 
 All time what, I never thought, I never thought
 All time what, things break apart, things break apart

 Am I awake? 
 
 What time is it? 
 
 When I get through this day
 Can someone tell me how
 And how much longer now
 Am I awake? 
 
 The coffee's cold, did I forget to drink it yet
 Did I forget?
 My clothes are wet I don't remember drinking it 
 
 When I get through this part
 Will the next one be the same
 Will I be wondering
 If I'm awake? 
 
 These are not the clothes I had on when I went to bed
 And something else besides my hair is growing from my head
 And when I close my eyes it looks the same as when I open them again 
 
 Am I awake? 
 
 What time is it? 
 
 Is it that time again?
 Wasn't it already then?
 So does it have to be
 The time it was again 
 
 When I get through this day
 Can't someone tell me how
 And how much longer now
 Am I awake?
 Am I awake? 
 
 When I get through this day
 Can someone tell me how
 And how much longer now
 Am I awake? 
 
 When I get through this day
 Can someone tell me how
 And how much longer now
 Am I awake?
 
 Hey!
 Hats off to the things you don't say
 Why?
 So what's up with the side-eye?
 
 Spent so long trying to get along
 Trying to please you
 Trying to tease out all the details
 From the sad straight notions that just all seem wrong
 I defy interpretation
 I am not participating in it
 
 Fine!
 Pick on someone else your own size
 Fine!
 Go prey on some stranger passing by
 
 Hey!
 Hats off to the things you don't say
 Why?
 So what's up with the side-eye?
 
 My sad mind searching overtime
 For a reason
 You suspiciously incorporate some far-fetched fiction you find so sublime
 But it's too late to reject and it's an insult to the fact checkers
 
 Make a hole with a gun perpendicular
 To the name of this town in a desk-top globe
 Exit wound in a foreign nation
 Showing the home of the one this was written for
 My apartment looks upside down from there
 Water spirals the wrong way out the sink
 And her voice is a backwards record
 It's like a whirlpool and it never ends
 
 Ana Ng and I are getting old
 And we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence
 Listen Ana hear my words
 They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you
 
 All alone at the sixty-four World's Fair
 Eighty dolls singing small world after all
 Who was at the Dupont Pavilion?
 Why was the bench still warm? Who had been there?
 Or the time when the storm tangled up the wire
 To the horn on the pole at the bus depot
 And in the back of the edge of hearing
 These are the words the voice was repeating
 
 Ana Ng and I are getting old
 And we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence
 Listen Ana hear my words
 They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you
 
 When I was driving once I saw this painted on a bridge,
 I don't want the world, I just want your half
 
 They don't need me here, and I know you're there 
 Where the world goes by like the humid air 
 And it sticks like a broken record
 Everything sticks like a broken record
 Everything sticks until it goes away 
 And the truth is, we don't know anything 
 
 Ana Ng and I are getting old
 And we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence
 Listen Ana hear my words
 They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you
 
 Ana Ng and I are getting old
 And we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence
 Listen Ana hear my words
 They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you
 
 Ana Ng and I are getting old
 And we still haven't walked in the glow of each others majestic presence
 Listen Ana hear my words
 They're the ones you would think I would say if there was a me for you
 
 I'm asleep but she's talking to me
 She's walking 'round wearing all of my clothes
 As she runs out of things to say
 And grabs my coat to walk away
 
 "How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
 "How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
 I want another first kiss like this
 How 'bout another first kiss?
 
 Other people were too sentimental
 And always worrying about their hair
 Got tired of wasting all of my time
 Now I'm not worrying at all
 
 "How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
 "How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
 I want another first kiss like this
 How 'bout another first kiss?
 
 I could tell you "We belong together."
 And I could tell you "You belong with me."
 But we've run out of things to say
 And we'll be happy anyway so
 
 "How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
 "How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
 I want another first kiss like this
 How 'bout another first kiss?
 
 "How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
 "How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
 I want another first kiss like this
 How 'bout another first kiss?
 
 Year after year
 Though every dream of a pony would end in tears
 The cake was lit and as you blew the candles out
 Your heart refilled
 And every year
 Your dream was killed
 
 It may take an ocean of whiskey and time
 To wash all of the letdown out of your mind
 And this may not be the thing you requested but I
 Am the answer to all your prayers
 
 All this time interested agents have been eavesdropping upstairs
 When will you recognize that I am the answer to all your prayers?
 
 You ordered well
 They brought you medium rare
 You were promised fair
 And in response a clap of thunder broke the air
 The weather changed
 The sky went black
 And then it rained
 
 It may take an ocean of whiskey and time
 To wash all of the letdown out of your mind
 And this may not be the item you selected but I
 Am the answer to all your prayers
 
 All this time the surveillance machine has been all up in your affairs
 When will you realize that I am the answer to all your prayers?
 
 It might seem like a thankless existence
 But don't lose hope just yet
 You'll be remembered for your persistence
 And this is the thanks you get
 
 You wanted tall
 I came in under 5'4
 Then you asked for dark
 I tend to sunburn a lot
 As for handsome, well
 Can't help you there
 So make of it what you will
 
 It may take an ocean of whiskey and time
 To wash all of the letdown out of your mind
 And I may not be the one you expected but I
 Am the answer to all your prayers
 
 All this time interested agents have been eavesdropping upstairs
 When will you get that I am the answer to all your prayers?
 All this time the surveillance machine has been all up in your affairs
 It should be clear to you by now that I am the final answer to all your prayers
 
 There's an ant crawling up your back in the nighttime
 There's an ant crawling up your back in the nighttime
 But you think that's okay while you're sleeping
 
 That ant crawled in your head in the nighttime
 That ant crawled in your head in the nighttime
 But you think that's okay while you're sleeping
 
 Someday, that ant, he will grow up to be President
 Someday, that ant, he will grow up to be President
 But you think that's okay while you're sleeping
 
 The President calls your name in the nighttime
 The President calls your name in the nighttime
 And that will spoil your dreams, while you're sleeping.
 
 The men ransack your house in the nighttime
 The men ransack your house in the nighttime
 As the ant crawls up your back while you're sleeping
 
 I live up in apartment four
 I'm on the very next floor
 The number's right on the door
 
 If you ever get bored
 Come knock on my door
 The one with the four
 
 I live up in apartment number four
 Where the sound of the drum comes from
 Just follow the sound
 That's where the four is found
 
 You don't know me
 But I remember when you
 Moved into flat number two
 That was the day that I knew
 
 That I was not the only one
 Who might like the drum
 That was shaking the floor
 Of apartment four
 
 Come on up to apartment number four
 Where the noise of the drum comes from
 Just follow the sound
 That's where the four is found
 
 Please allow me to introduce myself, I'm the Orange Peel
 You don't remember but I was once part of your orange
 
 I'm the peel that you left on the floor
 You took the good part and walked out the door
 And I hate you for that
 I hate you for that
 I'm the Orange Peel
 
 When the flood waters reach where I lay
 French Broad River will float me away
 And I hate you for that
 I hate you for that
 I'm the Orange Peel
 I'm the Orange Peel
 I'm the Orange Peel
 
 David Bowie came to town
 Flying overhead
 "Don't you dig my chops?" he cried
 This is what they said 
 
 Au contraire, Dave
 Quite the opposite, in fact
 As it happens, au contraire
 Au contraire, mon frare 
 
 Franklin Delano Roosevelt
 Knew not what to do
 "This tie clashes with my hat," he cried
 "Don't you think that's true?" 
 
 Au contraire, Delano
 Hate to rain on your parade
 I need to tell you au contraire
 Au contraire, mon frare 
 
 Jodie Foster held two pair
 Bach had three of a kind
 Gandhi said, "With my full house,
 I will blow your mind!" 
 
 Au contraire, Mahatma
 Hate to contradict you, but
 As it happens, au contraire
 Au contraire, yes au contraire 
 
 And au contraire, you square
 Wash that notion from your hair
 If you're still there, I must declare
 That au contraire, mon tras
 Bon frae 
 
 Right on!
 
 Stubb's!  
 Stubb's!  
 Driving a wedge in my mind 
 Stubb's!  
 Stubb's!  
 Cutting off my skull 
 
 What're we gonna do with these bones? 
 What're we gonna do with these bones? 
 Stubb's!  
 Stubb's!  
 Bring 'em to Stubb's 
 
 JF: "Ladies and gentlemen, we're They Might Be Giants of Brooklyn, New York. It's a stone cold gas to be here at Stubb's tonight. On the drums, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Marty Beller from New York City. On the superbass, direct from New York City, it's Mr. Daniel Weinkauf. Just back from his vacation in New York City, from New York City on the electric guitar, Mr. Dan Miller. My name's John. He's John. We're from New York City,  thanks for coming out." 
 
 Stubb's!  
 Stubb's!  
 Removing the back of my skull 
 
 Stubb's!  
 Stubb's!  
 Cutting a notch in my mind 
 
 What're we gonna do with these bones? 
 What're we gonna do with these bones? 
 Stubb's!  
 Stubb's!  
 Bring 'em to Stubb's 
 
 "Thank you very much."
 
 Davy, Davy Crockett
 Traveling through outer space
 
 Reborn in the stratosphere and Saturn-bound
 Flying fast and miles off the ground
 Jumped from the spaceship just to look around
 And shot off his gun without making a sound
 
 Davy, Davy Crockett
 King of this brand new place
 Davy, Davy Crockett
 Traveling through outer space
 
 Off went his rocket at the speed of light
 Flying so fast there was no day or night
 Messing around with the fabric of time
 He knows who's guilty 'fore there's even a crime
 
 Davy, Davy Crockett
 The buckskin astronaut
 Davy, Davy Crockett
 There's more than we were taught
 
 Hiding in the cargo was a robot drone
 Programmed to destroy Davy's spaceship home
 Davy switched out his brains, now the drone's a dog clone
 Named him Copernicus and threw him a bone
 
 Davy, Davy Crockett
 King of this brand new place
 Davy, Davy Crockett
 Traveling through outer space
 
 Davy, Davy Crockett
 King of this brand new place
 Davy, Davy Crockett
 Traveling through outer space
 
 Bangs
 Above your eyes your hair hangs
 Blow my mind your royal flyness I dig your bangs
 
 Bangs
 To drape across your forehead
 To swing concordant angles as you incline your head
 
 Once with a girl I fell in love sometime ago now she had
 
 Bangs
 Are that on which the world hangs
 I'm only holding your hand so I can look at your bangs
 
 Bangs
 Are like a pocket T-shirt
 As casual as that while fully intentional
 
 And in case you think I'm here cause I like making chit chat
 Just remember what I said the money's under your hat
 
 Bangs
 Are that on which the world hangs
 I'm only holding your hand so I can look at your bangs
 
 Bangs
 Above your eyes your hair hangs
 Blow my mind your royal flyness I dig your bangs
 
 Bangs
 To drape across your forehead
 To swing concordant angles as you incline your head
 
 And although I like you anyway, check out your haircut
 A proscenium to stage a face that needs no makeup
 
 Bangs
 Are that on which the world hangs
 I'm only holding your hand so I can look at your bangs
 I'm only holding your hand so I can look at your bangs
 
 A bear with a honey pot stuck on its head
 A large green hippo with blinking eyes
 Some tiny tiny people swinging tiny tiny lanterns
 On the Main Street Electrical Parade
 
 He says he knows me
 But I don't know that guy
 He's waving at me
 But he looks kind of mad
 
 Some crazy bastard wants to hit me
 He's waving me over so he can hit me
 But I don't know that guy
 But I'm not going over there
 Some crazy bastard wants to hit me
 
 How have we come to this pass?
 How can I get to my car?
 Climb in, turn the ignition
 Pull onto the highway
 Where I am free
 
 Some crazy bastard wants to hit me
 He's waving me over so he can hit me
 And who the hell is he?
 I can't believe this is happening
 That crazy bastard wants to hit me
 
 Crowd chants "people people people", and "ape ape ape" at the commands of the johns.
 
 Here's hoping you don't 
 Become a robot 
 Clang, clang, whoops, too late
 Here's hoping you don't 
 Become a robot 
 Clang, clang, whoops, too late
 
 Let's stick together 'cause we're number 8
 Let's stick to numbers 'cause we're great
 
 Here's hoping you don't 
 Become a robot 
 Clang, clang, whoops, too late
 
 Hey!
 Wait!
 
 Here's hoping you don't 
 Harbor a deathwish 
 Help, help, help yourself
 Here's hoping you don't 
 Harbor a deathwish 
 Help, help, help yourself
 
 Hip, hip, horrific are the words we sing
 Hip, hip, horrific is our thing
 
 Here's hoping you don't 
 Become a robot 
 Help, help, help, help
 Help, help, help
 
 The day is done
 The sun is down
 The curtains have been drawn
 And darkness has descended over everything in town
 The covers have been turned and I've got my pajamas on
 I've had my fun
 I've stretched and yawned and all is said and done
 I'm going to bed
 Bed bed bed bed bed
 
 I've done so many things today
 There's nothing left to do
 I ate three meals, I rode my bike, I hung out with my friends
 I did my chores, I watched TV, I practiced the guitar
 I brushed my teeth, I read my book, and then I sat around
 I'm going to bed
 Bed bed bed bed bed
 
 Moo 
 
 Oh it's pointless staying up for even twenty seconds more
 When everything has happened and there's nothing else in store
 The thing is now to lay my head down, close my eyes, and snore
 And so to bed directly I go
 
 Bed
 Bed bed bed bed bed
 
 I'm going to bed
 Bed 
 
 Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying
 Of the bee of the bird of the moth
 You can't walk, you can't ramble 'cause you're gonna have to scramble
 From the bee of the bird of the moth
 
 Catbug is a cat, but he's got bugness in his veins
 Manhouse lives within himself with thoughtful human brains
 Neither one is equal to the challenge of the freak we'll call
 The bee of the bird of the moth
 
 Now the moth defeats the mouse and man
 It's messing with the plan, it can't be believed
 'Cause it's just a hummingbird moth
 Who's acting like a bird that thinks it's a bee
 
 Got a brand new shipment of electrical equipment
 It's addressed to the bottom of the sea
 Send a tangerine-colored nuclear submarine
 With a sticker that says 'STP'
 
 Windshield wiper washer fluid spraying in the air
 Head lice under hats lie in the headlights everywhere
 Subatomic waves to the underwater caves
 Of the bee of the bird of the moth
 
 And the moth defeats the mouse and man
 It's messing with the plan, it can't be believed
 'Cause it's just a hummingbird moth
 Who's acting like a bird that thinks it's a bee
 
 Is it us or it that's messed up?
 
 Everyone's deforming in the presence of the swarming
 Of the bee of the bird of the moth
 Protozoa, snakes, and horses have enlisted in the forces
 Of the bee of the bird of the moth
 All are irresistibly directed by the section of a hypnotizing tractor beam presenting a prediction
 Of the sleep of reason corporation in association
 With the bee of the bird of the moth
 
 All my friends are beneath the planet of the apes
 All my friends are
 All my friends are
 All my friends are beneath the planet of the apes
 And when I get there
 I'll find my friends there
 Deep inside the ground
 Underneath the town
 Where the apes live
 Where the apes live
 You can't walk around
 Because it is in town
 All my friends are
 All my friends are
 Beneath the planet
 Of the apes
 
 I'm your only friend
 I'm not your only friend
 But I'm a little glowing friend
 But really I'm not actually your friend
 But I am
 
 Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
 Who watches over you
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul
 Not to put too fine a point on it
 Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul
 
 I have a secret to tell
 From my electrical well
 It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
 So the room must listen to me
 Filibuster vigilantly
 My name is blue canary one note spelled l-I-t-e
 My story's infinite
 Like the Longines Symphonette it doesn't rest
 
 Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
 Who watches over you
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul
 Not to put too fine a point on it
 Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul
 
 I'm your only friend
 I'm not your only friend
 But I'm a little glowing friend
 But really I'm not actually your friend
 But I am
 
 There's a picture opposite me
 Of my primitive ancestry
 Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
 Though I respect that a lot
 I'd be fired if that were my job
 After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts
 Bluebird of friendliness
 Like guardian angels its always near
 
 Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
 Who watches over you
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul
 Not to put too fine a point on it
 Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul
 
 (And while you're at it
 Keep the nightlight on inside the
 Birdhouse in your soul)
 
 Not to put too fine a point on it
 Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul
 
 Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch 
 Who watches over you 
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul 
 
 Not to put too fine a point on it
 Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul
 
 Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch 
 Who watches over you 
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul 
 
 Not to put too fine a point on it
 Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
 Make a little birdhouse in your soul
 
 Birds fly into my windshield
 Thoughts fall from my thoughts
 This good luck charm hanging off my arm
 Was left here by the police
 
 Words fall out of my pockets
 And cats dance under my feet
 This colorful spell under which I live
 Protects me from all I write
 
 And the microscope reveals the scope
 Of my very best intentions 
 Yes, the tiny light shines twice as bright
 On the only nice part of me
 
 Birds fly into my windshield
 Thoughts fall from my thoughts
 This good luck charm hanging off my arm
 Was left here by the police
 
 And the microscope reveals the scope
 Of my very best intentions 
 Oh yes the tiny light shines twice as bright
 On the only nice part of me
 
 Black ops 
 Black ops
 A holiday for secret cops 
 Black ops 
 Black ops 
 Dropping presents from the helicopter
 
 It's been a long year 
 We've been so far from home 
 Too many people here
 Here come the drones 
 We take the best of it 
 And make a mess of it 
 Ripping up some lawn 
 And then we're gone
 
 Black sites Black sites 
 A thousand miles from day or night 
 Black sites Black sites 
 The story will remain unwritten
 
 Before we make you gone 
 You'd best be running on 
 Stick to the music, child Don't get us riled 
 Hey, there's a spot we missed I see a 
 Communist 
 And there's another one 
 And his dumb son
 
 Black ops 
 Black ops 
 Little vials filled with knock-out drops 
 Black ops Black ops 
 Maybe leave you in your old gym locker
 
 A thousand miles from day or night  
 
 A story told before rewriting 
 There's a passport here 
 But it could disappear 
 Tarmac to landing pad 
 Don't look so sad We fly to 
 Amsterdam And in a little bit 
 We'll sing our special song And this is it
 
 He'll be standing when the music stops 
 
 We're not worrying about the optics
 
 The Bloodmobile
 The Bloodmobile
 A delivery service inside us
 
 We begin in the heart's right ventricle
 And travel to the lungs
 Red blood cells get oxygen
 To take back to the heart
 Then from the left side of the heart
 And out to every cell
 Delivered by the Bloodmobile
 
 The food that's been digested
 Is waiting at the dock
 To be taken to the tissues
 In the body's grocery truck
 So from the small intestine
 It's carried everywhere
 Delivered by the Bloodmobile
 
 The Bloodmobile
 The Bloodmobile
 A delivery service inside us
 
 The white blood cells are soldiers
 That fight infectious germs
 They make the antibodies
 Their weapons in the fight
 The army is transported
 Wherever they must go
 Delivered by the Bloodmobile
 
 We need to send a message
 To tell a limb to grow
 Or speed the heart or regulate
 Your hunger or your sleep
 The hormones are the message
 They're sent from many glands
 The messenger's the Bloodmobile
 
 Somebody's got to haul out the trash
 To the liver and the kidneys
 It's not a pretty job
 Carbon dioxide gets carried
 To the lungs to be exhaled
 And the garbage truck is the Bloodmobile
 
 The Bloodmobile
 The Bloodmobile
 A delivery service inside us
 To carry oxygen, nutrients, things that fight infections
 Do the trash collection and deliver the mail
 And we're all 
 Delivered by the Bloodmobile
 
 Daddy'll sing bass
 Daddy'll sing bass
 Daddy'll sing bass
 Daddy'll sing bass
 
 I took my boat for a car
 I took that car for a ride
 I was trying to get somewhere
 But now I'm following the traces of your fingernails
 That run along the windshield on the boat of car
 
 Daddy'll sing bass
 
 Traces of your fingernails that run along the windshield
 On the boat of car
 On the boat of car
 On the boat of car
 On the boat of car
 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 I don't know
 Can you repeat the question?
 
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big
 
 Life is unfair, so I just stare at the stain on the wall where
 The TV'd been, but ever since we've moved in it's been empty
 
 Why I, why I'm in this room 
 There is no point explaining
 
 You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big
 
 Life is a test, and I confess
 I like this mess I've made so far
 Grade on a curve and you'll observe
 I'm right below the horizon
 
 Yes, no, maybe, I don't know
 Can you repeat the question?
 
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big
 
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now
 You're not the boss of me now, and you're not so big
 
 Life is unfair
 
 Wake up
 Put on my makeup
 And pick the rake up
 And rake my hair
 
 And I think, maybe
 But I don't know
 But I'm starting to feel like
 I got a brain problem
 Situation on my hands

 I got a brain problem
 Situation on my hands
 
 On my hands
 I'm looking down
 And I can see what I got
 On my hands
 Is a brain problem situation
 
 Twenty-nine inches
 Of snow on the top
 Of the situation on the brain
 And the scraper I buried
 Somewhere in the 
 Springtime will emerge
 
 And I think, maybe
 But I don't know
 But I'm starting to feel like
 I got a brain problem
 Situation on my hands
 
 I think, maybe
 But I don't know
 But I'm starting to feel like
 I got a brain problem
 Situation in the bag
 
 In the bag, in the paper bag
 Is the source of the call
 It was traced
 To the paper bag
 Yes, the call has been traced
 To the bag
 
 Stand up
 And put our hand up
 And with our eyes closed
 We touch our nose
 
 And the cop tells us
 But we don't know
 But we're starting to feel like
 We got a brain problem
 Situation on our hands
 
 We think, officer
 But we don't know
 But we're starting to feel like
 We got a brain problem
 Situation on our hands
 
 On our hands
 On our hands
 
 In the drunk tank
 We're in the drunk tank
 We're in the drunk tank
 All by ourselves
 
 And I think, maybe
 But I don't know
 But I'm starting to feel like
 I got a brain problem
 Situation on my hands
 
 I think, maybe
 But I don't know
 But I'm starting to feel like

 You said something before you left
 Something I was not to forget
 
 Then
 Is when I maybe should have wrote it down
 But when I looked around to find a pen
 And then I tried to think of what you said
 
 We broke in two
 Busted through
 Broke in two
 
 I would go back to the top of the day from scratch
 If I thought that this thing could be fixed
 Though sadly I'd do exactly the same thing as when
 
 We broke in two
 Busted through
 Broke in two
 
 You said "I'm gonna run you down"
 I heard "I'm an orangutan"

 By the time you get this note
 We'll no longer be alive
 We'll have all gone up in smoke
 There'll be no way to reply
 You'll be wondering about the world that vanished long ago
 And the words that reach you now
 That were buried underground
 
 Greetings to everyone in 1937
 It seems that you were never aware that we were here
 You're probably too busy rejoicing in the present
 To stop and be reminded of the dark and troubled past
 
 By the time you get this note
 We'll no longer be alive
 But our skulls are smiling still
 At the thought of things to come
 We can confidently know that you'll enjoy a better world
 When the evils that we faced
 Will at last be laid to rest
 
 When the poisons of the Earth
 Are completely neutralized
 When the hatred and the lies
 Are forever put aside
 When the voices of dissent and contradiction all abate
 And the peaceful air is filled
 With a silent harmony
 
 We can't be certain at the moment of this writing
 But surely in the future there'll be no barking dogs
 The sound of crying babies will be thankfully forgotten
 No more will the chattering classes make a noise
 
 By the time you get this note
 A millenium from now
 We'll have all gone up in smoke
 There'll be no way to reply
 And we confidently know
 You'll enjoy a better time
 When the evils that we faced
 Will at last be laid to rest
 
 Most with cones for seeds, most with needles for leaves
 See is for conifers, my kind of trees
 Large junipers and fir, spruce, cedars and pines
 See is for conifers, more then five hundred kinds
 If you see a Christmas tree or a stack of newspapers or a 2x4 frame of a house
 It's probably made from pine trees and pine trees are conifers, that's what this song is about
 Or if you see a plant in the shape of an elephant, or in the shape of a dog
 It's probably a shrub, a conifer shrub pruned into that shape by someone
 Most with cones for seeds, most with needles for leaves
 See is for conifers, my kind of trees
 Large junipers and fir, spruce, cedars and pines
 See is for conifers, more then five hundred kinds
 
 Spoken: There are so many different kinds of conifer trees.
 This is just a few of them: Spruce,
 Hemlocks, larch, cyprus, juniper,
 Fir, Douglas fir, cedar, yew,
 Pine, the dwarf conifer,
 And the great California sequoia redwood.
 
 Most with cones for seeds, most with needles for leaves

 I was laying on the porch
 As the bus drove by
 Just talking to the dog
 About thinking to myself
 There are so many big ideas
 We could talk about
 But nothing that gets said
 Gets us out of Cabbagetown
 
 Oh, Cabbagetown
 Oh, Cabbagetown
 I will leave and I'll return
 Oh, Cabbagetown
 
 I talked to my old granddad
 As he fell into the sea
 He said time and tide are one thing
 That no one understands
 I talked to my uncle Jack
 As he tried to talk to me
 With a bottle in one hand
 And another in the other
 
 Oh, Cabbagetown
 Oh, Cabbagetown
 I will leave and I'll return
 Oh, Cabbagetown
 
 Somebody's reading your mind
 Damned if you know who it is
 They're digging through all of your files
 Stealing back your best ideas
 You cover your windows with lead
 Even keeping the pets outside
 Then you hear a moment too late this sound coming over the phone
 
 This is the spawning of the cage and aquarium
 Don't wait a moment too soon
 Used to be different, now you're the same
 Yawn as your plane goes down in flames
 This is the spawning of the cage and aquarium
 Don't wait a moment too soon
 Used to be different, now you're the same
 Yawn as your plane goes down in flames
 
 And we'll go out on the town
 Why don't you let me call you that?
 You're acting so much like my mom
 She didn't like it when I called her name
 You and her are the same
 
 When we go out, you'll know someone who's there
 You will feel someone's staring at you
 You're on my mind, as I dream of the game
 When I'm holding you
 Then I turn around to find that you were gone
 Which was exactly like my mom
 And I will go hang up my sailor suit
 Right face down on the lawn
 
 When we go out, you'll know someone is there
 You will feel someone's staring at you
 You're on my mind, as I dream of a game
 When I'm holding you
 Then I turn around to find that you were gone
 Which was exactly like my mom
 And I will go hang up my sailor suit
 Right face down on the lawn
 
 I see you moving towards the deck
 'Cause you don't trust me anymore
 I need to find someone who's nice to me
 The way that you used to be
 And then I'm gonna call her you
 'Cause she'll remind me of you
 I'm gonna dress her in the sailor suit
 That will look very cute
 
 When we go out, she'll know someone is there
 You will feel someone's staring at her
 She's on my mind, as I dream of a game
 When she's holding you
 Then she turns around to find that I am gone
 Which was exactly like my mom
 And she will go hang up her sailor suit
 Right face down on the lawn
 
 Can you find the hidden H where it's hiding?
 Is it on the ground or in the sky or part of something here?
 Does it fit somewhere inside?
 Is there somewhere it can hide?
 
 Can you find it?
 Can you find it?
 Can you find it?
 There it is.
 
 Where's the secret are? Can you see it?
 Is it in the train or on the tracks or at the station house?
 Is the are inside the tree?
 Where oh where can it be?
 
 Can you find it?
 Can you find it?
 Can you find it?
 There it is.
 
 Where is the L?
 Is it under the chair?
 Is it growing in the hair?
 Where could it be?
 We have looked everywhere
 And I'm sorry to say
 That it's part of the H, which isn't fair.
 
 Now, where are you hiding, D?
 Oh, you're never gonna find me. But my question to you is, W, where are you hiding?
 I have no idea. I've been looking everywhere.
 
 Where is the M?
 Is it invisible?
 Or is that against the rules?
 Where can it be?
 Well, it's right in front of you
 And I'll give you a clue:
 It's an upside-down W.
 
 There are letters everywhere in this picture.
 There's A B, an F, a Z, an X, a P, an O, a Y.
 There's a sideways letter Q,
 The aforementioned W.
 
 Can you find them?
 Can you find them?
 Can you find them?
 Can you find them?
 
 Can you find them?
 Can you find them?
 Can you find them?
 
 Here they are.
 
 Outnumbered a million to one
 All of the dicks in this dick town
 Can't keep Johnny down
 Men piled up in a towering mound
 None of them once has found a way
 To keep Johnny down
 
 Spending days by myself
 Remembering slights
 I'm not a monument to justice
 Plus which I don't forget a face
 
 And they can't 
 Can't keep Johnny down 
 They haven't yet built the man 
 That'll keep old Johnny down 
 
 Some dude
 Hitting golf balls on the moon
 Bathroom in his pants
 And he thinks he's better than me
 I'm pointing a finger at my own face
 They can't know what's in here
 And they can't keep Johnny down
 
 Beneath my dignity 
 To flip off the guy
 When he pulls up alongside
 To say my gas cap is unscrewed
 
 And they can't 
 Can't keep Johnny down 
 They haven't yet built the man 
 That'll keep old Johnny down 
 
 And they don't 
 Don't know what I've seen 
 They can't know what's in here 
 And they can't keep Johnny down 
 
 In the overgrowth of the underbrush
 Shone a fossil tooth which I must have dropped
 Very long ago which reminded me how
 We wound up where we are now
 
 Right through those trees I'm not insane
 That's where we came into this place
 And if you squint if you squint your brain
 I'll get my paints and I'll try to paint
 
 Canajoharie
 Canajoharie
 Where a front flipper first evolved on the day
 When a daring mudskipper dragged itself away
 Out of Canajoharie
 Canajoharie
 Call me sentimental but I want to go back
 And commemorate the place with a historical plaque
 
 It's as if a fin reaching from the swamp
 Grabbed me by my arm tried to pull me in
 But my arm was strong and the fin was an
 Inaccurately reconstructed fake
 
 It was right through those trees I'm not insane
 That's where the fin tried to drag me in
 Don't look at me look at where I'm pointing
 Close your eyes see what I see
 
 The known, the unknown, and the under-known
 Look at what she found
 Digging all around
 By the goldfish pond
 She's gonna get in trouble now
 Shaking up the bees, swinging from that tree
 Doesn't understand
 She's in trouble now
 
 It's a new year
 Careful what you pack
 There's no going back
 She's lost from the beginning
 She's the new girl
 
 She thinks she's smart; she's just curious
 She thinks she's alone
 Doesn't even know someone's watching her
 She's gonna get in trouble now
 Waving from the shore, never knew before
 Doesn't understand
 She's in trouble now
 
 It's a new year
 Careful what you pack
 There's no going back
 She's lost from the beginning
 She's the new girl
 
 Careful what you pack
 There's no going back
 She's lost from the beginning
 She's the new girl
 
 Careless Santa
 Spoiled my Christmastime
 Thoughtless Santa
 How can I forgive him?
 Been so good all year long 
 Bag of money
 Was all I asked him for
 Down my chimney it came
 My one Christmas wish
 Landed on my arm and broke it
 
 Careless Santa
 Spoiled my bankrobbing scheme
 Thoughtless Santa
 How can I forgive him?
 I laid low like we planned
 
 Bag of money
 Is all he stole for me
 Down my driveway I came
 The place was crawling with cops
 Spotted the cast on my arm and they busted me
 
 Careless Santa
 Thoughtless Santa
 
 Where did your long hair go
 Where is the girl I used to know
 How could you lose that happy glow
 Oh, Caroline no
 
 Who took that look away
 I remember how you used to say
 You'd never change, but that's not true
 Oh, Caroline you
 
 Break my heart
 I want to go and cry
 It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
 Oh, Caroline why
 
 Could I ever find in you again
 Things that made me love you so much then
 Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone
 Oh, Caroline no
 
 I see that Banksy left a Post-it note
 For Anonymous for Anonymous
 It seems the after party has been moved
 To your house to your house
 It's a special night of anticipation
 The moonbeams strong on the old band shell
 
 Celebration you're a little bit better and ready for some
 Celebration some time to get louder and not by yourself
 
 I see that someone left their cheat sheet
 By this microphone by this microphone
 I think the rock and roll girls in this world
 Want apologies want apologies
 I read this stuff but I don't believe it
 I'd change it round but I don't know how
 
 Perpetrators of invisible crimes
 Our only magistrate sits in our minds
 The audience cheers as some people attack
 The secret smile of security guards
 
 You hear the cataclysmic discharge
 Of the optimist of the optimist
 And the unlikely crowd assembled here's
 Like Hieronymus Bosch Hieronymus
 It's hard to see from this elevation
 But looking up you can set it off
 
 The few surviving samurai survey the battlefield
 Count the arms, the legs and heads and then divide by 5
 Drenched in blood they move across the screen
 Do I need to point or do you see the one I mean
 The one in back, the way he acts
 Is he reminding you of anyone we know
 Isn't he so like certain people I could name
 
 Halfway through the thirty minutes
 Halfway round the world
 Here's the story on the genocidal overlord
 In the palace with her epilettes
 Watch her little gestures as she lights her cigarette
 Look at her, you must see it too
 Is she reminding you of anyone we know
 Isn't she so like certain people I could name
 
 Disembodied and detached a voice describes the scene
 As a lizard stalks a helpless creature on TV
 Music underscores the tragedy
 Eyes with no expression watch the unsuspecting prey
 Who is it like, doesn't it strike
 You as the very image of someone we know
 Isn't it so like certain people--how could anybody miss
 The obvious and the uncanny and the clear resemblance
 Isn't it just like certain people I could name
 
 What's gonna happen to chess piece face
 There go I but for my face
 All I know could be defaced by the facts in the life of chess piece face
 
 I don't know where he lives
 Or if he knows to sail
 Or if little schemes like this one ever cross his trail
 But I don't believe he's dreaming
 Or if he cares to know
 So I shudder in my lampshade
 
 So, what's gonna happen to chess piece face
 There I go but for my face
 All I know could be defaced by the facts in the life of chess piece face
 Chess piece face
 Chess piece face
 Chess piece face
 
 Never took a class before in 
 Self defense 
 Never looked at you before with 
 Common sense
 
 Gird myself for a short sharp shock 
 Trace myself in sidewalk chalk
 I'll shut my mouth, you do the talking 
 
 You're so proud of your circular karate chop 
 Afternoons in the mirror doing pop and lock 
 From the junk shop to the truck stop to the big big top
 
 Detention hall, name on the wall and 
 Locker dent 
 Never mind the withered words of 
 Encouragement Pulling off my anorak 
 Dumping out my black backpack 
 Take what you like I'll keep on walking
 
 You're so proud of your circular karate chop 
 Afternoons in the mirror doing pop and lock 
 From the junk shop to the truck stop to the big big top
 
 You're still bragging about your telescoping roundhouse kick 
 You're still looking for your 
 Commodore's old control stick 
 So myopic, stay on topic 
 And this world is sick
 
 Three rules from your sensei
 One, Outsource your feelings. 
 Two, Limit your training to be task-specific. 
 Three, Assign regret to those accountable.
 
 Detention hall, name on the wall and 
 Locker dent Never mind the withered words of

 Dumping out my black backpack 
 Take what you like I'll keep on walking
 
 You're so proud of your circular karate chop 
 Afternoons in the mirror doing pop and lock 
 From the junk shop to the truck stop to the big big top
 
 You're still braggin' about your telescoping roundhouse kick

 Commodore's old control stick So myopic, stay on topic 
 Man, this world is sick
 
 Uh huh
 Uh huh uh huh
 Uh huh 
 Uh huh uh huh
 Uh huh
 Clap your hands 
 Stomp your feet 
 Jump in the air 
 
 I can't talk, I got to go
 Don't call me back, I won't get the door
 Got to focus on the job
 'Cause I got a new job climbing the walls
 
 I was grinding my teeth, I was wasting my youth
 And using up my teeth
 Now I'm done chewing my nails
 Hanging my head, chasing my tail
 It got so bad I quit my job
 Then I got a new job climbing the walls
 
 Too much junk, too much junk
 Can we please clear out this house?
 In the trunk, in the trunk
 And then we'll take it all to the dump
 Then we won't need the car
 'Cause we'll stay where we are
 And I'll have all this room
 
 I got tired of pacing the floor
 Sick of it all, I'm done with the floor
 Walked away ever since I got a new job climbing the walls
 
 I was grinding my teeth, I was wasting my youth
 And using up my teeth
 Now I'm done chewing my nails
 Hanging my head, chasing my tail
 It got so bad I quit my job
 Then I got a new job climbing the walls
 
 The deep end, the deep end
 People talk a lot, but they don't know
 They pretend, they pretend
 They don't really know how deep it goes
 
 Now I misunderstood,
 Thought the wall was just good
 For staring blankly at
 
 I got tired of pacing the floor
 Sick of it all, I'm done with the floor
 Walked away ever since I got a new job climbing the walls
 
 Now I'm done chewing my nails
 Hanging my head, chasing my tail
 It got so bad I quit my job
 Then I got a new job climbing the walls
 Got a new job climbing the walls
 Got a new job climbing the walls
 
 One, two, three, four
 
 Mind your business
 Mind your business
 Mind your never-shut Quonset hut business
 My craft is exploding
 It's like I'm making cloisonn'
 Choking on my dust
 With my three blind cats
 You have a friend in law enforcement
 Don't go calling law enforcement
 Business
 Mind your business
 
 Got too busy explaining
 Now it's just raining pain
 Pain in the form of a rain drop
 Yes, a rain drop made of pain
 Tell 'em the story, rain drop
 "I don't want to tell 'em, mister!"
 Tell 'em the story, rain drop
 "I don't want to tell 'em!"
 Keep your voice down
 Keep your voice down
 Keep your window-shaking godforsaken voice down
 I'm sick of this beeswax
 I'm sick of these second-story Sleestaks
 Breathing on my dice
 Giving me back rubs
 
 When I'm deep in concentration
 You start getting all conversatin'
 Sleestak
 What's a Sleestak?
 That's your heart attack
 Towel rack fallback
 You got no doctors
 All your doctors have gone home
 What's a Sleestak?
 What's a Sleestak?
 You have a friend in law enforcement
 Don't go calling law enforcement
 Cloisonn'
 
 You, to me
 Are sweet as roses in the morning
 You, to me
 Are soft as summer in that dawning love we share
 That something rare
 
 The sidewalks and the street
 The concrete and the clay beneath my feet
 Begin to crumble
 But love will never die
 You know we'll see the mountains crumble
 Before we say goodbye
 My love and I will be
 In love eternally
 That's the way
 That's the way love was meant to be
 
 All around
 I see the purple shades of evening
 On the ground
 The shadow's fallen, once again you're in my arms
 So tenderly
 
 The sidewalks and the street
 The concrete and the clay beneath my feet
 Begin to crumble
 But love will never die
 You know we'll see the mountains crumble
 Before we say goodbye
 My love and I will be
 In love eternally
 That's the way
 That's the way love was meant to be
 
 The sidewalks and the street
 The concrete and the clay beneath my feet
 Begin to crumble
 But love will never die
 You know we'll see the mountains crumble
 Before we say goodbye
 My love and I will be
 In love eternally
 That's the way
 That's the way love was meant to be
 
 That's the way
 That's the way love was meant to be
 
 
 You know what's wrong with me
 You know phrenology
 You saw my injury
 You can tell just by looking at my skull
 
 Contrecoup, on the rebound
 Contrecoup hurt me again
 And the second was worse by far than the first
 'Cause it made me limerent
 
 When my head was hit
 I bounced away from it
 Or as someone who is craniosophic would say
 The brain went the opposite way
 
 Contrecoup, on the rebound
 Contrecoup hurt me again
 And the second was worse by far than the first
 'Cause the first one woke my feelings for you
 But the contrecoup made my words untrue
 And it left me limerent
 which is to say
 
 How it goes
 Couched in terms
 No one knows
 And as if the choice were slim
 As if there's no sentiment
 
 You know what's wrong with me
 You know phrenology
 You saw my injury
 You can tell just by looking at my skull
 
 Contrecoup, on the rebound
 Contrecoup hurt me again
 And the second was worse
 by far than the first
 Though the impulse is strong
 the connection is weak
 But I know what to say
 But forgot how to speak
 When it made me limerant.
 
 Hey, hey, counterfeit fake

 History wants you, they made a mistake
 
 Call out the undertaker
 Call out the police
 Counterfeit Faker
 Is coming after me
 
 Yes, I loved him like my brother
 I loved him ambiguously
 There's no way to measure the damage he has done
 
 Counterfeit Faker
 Carries a grudge
 
 Nervous, I walk through windows
 I walk through a plate glass door
 Silent, his presence mocks me
 And draws me on some more
 
 Counterfeit Faker
 The damage has been done
 
 The damage has been done
 The damage has been done
 Counterfeit Faker
 Bring him on

 I'm going down to Cowtown
 The cow's a friend to me
 Lives beneath the ocean and that's where I will be
 Beneath the waves, the waves
 And that's where I will be
 I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea
 
 The yellow Roosevelt Avenue leaf overturned
 The ardor of arboreality is an adventure we have spurned, we've spurned
 A new leaf overturned
 It's a new leaf overturned
 
 And so I'm going down to Cowtown
 The cow's a friend to me
 Lives beneath the ocean and that's where I will be
 Beneath the waves, the waves
 And that's where I will be
 I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea
 
 We yearn to swim for home, but our only home is bone
 How sleepless is the egg knowing that which throws the stone
 Foresees the bone, the bone
 Our only home is bone
 Our only home is bone
 
 And so I'm going down to Cowtown
 The cow's a friend to me
 Lives beneath the ocean and that's where I will be
 Beneath the waves, the waves
 And that's where I will be
 I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea
 
 Yes I'm going down to Cowtown
 The cow's a friend to me
 Lives beneath the ocean and that's where I will be
 Beneath the waves, the waves
 And that's where I will be
 I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea
 Yes I'm gonna see 
 The cow 
 Beneath the sea

 Davey: Mmm. French Fries.
 Other Guy: Mmm. Yea, they're good. Gee Davey, Strong Bad always seems so hostile. I bet he doesn't even know how much everybody loves him.
 Davey: Nope, nope I don't think so either.
 Other Guy: Nope.
 Davey: I've written a song I think'll make Strong Bad understand. I'm gonna sing it.
 
 Uh huh
 Strong Bad:  I already don't like the sound of this one. Ohh, vomit-inducing! My favorite!
 Come down from your crystal fortress, oh Strong Bad
 Strong Bad: What?
 A unicorn awaits at a rainbow bridge
 Strong Bad: Unicorns? Wh-who are you?
 Her head is bowed and a tiny tear traces these words in the dew
 Strong Bad: Alright, you whiny weasels

 Oh!

 Strong Bad: Aww! I thought you were done
 The love you deny is the key that will melt the lock
 Strong Bad: I'll melt your face!

 I tell you how to cyclops rock,

 You waste my cyclops time,
 And mess up my cyclops mind.
 
 I'm sick, like Chuckie was sick, my defeated heart keeps beating on,
 I won't die, like Chuckie won't die, but I'm not here to socialize,
 Gotta find a new place to hang out, 'cause I'm tired of living in hell.
 I'm a mess since you cut me out, but Chuckies arm keeps me company,
 I'm a fright, with my tombstone smile, all the children run away from me.
 Gotta find new friends to hang with, 'cause you're all afraid of me.
 
 It was sweet, like lead paint is sweet, but the after-effect left me paralyzed,
 I just stare with my one glass eye, hoping you won't be back again.
 There's a whole new generation, waiting to be wrecked by you.
 
 Pony, twist, monkey and frug, these are the things that I taught to you.
 Hitchhike, boogie, hypocrite bop, I'm stuck in a van outside of New York, ah!
 
 D, look at D
 Half a circle, half a moon, an apple slice
 There goes D, Captain D
 My boy D, Commander D, the well-known D
 D's getting on in years so he moves a little bit slower now
 D is shy and doesn't get out of the house much anymore
 
 "W, you think you're so great"
 "Well, I am pretty big"
 "Yeah, you're okay. You're just not as great as you think you are."
 "How come I never see you around anymore, D?"
 "I got this big TV set at home now. And I like to watch the sports."
 
 And then there's W, here comes W
 It's double wide, it cannot hide its pride, it's W
 They call it W, there's that W
 It thinks it's king, its all-time favorite thing is W
 
 Hey John.
 Oh hey John.
 What's going on?
 Man, I'm confused.
 You're confused, why?
 I, I'm no good at remembering stuff.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 Like what?
 
 I can't remember what D is for!
 You can't remember what D is for?!
 
 I think it's for an instrument you play in a band.
 I'm surprised you can't remember what D is for.
 
 I can't remember there's too much noise.
 Put your thinking cap on, I'll give you a hint.
 
 See I can't find my thinking cap, I think it's lost!
 John, come on tell me, D is for what?
 
 D is for something that you play with sticks.
 That's right, that's right, you're getting close.
 
 D is for Drums, yes D is for Drums!
 D is for Drums, yes D is for Drums!
 
 Well, I'm glad we got that straight.
 Hey John, I need,
 Yeah?
 I need some juice.
 I've got some juice.
 Well, let's go to your house.
 Okay. I'll meet you over there.
 Okay.
 D is for Drums, D is for Drums!
 
 Tell the moon you've seen the serpent Found the sword and walked among the 
 Trees 
 
 Trees 
 
 Tell the moon you've seen the serpent Found the sword and walked among the  
 Trees 
 
 Trip the forest through the branches On the limb you fell the nest of  Bees 
 
 Tell the moon you've seen the serpent Found the sword and walked among the

 I'm not much of a natural dancer
 But I've got a friend who's a natural dancer
 You could call her a jumpin' bean
 She's got ants in her pants and she's gonna dance
 I know a girl who's a jumpin' bean
 She's got keys and a token when she hits the scene
 Yeah I know a girl who's got a record machine
 She acts like David Lee Roth when he turned 21
 
 I know a girl who's a natural dancer
 With a cape and a hat she's a natural dancer
 She coughs and she laughs and she makes a lot of calls
 And all of the people applaud
 As she leaves the store
 As she leaves the store 
 All of the people applaud  As she leaves the store
 As she leaves the store 
 All of the people applaud 
 
 Can she do the karaoke? Yes she can, but she won't
 'Cause she's highly qualified and she's not a joke
 When it comes to opera, she is ossified
 So all of you operas better step aside
 
 When my friend got amnesia
 She can't remember the show she saw
 Like the one with the guy with amnesia
 Who got off from the island on a helicopter
 
 I know a girl who's a natural dancer
 With a cape and a hat she's a natural dancer
 She coughs and she laughs and she makes a lot of calls
 And all of the people applaud
 As she leaves the store
 As she leaves the store 
 All of the people applaud 
 As she leaves the store
 As she leaves the store 
 All of the people applaud. 
 
 No taxi could take you
 No trains rolling by
 No bicycle shop, No planes in the sky
 Planes in the sky
 
 Not a night spent in jail
 Parrot on my arm
 Not a man of the world, no patch on my eye
 Patch on my eye
 
 Dark and metric is my town
 Every day and night
 Just because you're floating
 Doesn't mean you haven't drowned
 
 No spoiler, no wind scoop
 No mag wheels in back
 No hydraulic shocks, no privacy glass
 Privacy glass
 
 Dark and metric is my town
 North, east, west, and south
 Just because you're smiling
 Doesn't mean you haven't drowned
 
 I returned a bag of groceries
 Accidentally taken off the shelf
 Before the expiration date
 I came back as a bag of groceries
 Accidentally taken off the shelf
 Before the date stamped on myself
 
 Did a large procession wave their 
 Torches as my head fell in the basket, 
 And was everybody dancing on the casket? 
 
 Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want 
 Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
 
 I will never say the word
 "Procrastinate" again; I'll never
 See myself in the mirror with my eyes closed
 I didn't apologize for
 When I was eight and I made my younger brother
 Have to be my personal slave
 
 Did a large procession wave their 
 Torches as my head fell in the basket, 
 And was everybody dancing on the casket? 
 
 Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want 
 Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
 
  So I won't
  sit at home
  anymore
  and you won't
  see my head in
  the window
  and I won't
  be around
  ever anymore
  and I'll be up there on the wall at the store
 
 I returned a bag of groceries
 Accidentally taken off the shelf
 Before the expiration date
 I came back as a bag of groceries
 Accidentally taken off the shelf
 Before the date stamped on myself
 
 Did a large procession wave their 
 Torches as my head fell in the basket, 
 And was everybody dancing on the casket? 
 
 Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want 
 Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
 
 Now it's over I'm dead and I haven't done anything that I want 
 Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do

 Dee Dee and Dexter don't need no superpowers 
 They've got Mom and Dad
 And Dexter's Lab 
 To keep them occupied 
 
 Ah-ha! 
 Dee Dee bugs Dexter 
 And it's hard to get his way
 He's got a giant mind
 But still he finds
 His best plans go astray
 
 Ah-ha! 
 Dee Dee and Dexter!
 So right on! 
 Dee Dee and Dexter!
 You're favorite one! 
 Dee Dee and Dexter!
 It's comin' on!
 
 You know that Dexter
 Can make things grow big or small
 From hover crafts
 To clones that laugh
 To robots twelve feet tall! 
 
 Ah-ha! 
 Dee Dee and Dexter!
 So right on! 
 Dee Dee and Dexter!
 You're favorite one! 
 Dee Dee and Dexter!
 It's comin' on!
 
 Don't bother to call this room
 There's nobody here who can pick up
 Or has stuff they need to talk about
 And who won't be now
 Checking out and flying
 
 By rocket to the moon
 By airplane to the rocket
 By taxi to the airport
 By front door to the taxi
 By throwing back the blanket
 Hanging down the legs
 
 Thank you for the card with the cartoon nurse
 But you see there's nothing wrong with me
 You think, "That's what you think."
 "That's what they all say,"
 Before I blow you away
 
 By rocket to the moon
 By airplane to the rocket
 By taxi to the airport
 By front door to the taxi
 By throwing back the blanket
 Hanging down the legs
 
 Soon the man who sweeps the room
 Brings the secret telegram,
 "Commence official interplanetary exploration"
 
 Thank you for the card with the cartoon nurse
 But you see there's nothing wrong with me
 You think, "That's what you think."
 "That's what they all say,"
 Before I blow you away
 
 By rocket to the moon
 By airplane to the rocket
 By taxi to the airport
 By front door to the taxi
 By throwing back the blanket
 Hanging down the legs
 
 By rocket to the moon
 Crawl to the rocket
 By coughing at the airport 
 By limping to the taxi
 By throwing back the blanket
 Hanging down the withered leg
 
 Let's go backwards to destroy the past
 How long will your oxygen last?
 
 Though she didn't kill me
 She didn't make me stronger
 Though she didn't kill me
 Some parts didn't mend
 
 She shut down the sweet talk
 I sure felt like a goner
 When she shut down the sweet talk
 I thought that was the end
 
 Dig my grave
 Dig my grave
 
 Every time I look in your eyes
 I see St. Peter wave
 
 Dig my grave
 Dig my grave
 
 Every time you call my name
 I hear the angels say
 
 "Dig my grave"
 Dig my grave
 Dig my grave
 Dig my grave
 Dig my grave

 Here comes the dirt bike
 Beware of the dirt bike
 Because I hear they're coming to our town
 They've got plans for everyone
 And now I hear they're over their sophomore jinx, so you had better check it out
 
 All hail the dirt bike
 Philosopher dirt bike
 Silence as we gathered round
 We saw the word and were on our way
 Now it's
 
 Brain washing dirt bike
 Ground shaking dirt bike
 Mind bending dirt bike
 In control
 
 Soul crushing dirt bike
 Self propelled dirt bike
 You see I never thought I'd understand
 'Til that bike took me by the hand
 Now I ride
 Ride
 Ride
 
 "This, uh, song. This song is called other
 show. Other kind of show. It's
 called 'Disappointing Show.'"
 
 Disappointing show
 I saw it
 Disappointing show
 Man those guys blow
 Disappointing show
 Get your shit together
 Disappointing show
 Man those guys blow
 
 "On the drums, Mr. Joseph Stalin on the drums,
 ladies and gentlemen, man. Some
 other guy on the bass. Check
 him out. Whoa! Slow down, slow down.
 Oh, on the guitar, yeah,
 that's... play it, son.
 Yeah."
 
 Disappointing show yeah
 Man, those guys blow
 I tried to sing along
 Then it all went wrong
 Disappointing show
 Then the next song came on
 That's when it all went wrong
 And the PA fell on the crowd
 Then the cops came
 And took us away
 For an extended period of questioning about the PA
 What went wrong?
 Should've rehearsed more
 And talked about the song sequence
 Disappointing show
 
 My name is Dr. Worm.
 Good morning. How are you? I'm Dr. Worm.
 I'm interested in things.
 I'm not a real doctor,
 But I am a real worm;
 I am an actual worm.
 I live like a worm.
 
 I like to play the drums.
 I think I'm getting good,
 But I can handle criticism.
 I'll show you what I know,
 And you can tell me if you think I'm getting better on the drums.
 I'll leave the front un-locked 'cause I can't
 Hear the doorbell
 
 When I get into it I can't tell if you are
 Watching me twirling the stick.
 When I give the signal, my friend
 Rabbi Vole will pay the solo
 
 Some day somebody else besides me will
 Call me by my stage name, they will
 Call me Dr Worm.
 Good Morning how are you, I'm Dr Worm
 I'm interested in things.
 I'm not a real doctor,
 But I am a real worm;
 I am an actual worm.
 I live like a worm.
 
 I like to play the drums.
 I think I'm getting good,
 But I can handle criticism.
 I'll show you what I know,
 And you can tell me if you think I'm getting better on the drums.
 I'm not a real doctor,
 But they call me Dr. Worm.
 
 Showdown at the battery
 Showdown at the battery now
 Showdown at the battery
 Showdown
 
 Put down that snowball now
 Got no inclination to play around
 Must be hard for you Draculas
 When nobody's scared of you
 
 I take the long way home
 Stay realistic and stay awake
 My mind is a wrecking ball
 And someday my mind's going to wreck you all
 
 Showdown at the battery
 Showdown at the battery now
 Showdown at the battery
 Showdown
 
 Can you choose your weapon please
 Don't you know I come prepared
 I am a dog walker
 But someday I'll be a dog
 
 Dollar for dollar
 Invest in the past
 
 Don't don't don't let's start
 This is the worst part
 Could believe for all the world
 That you're my precious little girl
 But don't don't don't let's start
 I've got a weak heart
 And I don't get around how you get around
 
 When you are alone you are the cat, you are the phone
 You are an animal
 The words I'm singing now
 Mean nothing more than meow to an animal
 Wake up and smell the cat food in your bank account
 But don't try to stop the tail that wags the hound
 
 D, world destruction
 Over and overture
 N, do I need
 Apostrophe T, need this torture?
 
 Don't don't don't let's start
 This is the worst part
 Could believe for all the world
 That you're my precious little girl
 But don't don't don't let's start
 I've got a weak heart
 And I don't get around how you get around
 
 No one in the world ever gets what they want and that is beautiful
 Everybody dies frustrated and sad and that is beautiful
 They want what they're not and I wish they would stop saying,
 Deputy dog dog a ding dang depadepa
 Deputy dog dog a ding dang depadepa
 
 D, world destruction
 Over and overture
 N, do I need
 Apostrophe T, need this torture?
 
 Don't don't don't let's start
 This is the worst part
 Could believe for all the world
 That you're my precious little girl
 But don't don't don't let's start
 I've got a weak heart
 And I don't get around how you get around
 
 I don't want to live in this world anymore
 I don't want to live in this world
 
 Don't don't don't let's start
 This is the worst part
 Could believe for all the world
 That you're my precious little girl
 But don't don't don't let's start
 I've got a weak heart
 And I don't get around how you get around
 
 I think you have another song for us. 
 Would you like to perform it?
 
 What's the name of the song?
 
 Oh, I think I know that one! 
 Great, great.

 Down down down
 Down to the bottom of the sea

 Evil, evil is his one and only name
 Evil, in his mind there is no other game!
 
 When your name is Evil, that is good or so you think, 
 but you're so very wrong. 
 It's evil!
 But being wrong is right, so then you're good again,
 which is the evilest thing of all...
 
 Do you find his sudden ways, invite you? does he excite you?
 If his contradictions should atract you, should he distract you?
 
 Heaven help you then...
 You're finished, it's the end...
 There'll be no retrieval...
 From the evil...
 
 The evil,
 he will
 do.
 He's evil, 
 he's Doctor Evil.
 His name is Evil.
 
 I'll take back my pinata it's wasted on you
 Just spinning that pool cue all over the room
 And give back the blindfold that's under your shoe
 
 Let's drink, drink this town is so great
 Drink, drink 'cause it's never too late
 To drink, drink to no big surprise
 But what words rhyme with buried alive
 What words rhyme with buried alive
 
 You could be a float for the 4th of July
 Based on your theme of wallflowers grown wild
 Look through your peephole, you've won every prize
 
 In your monkey suit on a cigarette break
 The lunchtime crowd, they won't even blink
 But you'd be sad if they did
 But you'll be sad
 
 A hardly has an appetite
 And pokes at food too long
 And B can barely bother
 Because all the food is wrong 
 See likes only candy 
 And chocolate by the box 
 D is just disinterested 
 In anything you've got 
 
 But E eats everything 
 Yeah, E eats everything 
 E eats everything 
 Yeah, E eats everything 
 
 So toss in on a plastic plate 
 Or stick it with a fork 
 Serve it with a shovel
 Or serve it on a spork
 
 Yeah, E eats everything 
 Yeah, E eats everything 
 
 F is far too fussy 
 And only eats with fancy wine 
 G eats only gourmet 
 But never can decide 
 H burns food so horrible 
 All I tastes is smoke 
 J just likes drinking juice 
 And K drinks only soda 
 
 But E eats everything 
 Yeah, E eats everything 
 
 E is eating in a moving car 
 E is eating upside down 
 E is eating on a spaceship 
 E is eating off the ground 
 
 L and M and N and P 
 Won't start 'til O arrives 
 Q and are and S and T 
 Are wearing clothes much too tight 
 You and V and W 
 Are worn out from this song 
 And X and why just will not share 
 And will not get along 
 
 But E eats everything 
 Yeah, E eats everything 
 
 But look out now, here it comes 
 That final letter Z 
 Now Z's not like the other letters 
 Z's only eating E's 
 Yeah, Z eats E's 
 Yeah, Z eats E's 
 Z eats E's 
 Yeah, Z eats E's
 
 The Edison Museum, not open to the public
 Its haunted towers rise into the clouds above it
 Folks drive in from out of town
 To gaze in amazement when they see it
 
 Just outside the gate I look into the courtyard
 Underneath the gathering thunderstorm
 Through the iron bars, I see the Black Maria
 Revolving slowly on its platform
 In the topmost tower, a light burns dim
 A coiling filament glowing within
 
 The Edison Museum, once a bustling factory
 Today is but a darkened, cobweb covered hive of industry
 The tallest, widest and most famous haunted mansion in New Jersey
 
 Behind a wooden door, the voice of Thomas Alva
 Recites a poem on a phonograph
 Ghosts float up the stair, like silent moving pictures
 The loyal phantoms of his in-house staff
 A wondrous place it is, there can be no doubt
 But no one ever goes in, and no one ever goes out
 
 So when your children quarrel and nothing seems to quell them
 Just tell them that you'll take them to the Edison Museum
 The largest independently owned and operated mausoleum
 
 Istanbul was Constantinople
 Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople
 Been a long time gone, Constantinople
 Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night 
 Every gal in Constantinople
 Lives in Istanbul, not Constantinople
 So if you've a date in Constantinople
 She'll be waiting in Istanbul
 
 Even old New York
 Was once New Amsterdam
 
 So take me back to Constantinople 
 No, you can't go back to Constantinople 
 Been a long time gone, Constantinople 
 Why did Constantinople get the works? 
 That's nobody's business but the Turks' 
 
 Even old New York
 Was once New Amsterdam

 Got a job at the crumb factory
 It's my very first job
 I'm working at the crumb factory
 It's my number one job
 
 I'm employee of the month
 Number one crumb-makin' son of a gun
 I just need one sandwich and I'm set all day for making crumbs

 How thoughtless of me
 How dumb can you be?
 Hopeless, wasn't that
 What you called me and in fact
 It was even more true than you knew
 
 Where did the end of the rope go?
 I forget now, did I let go?
 After you left me hanging on your words
 Which hung down like a rope
 Where did the end of it go?
 I'll never know
 
 You're gone, but I'm still there
 Clawing at the air
 Now it's curtains for me
 And I'll spend eternity
 Doing joyless cartwheels in the void
 
 Where did the end of the rope go?
 I forget now, did I let go?
 Long ago you left me hanging on your words
 Which hung down like a rope from the sky
 Where did the end of it go?
 No one can ever know
 
 Where did the end of the rope go?
 I forget now, did I let go?
 Once upon a time you left me hanging from your words
 Which hung down in the ether like a rope from the sky
 Wherever did the end of it go?
 No one can ever know
 
 You and I will be together when we shed our memory
 I won't wear an orange sweater when I get it off of me
 When it's as it someday is it always will have been the case
 When your ever searching finger finds the button marked erase
 
 Finger find the button marked erase
 Like a deep sea diver falling into a mermaid's embrace
 Put one box on the sidewalk then you return with the next and the first one's gone
 Everyone gets on the bus out of town and the lights start going out one by one
 
 Button marked erase
 When darlings must be murdered 
 When your heartbreak overwhelms your heart
 
 Think of this as solving problems that should never have occurred 
 Please don't call it strangulation, that is such an ugly word
 
 Press erase, ignore the shrill alarms
 See the way the deep sea diver falls into the mermaid's arms
 Put one box on the sidewalk then you return with the next and the first one's gone
 Everyone gets on the bus out of town and the lights start going out one by one
 
 Button marked erase
 When darlings must be murdered 
 When your heartbreak overrides the very
 Thing you can not face
 The skeletons that won't stay down
 The mercy kill that can't be drowned
 
 Put
 Box
 Sidewalk
 Then
 Return
 Next
 First one gone
 
 Everyone
 On
 Bus
 Out
 Lights
 Out
 One by one
 
 Finger find the button marked erase
 Like a deep sea diver falling into a mermaid's embrace
 Put one box on the sidewalk then you return with the next and the first one's gone
 Everyone gets on the bus out of town and the lights start going out one by one 
 
 Escape from the 'Planet of the Apes'
 Well we gotta escape from the 'Planet of the Apes'
 'Cause all our friends are on different planet
 Yes all my friends are on a different planet now
 Gotta escape from the 'Planet of the Apes'

 I've got a star ship that will take you to the planet where Mick Jagger lives
 We've gotta escape to the 'Planet of the Apes'
 We've gotta escape to the 'Planet of the Apes' before we explode

 Everything right is wrong again
 Just like in the long long trailer
 All the dishes got broken and the car kept driving
 And nobody would stop to save her
 
 Wake me when it's over, touch my face
 Tell me every word has been erased
 Don't you want to know the reason
 Why the cupboard's not appealing
 Don't you get the feeling that
 
 Everything that's right is wrong again
 You're a weasel overcome with dinge
 Weasel overcome but not before the damage done
 The healing doesn't stop the feeling
 
 Everything right is wrong again
 Just like in the long long trailer
 All the dishes got broken and the car kept driving
 And nobody would stop to save her
 
 And now the song is over now
 And now the song is over now
 And now the song is over now
 The song is over now
 
 Everything right is wrong again
 Every movement false, every four is waltz again
 Every five and dime's been gained and spent
 Tell me that you like my float upstream
 Draw the line dividing laugh and scream
 You know everything that I know so I know
 You've heard the voice that makes the silent noise
 That says that
 
 Everything that's right is wrong again
 You're a weasel overcome with dinge
 Weasel overcome but not before the damage done
 The healing doesn't stop the feeling
 
 Everything right is wrong again
 Just like in the long long trailer
 All the dishes got broken and the car kept driving
 And nobody would stop to save her
 
 And now the song is over now
 And now the song is over now
 And now the song is over now
 The song is over now
 
 The color of infinity
 Inside an empty glass
 I'm squinting my eye
 I'm turning off and on and on and off the light
 It's for this experimental film
 Which nobody knows about and which 
 I'm still figuring out what's going to go in my experimental film
 
 Yeah!
 You're all gonna be in this experimental film 
 And even though I can't explain it, I already know how great it's
 
 I already know the ending
 It's the part that makes your face implode
 I don't know what makes your face implode, 
 But that's the way the movie ends
 And in my experimental film
 Which nobody knows about but which
 I'm still figuring out
 Your face implodes at my experimental film
 
 Yeah!
 You're all gonna be in this experimental film 
 And even though I can't explain it, I already know how great it's
 And even though I can't explain it, I already know how great it's
 
 The color of infinity

 What's going to go in my experimental film
 
 Yeah!

 And even though I can't explain it, I already know how great it's
 
 Yeah!
 You're gonna be in this experimental film 
 And even though I can't explain it, I already know how great it's
 And even though I can't explain it, I already know how great it's
 
 Exquisite dead guy
 Rotating in his display case
 Exquisite dead guy
 Swear I saw his mouth move
 
 Exquisite dead guy
 Outside my high rise apartment
 Exquisite dead guy
 Hanging from a sky hook
 
 How am I supposed to let you know the way I feel
 About you

 When I walk down the street, most guys look like elves
 I don't mean to put them down but they do
 It's hard to understand me from the language I use
 There's no word in English for my style
 
 What's a man like me supposed to do
 With all this extra savoir-faire
 What is left for me to prove, dear
 
 I know just what to do when the ladies come 'round
 You can try to copy me but you'll fail
 Now, you might think you're different but time will prove me right
 When you wake up from your dream I'll be gone
 
 What's a man like me supposed to do
 With all this extra savoir-faire
 What is left for me to prove, dear
 
 Fake out

 Fake it to me
 What is fake?
 Fake TV
 Land of a thousand fake outs
 Fake worse than death

 Fake your claim
 Fake around the clock
 Winner fake all
 Three fakes, you're out

 Fake-Believe, Fake-believe, Fake-believe 
 F is for Fake-Believe
 
 F is for fun
 F is for fun
 F is for fake-believe
 
 We're wearing fake fur, and riding on alpacas
 On the wild frontier, wearing wax mustaches
 Pretending we're cowhands, yodeling like cowhands too
 
 Now look at my crown, I'm acting mighty bossy
 I'm king of this town, and  gets extra frosty
 From this moment on, please call me Lord Fauntleroy
 That's Little Lord Fauntleroy, please
 
 Fake-Believe, Fake-believe, Fake-believe 
 F is for Fake-Believe
 
 You never write, you never call
 And now you wander in the hall
 You look familiar;
 I barely know your face at all
 
 We never get together at all
 Until the last day of Hanukkah.
 I got you a harmonica
 And a bag of chocolate coins.
 
 The only thing we have is fights,
 But there's got to be a change tonight.
 Please be nice on this feast of lights.

 Now I know just what to do
 Feign amnesia
 How I wish it wasn't true
 Wish it wasn't true right now
 
 Not much quiet about reinvention
 Why have settled for stuff that is half-new?
 Like a volume beyond comprehension
 If the bass won't get you,
 The treble will get you
 
 I'll look busy just for you
 And feign amnesia
 How I wish it wasn't true
 Wish it wasn't true right now
 Wish it wasn't true right now
 
 Hers are the brains
 Floating on an upstream train
 Hers are the brains
 Barbarians and seeds are lost in the remains
 
 We were standing outside a sidewalk
 With that crazy guy dancing behind us
 With our forced smiles and all of the laughter
 They must  to hear that right
 
 Now I know just what to do
 Feign amnesia
 How I wish it wasn't true
 Wish it wasn't true right now
 
 I'll look busy just for you
 And feign amnesia
 How I wish it wasn't true
 Wish it wasn't true right now
 Wish it wasn't true right now

 Here on Fibber Island
 We strum rubber guitars.
 Our friends live on mars.  
 And we sew buttons on our cars.
 
 Here on Fibber Island 
 Our house is made of pie, 
 Our dog is 2 miles wide 
 And all he talks about is pie.
 
 Here on Fibber Island
 We swim on the ground.
 Wheels are square not round. 
 We eat chocolate by the pound.
 
 Here on Fibber Island
 No one sings alone, 
 We just ride giraffes 
 And wear bicycles for hats
 
 To get to Fibber Island
 You just close your eyes
 Start fibbing in your mind
 And see what you can find.  
 
 Here on Fibber Island
 We hide mittens in our hair, 
 You might need to stare
 To see the mittens in our hair
 
 Come to Fibber Island
 And strum rubber guitars 
 Meet our friends from mars 
 And sew buttons on our cars
 
 Round, can you go around?
 And if you can turn around without falling down
 You can skate in a figure eight
 If you can turn, if you can go straight
 
 Turn left, go straight, turn right, straight again
 And then do it over, repeat forever
 That's all you need to know
 That's the way you skate in a figure eight
 
 If you can grab a circle in your hands
 And twist it, that's an eight
 
 If it weren't for the Zamboni
 You would never leave the ice
 And I think I know the reason why
 You never take a break
 The sign that means forever
 Is a sideways number eight
 
 Turn left, go straight, turn right, straight again
 And then do it over, repeat forever
 That's all you need to know
 That's the way you skate in a figure eight
 
 And if you twist the number zero
 You will get the number eight
 
 Turn left, go straight, turn right, straight again
 And then do it over, repeat forever
 That's all you need to know
 That's the way you skate in a figure eight
 
 If you can grab a circle in your hands
 And twist it, that's an eight
 
 Twist the number zero
 You will get the number eight

 I found a new friend
 Underneath my pillow
 
 Come on and wreck my car

 All alone all alone
 All by myself
 
 What's that blue thing doing here?
 What's that blue thing doing here?
 
 Something grabbed a hold of my hand
 I didn't know what had my hand
 But that's when all my troubles began
 
 I don't understand you 
 I just don't understand you 
 I don't understand the things you say
 I can't understand a single word
 I don't understand you 
 I just don't understand you 
 I cannot understand you 
 I don't understand you 
 
 I heard a sound, I turned around
 I turned around to find the thing
 That made the sound
 
 Mysterious whisper
 Mysterious whisper

 The day that love came to play
 
 I'm having a heart attack
 I'm having a heart attack

 Now I'm telling the truth
 I'm finished with lies, lies
 If you don't believe me now
 You'll never believe me now
 
 I should have my head examined
 They'll see when they look inside
 I won't have to say a word
 I'll stop thinking what I shouldn't be thinking
 I'll make everyone believe me now
 
 Can't you see I'm telling the truth
 Now I'm telling the truth
 I'm finished with lies, lies
 If you don't believe me now
 You'll never believe me now
 You'll think it's a lie
 
 Couldn't we just put away the ancient history
 Throw up our hands at the unsolved mystery
 
 I'm going to have my head examined
 I'll prove you were wrong about me
 Move the needle telepathically
 I'll turn everything around and confuse you
 Talk faster and faster til I lose you
 I'll fix it so you can't remember what was true
 And there'll be nothing to remind you
 
 Starting now I'm telling the truth
 I'm finished with lies, lies
 If you don't believe me now
 You'll never believe me now
 
 Now I'm telling the truth
 I'm finished with lies, lies
 If you don't believe me now
 You'll never believe me now
 Lies, lies
 
 You'll think it's a lie
 You'll think it's a lie
 You'll think it's a lie
 
 Flying V
 If you're standing underneath it, you will see when you inspect it
 That a flying V is made of flying geese
 The pointed end flies in the lead
 So when it flies, it's hard to read
 You've got to tip your head to see
 Flying V, Flying V
 
 It's a V
 In the window of a music store, or on stage at a rock show
 Now a flying V is made of a guitar
 The pointed end flies in the lead
 So when it flies, it's hard to read
 You have to be upside-down to see it
 
 There has been a spacecraft sighted
 Flying high above the sky
 Sirens declare there's one among us from Venus
 
 Volunteers, we need volunteers
 Soldiers to meet them
 Have no fear
 Have no fear
 You will be killed right away
 
 I will date the girl from Venus
 Flowers die and so will I
 Yes, I will kiss the girl from Venus for science
 
 I'm so brave
 I'm so brave
 I'll be her love slave
 
 He's so brave
 He's so brave
 He'll be her love slave forever
 
 Yes, I will date the girl from Venus
 Flowers die and so will I
 Yes, I will kiss the girl from Venus for science
 
 Let's get those missiles ready to destroy the universe!
 
 Underneath a big clock at the corner of 5th Avenue and 22nd Street
 I stood and waiting for a girl I knew at the spot where we agreed to meet
 It was four minutes of two
 
 At four of two, I stood waiting for the girl
 I was four minutes early for the date we had planned
 I was planning to say I was in love with her
 Just as soon as she showed for a two o'clock date
 And the clock said four of two
 
 At four of two, I was staring into space
 She was not yet late, according to the clock
 I was feeling nervous so I kept looking up
 At the clock sticking out of the side of the building
 And it still said four of two
 
 At four of two, I began to feel tired
 And I rubbed my eyes, and again I checked the time
 It seemed as if the sky was growing dark
 But I felt reassured when I looked at the clock
 And it still said four of two
 
 I lay my head down on the sidewalk so in case she were coming I would have a better view
 But no one was there so I stretched out and closed my eyes for a second or two
 It was four minutes of two
 
 At once I awoke to a futuristic world
 There were flying cars and gigantic metal bugs
 I'd grown a beard; it was long and white
 But I knew that the girl would be coming very soon
 For though everything had changed, there was still that clock
 And it still said four of two
 
 You to me
 Like a magnet to a flame
 Like a mirror in the dark
 And we're off to a bad start again
 
 Dawn begins
 This is what the summer became
 Only strangers walking down from the beach
 Where did we bury the time?
 
 Fun assassin, killing fun for kicks
 Stab me in the front, tell me that I'm jinxed
 Fun assassin, take off your disguise
 Look me in the eye and lie
 
 Lost in space
 Waiting for a bus from this place
 And when I get there, I'll just fold up my map
 Drop it and never look back
 
 Fun assassin, hijack the parade
 Suck out all the air, polish up the cage
 Fun assassin, treat me like I'm stone
 Push me to the back and moan
 
 Fun assassin, pulling out my hair
 Smash out all the lights, kicking out my chair
 Fun assassin, take off your disguise
 Look me in the eye and lie
 
 Gorillas in the jungle
 Gazelles out in the field
 Goats are in the barnyard
 And gophers in their holes
 
 Go, go, go, go for G
 Go, go, go, go for G
 You'll feel glorious, generous, gleeful and great
 When you go, go, go, go for G
 
 Goof balls in their go-carts
 Girl scouts chewing gum
 Grandma with her gingerbread
 And the drummer plays a gong
 
 Go, go, go, go for G
 Go, go, go, go for G
 You'll feel gracious, gigantic, grateful and glad
 When you go, go, go, go for G
 
 Grapes, glue, gyroscopes
 
 Go, go, go, go for G
 Go, go, go, go for G
 You'll feel glorious, generous, gleeful and great
 When you go, go, go, go for G
 
 Hello mind
 It's good to be awake again
 Spend some time reflecting
 
 Hello hand
 We all salute you hand
 Five fingers strong
 It's good to have you back again
 
 Hello eye
 The complicated eye
 Focused so hard on inspecting
 
 Hello leg
 Such a shaky leg
 Just barely more than decoration
 
 I'm not a motivational speaker 
 But on this I have arrived
 It's good to be alive
 Good to be alive
 
 Hello hand
 We all salute you hand
 Five fingers strong
 It's good to have you back again
 
 I'm not some mega-church style preacher
 But my spirit is revived
 It's good to be alive 
 Good to be alive 
 
 I'm not a life coach or some teacher
 But I think we'll all survive
 It's good to be alive 
 Good to be alive 
 
 Goodnight, my friends
 Goodnight, my friends
 
 Sweet dreams from A-B-C Land
 
 I've got the hairdo of a child
 It's so unruly 
 It doesn't suit me
 
 My hair is really growing wild
 It needs some schoolin'
 It needs some groomin'
 
 Oh! Radio!
 Can't you hear? Hear my plea?
 We need greasy kid stuff
 Greasy kid stuff yeah! 
 
 Oh yeah!
 
 My radio was out of style
 Like some old movie
 It wasn't groovy
 
 I tried to fake it for a while
 Songs by committee
 It was a pity
 
 Oh! Radio!
 Can't you hear? Hear my plea?
 We need greasy kid stuff
 Greasy kid stuff yeah! 
 
 Oh yeah!
 
 Oh yeah!
 
 Great, great, hey, Dave
 If you have a hundred
 Dollars, I can save you two
 Hundred dollars
 
 Dave, hey, Dave, hey wait
 Dave, where are you going
 With that hundred dollars
 In both of your fists?
 
 I'm going downtown 
 To get used up 
 
 Here in the hall of heads
 You look through the keyhole
 This is the hall of heads
 One step through the doorway
 
 Roll out that special head
 This is our favorite one
 Please don't try to leave
 Don't leave the hall of heads
 
 Hide underneath the porch
 Hide down behind the furnace
 You can't get away
 You can't really hide
 Once you hear the call
 The song of the hall of heads
 
 You can't run away
 Your feet won't help you run
 You can't run away
 Out of the hall of heads
 
 Don't hate the villain, hate the villanelle
 With these picky rules and odd jigsaw rhymes
 Curses, these verses are my prison cell
 
 At school, I ran from the very first bell
 The teacher's ruler, those maddening chimes
 Don't hate the villain, hate the villanelle
 
 Joking in class, oh, the words I misspell
 Mumbles and stammers, but are those real crimes?
 Curses, these verses are my prison cell
 
 If someone could hear, for someone to tell
 But friends have all fled to faraway climes
 Don't hate the villain, hate the villanelle
 
 I solve this puzzle, but tumble through Hell
 These words are fractions when I needed primes
 Curses, these verses are my prison cell
 
 My hand disappears as I wave farewell
 This gentle quicksand turns into hard times
 Don't hate the villain, hate the villanelle
 Curses, these verses are my prison cell
 
 Frosty the supervisor
 Lives by himself
 Sometimes I feel sorry for him
 Usually I can't
 
 I've turned off my hearing aid
 Don't say the electric chair's not good enough
 For king-lazy-bones like myself
 
 More coffee for me boss
 'Cause I'm not as messed up as I want to be
 
 I've turned off my hearing aid
 Don't say the electric chair's not good enough
 For king-lazy-bones like myself
 
 Because
 Because
 
 Four, three, two, one, go
 
 We all like to play in the band, uh huh
 We all like to play in the band, uh huh
 But the drummer is the heart of the band
 The drummer is the soul of the band
 The drummer is the core of the band, uh huh
 
 Even when we're playing
 If the drums aren't playing
 It's just like the song is standing still
 
 Even when we're playing
 If the drums aren't playing
 It's just like the song is standing still
 
 Four, three, two, one, go
 
 Yes, we have guitar in the band
 Yes, we have the bass in the band
 But the drummer is the heart of the band
 The drummer is the soul of the band
 The drummer is the core of the band, uh huh
 
 Even when we're playing
 If the drums aren't playing
 It's just like the song is standing still

 Salutations, pain is karma, bent joints in fighting words
 Got his mean streak from his mother, ha ha ha
 Now Love Boats paint his liver, with eyes on the city lights
 Collapsin' on the upbeats or relaxin' for the night
 He steps into a crazy hotel, the desk clerk hands him soap-on-a-rope
 What does he mean by this?
 Bellhop takes his flashlight, takes John up to his room
 Va-va-va-voom this is a sweet life, Anthrax on the couch
 
 We're here to entertain you, or have you seen this episode
 We're the ancient order of robots dials, we're putting you at the controls
 Welcome to Hell Hotel
 
 Sports cars and the gamblin', John's winning every night
 Well there's certain smells John can't repel, but Momma it can't be right
 He bolts awake laughing, but no one's in his room
 And the big boss man doesn't understand why John can't smile no more
 
 We're here to make you happy, that's all that we are programmed for
 But you say this pleasure's a pain for you, Sebastian C. could tell you more
 Welcome to Hell Hotel

 I could never sleep my way to the top
 'Cause my alarm clock always wakes me right up
 And since my options had been whittled away
 I struck a bargain with my radio DJ
 I said I'd like this song to be number one
 He said "I'd really really like to help you my son"
 And then I knew that I would have him to thank
 Because he asked me how much I had in the bank
 
 He said to think long term investment and
 That all the others had forgiven themselves
 He said the net reward would justify
 The colossal mess they'd made of their lives
 
 He said the record wouldn't have to be hot
 And no one ever seemed to care if it's not
 It would depend on something else that I've got
 And that the other ones who'd given it a shot
 Had seen a modest sum grow geometrically
 And then they had forgiven themselves
 Because the net reward had justified
 The colossal mess they'd made of their lives
 
 Hey Mr. DJ, I thought you said we had a deal
 I thought you said, "You scratch my back and I'll scratch your record"
 And I thought you said we had a deal
 
 Well, I told you about the world 
 I wonder when they're gonna clean up the mess
 You know the rabid child is still tuning in
 Chess piece face's patience must be wearing thin
 Because they haven't played this song on the air
 Not that anyone but me even cared
 And the Disk Jockey has moved out of town
 The district courthouse says he's nowhere to be found
 
 He said to think long term investment and
 That all the others had forgiven themselves
 He said the net reward would justify
 The colossal mess they'd made of their lives
 
 Hey Mr. DJ, I thought you said we had a deal
 I thought you said, "You scratch my back and I'll scratch your record"
 And I thought you said we had a deal
 
 Hide away folk family
 Or else someone's gonna get ya 
 Someone's gonna get ya
 Hide away folk family
 Better hide away
 Better hide away
 
 Tippy-toe to the front door, Mother,
 'Cause there's a guy with a long, long fuse
 And the one thing you can't hide is all the fear you feel inside
 As the fuse is spelling out these words
 
 Hide away folk family
 Or else someone's gonna get ya 
 Someone's gonna get ya
 Hide away folk family
 Better hide away
 Better hide away
 
 Tippy-toe to the flat-bed, Father,
 Because they're pouring out our gasoline
 And sadly the cross-eyed bear's been put to sleep behind the stairs
 And his shoes are laced with irony
 
 Hide away folk family
 Or else someone's gonna get ya 
 Someone's gonna get ya
 Hide away folk family
 Better hide away
 Better hide away

 Homunculus is by your side
 Ungrateful now and he's losing your trust
 Your old star map, a disco nap,
 And when you change you can't always change back
 
 Your headliner blues got 'em crying It
 Stuck in your head and now you're crying
 The tiny fake tears that you cry
 
 Your slender grasp
 M'bius strip
 The shiny things that you wanted to clip
 You took a sip and lost your place
 Three many windows shining back in your face
 
 Your headliner blues got 'em crying
 It stuck in your head and now you're crying
 The tiny fake tears that you cry
 
 Homunculus is by your side
 Ungrateful now and he's losing your trust
 Your old star map, a disco nap,
 And when you change you can't always change back
 And when you change you can't always change back
 And when you change you can't always change back
 
 I never knew what everybody meant
 By endless, hopeless, bleak despair
 Until one day when I found out
 The first time I ever left my house
 It saw me and followed me home
 And stayed with me for my whole life
 
 For years and years I wandered the earth
 Condemned to a life of bleak despair
 Then, one day, I looked around
 And found it had disappeared
 
 Hopeless bleak despair
 It was always there
 And then, one day, it disappeared
 In a puff of smoke
 In an unceremonious way
 One day, it disappeared
 
 All I had ever wanted in my life
 Was only to be free of it
 It drove away my family
 It made me lose my job
 Whenever anybody saw it
 They'd say "get out of here"
 
 For years and years I wandered the earth
 Sick of my life, looking forward to death
 Then, one day, I looked around
 And found it had disappeared
 
 Hopeless bleak despair
 It was always there
 And then, one day, it disappeared
 In a puff of smoke
 In an unceremonious way
 One day, it disappeared
 
 Hopeless bleak despair
 Hopeless bleak despair
 Hopeless bleak despair
 
 For years and years I wandered the earth
 Until I died and went to hell 
 But my despair had ascended to heaven
 That's how I finally got rid of it
 
 Hopeless bleak despair
 It was always there
 And then, one day, it disappeared
 In a puff of smoke
 In an unceremonious way
 One day, it disappeared
 
 Hopeless bleak despair
 It was always there
 And then, one day, it disappeared
 In a puff of smoke
 In an unceremonious way
 One day, it disappeared
 
 Hot Cha, where are you?
 Everybody's eyes are closed
 I can't see why I miss you so
 So hot Cha, where are you?
 
 First time hot Cha went away
 A floating island was his home
 Then the phone rang off the hook
 And hot Cha had to come back home
 
 Hot Cha, where are you?
 Everybody's eyes are closed
 I can't see why I miss you so
 So hot Cha, where are you?
 
 Second time he went away
 Left the bathtub running over
 Stereo on and cooking bacon
 Never came back to tell us why
 
 If that honey would come back
 We would throw such a party
 Drink and cook the prodigal son
 Fondue forks for everybody
 
 Hot Cha, where are you?
 Everybody's eyes are closed
 I can't see why I miss you so
 So hot Cha, where are you?
 Hot Cha, where are you?
 Hot Cha, where are you?
 
 Hot dog, oh no, hot dog
 
 Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggety dog
 Now we got ears, it's time for cheers
 Hot dog, hot dog, the problem's solved
 Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggety dog
 
 Grab my boots and a sandwich
 Let's start a parade
 Get the coconut drum kit
 For Daisy to play
 
 Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggety dog
 We're taking off, we're dancing now
 Hot dog, leapfrog and holy cow
 Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggety dog
 
 Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggety dog
 It's a brand new day, whatcha waiting for?
 Get up, stretch out, stomp on the floor
 Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggety dog
 
 Hot dog, hot dog, hot diggety dog
 We're splitting the scene, we're full of beans
 So long for now from Mickey Mouse
 And the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse
 
 I wanna go play where the geckos play
 Where I can't understand a word the people say
 Where the noonday sun burns you alive
 Down the ramp for of interstate 45
 
 Meridian
 Meridian
 Meridian Yeah
 
 I'm sleeping in the Astrodome 
 I'm sleeping in the dome

 Hey, hovering sombrero,
 Gently waving in the air above the meadow,
 Softly floating in the sky outside the window.
 
 Hovering sombrero, don't be shy,
 Don't - don't be shy,
 Don't be terrified.
 When you take yourself for granted,
 Feel rejected and unwanted,
 Know you're never just a hat you know,
 You're never only just a hat you know,
 Hovering sombrero.
 
 Time is flying like an arrow,
 And the clock hands go so fast they make the wind blow,
 And it makes the pages of the calendar go flying out the window one by one,
 Till a hundred years are on the front lawn,
 And the old familiar things are mostly all gone,
 But the old sombrero just keeps hovering on.
 Hovering sombrero, hover on.
 
 Don't be burdened by regrets,
 Or make your failures an obsession,
 Or become embittered or possessed,
 By ruined hopes remember --
 
 When you take yourself for granted,
 Feel rejected and unwanted,
 Know you're never just a hat you know,
 You're never only just a hat you know,
 Hovering sombrero.
 Hovering sombrero.
 
 Birds are calling to sing along
 But my window's painted shut
 And all that year of chorus taught me
 Is out of style and long forgot
 
 How can I sing like a girl
 And not be stigmatized
 By the rest of the world?
 Tell me how can I sing like a girl
 And not be objectified
 As if I were a girl?
 
 I want to raise my freak flag
 Higher and higher and
 I want to raise my freak flag
 And never be alone
 Never be alone
 
 From the watchtowers I've been spotted
 Fingers pointing at my mouth
 Spotlights turn and pivot towards me
 But I dare not make a sound
 
 How can I sing like a girl
 And not be stigmatized
 By the rest of the world?
 Tell me how can I sing like a girl
 And not be objectified
 As if I were a girl?
 
 I want to raise my freak flag
 Higher and higher and
 I want to raise my freak flag
 And never be alone
 Never be alone
 
 How can I sing like a girl
 And not be stigmatized
 By the rest of the world?
 Tell me how can I sing like a girl
 And not be objectified
 As if I were a girl?
 
 How can I sing like a girl
 
 How can I sing like a girl
 
 How can I sing like a girl
 
 How can I sing like a girl
 
 He's a hypnotist, hypnotist of ladies
 He's a hypnotist, hypnotist of ladies
 You're getting sleepy, very sleepy
 
 He's a hypnotist, hypnotist of ladies
 Never had a pocket watch, never counted backwards
 You won't remember why you liked him
 You won't remember why you liked him
 
 Juices, muffins, pasta and cheese
 Milk and biscuits and cocktail sauce
 I am a grocery bag
 Salsa and pickles and organic grains
 I am a grocery bag
 Fresh coffee and bagels
 Pudding and soap
 Baby formula and ham
 I am a grocery bag
 
 I'm a human head
 And my best friend is also a head
 I don't really need my best friend
 
 Now my friend is gone
 And I'm only a head by myself
 I find I don't need my whole head
 
 Now I'm just the top of a head
 Just the scalp and the hair
 I don't like the scalp, just the hair
 
 What do I really need?
 Best friend, also a head
 Just the head, just the scalp
 Hair
 
 Friend, no
 Head, no
 Scalp, no
 Hair
 
 I am only one human hair
 With no scalp for a home
 All I need's the top of a head
 
 Now all I am is just a skull
 I don't have any head
 I'd be glad if I had a head
 
 Now I have a head look at me
 I'm a fine floating head
 Where is my friend, the other head?
 
 Now broom you must now sweep for me the dust it fills my room
 No John I will not sweep for you for I am not your broom
 What nonsense are you speaking broom my words you must obey
 Another life awaits be and I'm leaving you today
 I am not your broom
 I am not your broom
 I've had enough I'm throwing off my chains of servitude
 I am not your broom
 I am not your broom
 No longer must I sweep for you for I am not your broom
 
 Ten miles from nowhere
 There's a story that's true
 About a fine girl and a boy just like you
 They fell so deeply
 But then fell apart
 Now they say the same words of what used to be
 What used to be:
 "I blame you"
 "I blame you"
 "I blame you"
 He drops his car keys
 And crawls on the ground
 Finds her old hair comb
 She'd wear into town
 Can't bear to keep it, or throw it away
 Gets back down on his knees
 Put it back where it lay
 Back where it lay
 "I blame you"
 "I blame you"
 "I blame you"

 To take a walk with me
 Put your hands where I can see them 
 I will need to see ID
 
 I can help the next in line
 Do we have a problem here?
 I can help the next in line
 If you would walk this way we'll settle this now
 
 Have you been with us in the past? 
 I can help the next one in line 
 I don't think that I like your tone

 I've got my house surrounded
 I know I'm in there
 Come out with both my hands up
 And don't make me come in and get me
 Don't make me come in and get me
 
 I can't hide from my mind
 Though I try, try, try
 I can't hide from my mind
 And you know why
 
 Running against the traffic
 To find where I lost you
 I'm catching up to the echos
 And I hear your voice from the buildings
 I hear your voice from the buildings
 
 I can't hide from my mind
 Though I try, try, try
 I can't hide from my mind
 And you know why
 
 The bars are in my eyes
 And kisses make you cry
 Smiles turned out misleading
 And memory's a lie
 
 I've got my house surrounded
 I know I'm in there
 Come out with both my hands up
 And don't make me come in and get me
 Don't make me come in and get me
 Don't make me come in and get me
 
 Sometimes I feel like being wispy
 And once in a while I feel like being dry
 But we're doomed and we're drowned by this feeling we surround
 So I hope that I get old before I die
 
 Ohhhhh
 It's a long, long rope they use to hang you soon I hope
 And I wonder why this hasn't happened
 Why why why
 And I think about the dirt that I'll be wearing for a shirt
 And I hope that I get old before I die
 
 Clear off the kitchen table darling
 For on the kitchen table I must lie
 I'm just tired for my wife just served the banquet of my life
 And I hope that I get old before I die
 
 Ohhhhh
 It's a long, long rope they use to hang you soon I hope
 And I wonder why this hasn't happened
 Why why why
 And I think about the dirt that I'll be wearing for a shirt
 And I hope that I get old before I die
 
 Ohhhhh
 It's a long, long rope they use to hang you soon I hope
 And I wonder why this hasn't happened
 Why why why
 And I think about the dirt that I'll be wearing for a shirt
 And I hope that I get old before I die
 
 I left my body
 And I went on a journey
 And I forgot where
 I left my body
 They're going to tow you
 If they think you're abandoned
 You got to act like you're not abandoned
 I left a notebook with all of my good ideas
 Keywords encoded cryptographically
 
 I'm waiting endlessly
 On the receptionist at the desk
 I'm searching high and low
 But I don't see anyone
 Don't see anyone
 Don't see anyone there
 
 I left my body
 With the old landlady
 But I don't know
 If she read the directions
 There must be something you can use on the carpet
 Someone might want that electric blanket
 
 Unfinished Manuscript and tungsten ring
 My plastic hip is going to be worth something
 I took the folding knife and my bat repellent soap
 I left my body
 And right away
 I knew I'd made a mistake
 I left without my senses
 And I can't see anything
 Can't see anything
 Can't see anything
 
 I'm waiting endlessly
 On the receptionist at the desk
 I'm searching high and low
 But I don't see anyone
 Don't see anyone
 Don't see anyone there
 
 Impatiently I wait to refill my prescription
 And count the tock of the drugstore clock
 A prototype they say to combat my affliction
 Extra gravity to control me
 But that's my fun and I like fun
 
 And so do you
 As we float away
 So do you
 As we float away
 
 My excellence at parkour
 Is not to be discounted
 As I leap away and disappear
 My excellence at parkour might be unexpected
 At the age of 58 it comes as quite a surprise
 
 But not to you
 We float away
 Not to you
 As we float away

 I saw the best minds of my generation
 Destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical
 I should be allowed to glue my poster
 I should be allowed to think
 
 I should be allowed to glue my poster
 I should be allowed to think
 I should be allowed to think
 I should be allowed to think
 And I should be allowed to blurt the merest idea
 If by random whim, one occurs to me
 If necessary, leave paper stains on the gray utility pole
 
 I saw the worst bands of my generation
 Applied by magic marker to dry wall
 I should be allowed to shoot my mouth off
 I should have a call in show
 
 I should be allowed to glue my poster
 I should be allowed to think
 I should be allowed to think
 I should be allowed to think
 And I should be allowed to blurt the merest idea
 If by random whim, one occurs to me
 If necessary, leave paper stains on the gray utility pole
 
 I am not allowed
 To ever come up with a single original thought
 I am not allowed
 To meet the criminal government agent who oppresses me
 
 I was the worst hope of my generation
 Destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical
 I should be allowed to share my feelings
 I should be allowed to feel
 
 I should be allowed to glue my poster
 I should be allowed to think
 I should be allowed to think

 I'll sink Manhattan
 Right under the sea
 I'll find the sweetest spot to watch
 As it goes away
 
 You were so happy
 With the things that you said
 Like, "He's my lower half," you laughed
 But you're going to cry
 
 A river of tiny tears flow from your crocodile eyes
 Too late to apologize, I say, as flood waters rise
 
 I'll sink Manhattan
 I'll sacrifice friends
 I think they'd understand my plan
 I'll never be sure
 
 I've got a message
 So before I get through
 I'll find your answering machine
 And I'll sink it first
 
 Burn your forget-me-nots
 Admit that true love can die
 No, I won't apologize, my love, just kiss me goodbye
 
 I'm a coward
 It's a miracle I dare breathe
 Overpowered by the gentlest summer breeze
 Even when I close my eyes
 I like to think that I'm hiding
 
 I need a confidant
 A co-conspirator
 To turn the tide
 On my losing side
 
 I'm a coward
 Guess I'd best make myself clear
 I bet mumbles
 Are what you'd expect to hear
 
 I need a confidant
 Who can see past my faults
 And take the time
 To save me from myself
 
 I need a confidant
 A co-conspirator
 To turn the tide
 On my losing side

 Do you recall someone you haven't thought about in a long time?
 That one with a tiny face is he now on your mind
 
 I was never much in your life
 But now you can only think of me
 When you're concentrating on someone else
 You can only think of me
 Your attention wanders when you're trying to read
 You can only think of me
 
 You can
 Only
 Think of
 Me you
 Can only think of me
 
 I pronounce these words with unbearable precision
 You can only think of me
 Your apparent nonchalance belies the fact
 That you can only think of me
 
 You can
 
 Only
 
 Think of
 
 Me you
 
 Can  only  think of  me
 
 Everywhere you look
 Everything you smell
 Every song you hear reminds you of me as well

 Why don't you leave a message
 
 Never thought I'd fall,
 But now I hear love call,
 I'm getting sentimental over you
 
 Things you say and do,
 Just thrill me through and through,
 I'm getting sentimental over you.
 
 I thought I was happy,
 I could live without love
 Now I must admit,
 Love is all I'm thinking of
 
 Won't you please be kind,
 And just make up your mind
 That you'll be sweet & gentle,
 Be gentle with me
 Because I'm sentimental over you

 When that gorilla beats his chest
 I fall to bits
 I confess
 I admit; I'm impressed
 When the torpedo in the vest barks his orders

 And I find that my head's nodding yes
 Though my legs are not following
 I'm inspired by events
 To remember the exits in back of me
 
 I'm impressed, I'm impressed
 When that gorilla pounds his desk
 I fall to bits
 I confess
 I admit; I'm impressed
 Through generalissimo's request
 I can't help but feel impressed
 
 On the one hand he'll give you five good reasons to follow him
 On the other hand you see nobody leaving the stadium
 
 I'm impressed, I'm impressed
 By that Godzilla's flaming breath
 I fall to bits

 Screw kid I got nothing to say
 Quit bugging me, go away
 High time you realized
 I didn't come here to socialize
 
 I'm sick, sick of this American life
 And I've learned the value of human sacrifice
 
 I like staring at two glass eyes
 Keep them stuffed, museum style
 Got alarms set all around
 In case they move around
 
 I'm sick, sick of this American life
 And I've learned the value of human sacrifice
 
 Early one day
 I got up the strength
 To call you on the phone
 You answered and said
 "Please leave a mess-"
 And I dropped the receiver then
 
 I'll do as you ask if I can figure out where you live
 And though the world may think you strange
 I find you great
 
 Just for your information
 If you should hear this
 I am letting you know that
 I'm your boyfriend now
 
 I read your book
 But then it took
 A year to find your house
 I was nervous at first
 And then it got worse
 When there was no turning 'round
 
 If you don't know by now just look I'm
 Right outside
 You've got to admit that
 I'm your boyfriend now
 
 Your boyfriend now
 Is fond of long walks on the beach at night
 Your boyfriend likes
 Italian food and wine
 
 Your boyfriend wants
 To meet someone who shares his interests
 In listening
 To voices in my head
 
 You don't have to say it
 I can see it in your eyes
 I can read it in your heart
 I can hear it in your silence
 
 Just for your information if you should
 Get this letter
 Here's a reminder
 I'm your boyfriend now
 
 I don't need you to tell me the things
 I know are true but
 Can't you admit that
 I'm your boyfriend now?
 Why don't you act like
 I'm your boyfriend now?
 Don't deny it
 I'm your boyfriend now

 Love people are there
 The smell of love is everywhere
 You think it's always sensitive and good
 You think that I want to be understood
 I've got a match
 Your embrace and my collapse
 
 Beat up the cat if you need someone else on the mat
 I put a rock in the coffee in your coffee mug
 Which one of us is the one that we can't trust?
 You say that I think it's you but I don't agree with that

 Even at my best I am dismantling my chances
 Even as I win a bunch I got trip wires to finesse
 I'm a mess
 I ain't right
 If there's a test tonight I will ask for an extension
 As I slide my desk a bit toward the kind man dressed in white
 I ain't right
 
 In fact it's messier still
 That mess is a hook that drags me along
 And now the mess has an entourage
 All dressed in dungarees
 What went wrong
 
 I confess and like a chess piece yes
 I've rolled under the your piano
 That you don't play a lot but I'm sorry I digress
 I'm a mess
 Let me out
 Don't want to be your mouse
 I want to find a softer spot for my crash landing
 Not much to talk about
 Let me out
 
 In fact it's messier still
 That mess on the loose and leading a mob
 They march with pitchforks and torches now
 They have your old ID disavow

 Most with cones for seeds, most with needles for leaves
 C is for conifers, my kind of trees
 Large junipers and fir, spruce, cedars and pines
 C is for conifers, more then five hundred kinds
 If you see a Christmas tree or a stack of newspapers or a 2x4 frame of a house
 It's probably made from pine trees and pine trees are conifers, that's what this song is about
 Or if you see a plant in the shape of an elephant, or in the shape of a dog
 It's probably a shrub, a conifer shrub pruned into that shape by someone
 Most with cones for seeds, most with needles for leaves
 C is for conifers, my kind of trees
 Large junipers and fir, spruce, cedars and pines
 C is for conifers, more then five hundred kinds
 
 Spoken: There are so many different kinds of conifer trees.
 This is just a few of them: Spruce,
 Hemlocks, larch, cyprus, juniper,
 Fir, Douglas fir, cedar, yew,
 Pine, the dwarf conifer,
 And the great California sequoia redwood.

 Istanbul was Constantinople
 Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople
 Been a long time gone, Constantinople
 Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night
 
 Every gal in Constantinople
 Lives in Istanbul, not Constantinople
 So if you've a date in Constantinople
 She'll be waiting in Istanbul
 
 Even old New York was once New Amsterdam
 Why they changed it I can't say
 People just liked it better that way
 
 So take me back to Constantinople
 No, you can't go back to Constantinople
 Been a long time gone, Constantinople
 Why did Constantinople get the works?
 That's nobody's business but the Turks

 It's kickin' in, yeah! It's kickin' in, yeah!
 It's kickin' in, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
 
 Shocked awake in the middle of the day
 In a fight over shadows of the night
 And you wonder why the talk is so bold
 When it's boring and the story's so old
 
 Panic call to her best friend on the phone
 Won't sit down but she just can't sit alone
 Hard to justify a party band
 To somebody with no party plans
 
 Stop to appreciate it
 Let's hear the boyfriends say it
 
 It's kickin' in, yeah! It's kickin' in, yeah!
 It's kickin' in, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
 
 Going good up until we shut 'em down
 Bum a ride to the other side of town
 In a restaurant with so much class
 If we'd stop laughing we could almost pass
 
 The disaffected waitress
 In some fake foreign accent:
 
 Well the rain falls down without my help I'm afraid
 And my lawn gets wet though I've withheld my consent
 When this grey world crumbles like a cake
 I'll be hanging from the hope
 That I'll never see that recipe again
 
 As I walk, I think about a new way to walk
 As I think, I'm using up the time left to think
 And this train keep rolling off the track
 Trying to act like something else
 Trying to go where it's been uninvited
 
 It's not my birthday
 It's not today
 It's not my birthday, so why do you lunge out at me?
 When the word comes down, "Never more will be around"
 Though I'll wish you were there, I was less than we could bear
 And I'm not the only dust my mother raised
 
 So, I'm rattling the bars around this drink tank
 Discreetly I should pour through the keyhole or evaporate completely
 But there'd be no percentage, and there'd be no proof
 And the sound upon the roof is only water
 
 And the rain falls down without my help I'm afraid
 And my lawn gets wet though I've withheld my consent
 When this grey world crumbles like a cake
 I'll be hanging from the hope
 That I'll never see that recipe again
 
 It's not my birthday
 It's not today
 It's not my birthday, so why do you lunge out at me?
 When the word comes down, "Never more will be around"
 Though I'll wish you were there, I was less than we could bear
 And I'm not the only dust my mother raised
 I am not the only dust my mother raised
 
 In 1844, the Democrats were split
 The three nominees for the presidential candidate
 Were Martin Van Buren, a former president and an abolitionist
 James Buchanan, a moderate
 Louis Cass, a general and expansionist
 From Nashville came a dark horse riding up
 He was James K. Polk, Napoleon of the Stump
 
 Austere, severe, he held few people dear
 His oratory filled his foes with fear
 The factions soon agreed
 He's just the man we need
 To bring about victory
 Fulfill our manifest destiny
 And annex the land the Mexicans command
 And when the votes were cast the winner was
 Mister James K. Polk, Napoleon of the Stump
 
 In four short years he met his every goal
 He seized the whole southwest from Mexico
 Made sure the tariffs fell
 And made the English sell the Oregon territory
 He built an independent treasury
 Having done all this he sought no second term
 But precious few have mourned the passing of
 Mister James K. Polk, our eleventh president
 Young Hickory, Napoleon of the Stump
 
 Flans, When I was 39 years old, I heard a story. 
 I found out that there  people walking among us who have superpowers. 
 These people are called Supertasters. 
 To a Supertaster, bitter fruits taste far more bitter, and sweets far more sweet. 
 Then, just a few months ago, I had the chance to meet a real, live 
 Supertaster named John Lee.
 And this is his true story,
 Nothing tastes the same 
 To a Supertaster 
 When he tastes a pear 
 It's like a hundred pears 
 
 He's got superpowers 
 He is a Supertaster 
 Every flavor explodes 
 Explodes and explodes
 
 John Lee Supertaster 
 Tastes more than we do
 Everything has a flavor
 Some flavors are too much
 
 Can't shut his mouth 
 'Cause he's a Supertaster 
 Though he looks like a man 
 He is a Supertaster 
 
 Can't drink coffee or beer 
 Cause he's a Supertaster 
 Loves ice cream and pie 
 He is a Supertaster 
 
 John Lee Supertaster
 Tastes more than we know
 Everything has a flavor
 Some flavors must go
 
 You met Judy in the 90s
 She threw parties for magazines
 For a while she had a roommate
 But the roommate was never seen
 
 Who knew she could be so reckless
 Who knew you could be so wrong
 Dancing in her kitchen for so long
 
 Ten years on and something's shifted
 Same apartment roommate's gone
 Putting down the torch you lifted
 Back to portraits poorly drawn
 
 Judy lies but you believe her
 She's the storm before the calm
 Judy is the great deceiver
 Judy is your Viet Nam
 
 Judy is your Viet Nam
 
 I built a little empire out of some crazy garbage
 Called the blood of the exploited working class
 But they've overcome their shyness
 Now they're calling me Your Highness
 And a world screams, "Kiss me, Son of God"
 
 I destroyed a bond of friendship and respect
 Between the only people left who'd even look me in the eye
 Now I laugh and make a fortune
 Off the same ones that I tortured
 And a world screams, "Kiss me, Son of God"
 
 I look like Jesus, so they say
 But Mr. Jesus is very far away
 Now you're the only one here who can tell me if it's true
 That you love me and I love me
 
 I built a little empire out of some crazy garbage
 Called the blood of the exploited working class
 But they've overcome their shyness
 Now they're calling me Your Highness
 And a world screams, "Kiss me, Son of God"
 Yes a world screams, "Kiss me, Son of God"
 
 
 Hello children, it's time for an important lesson with Professor Flans.

 Lake monsters of the USA
 From Cape Cod, to Massachusetts
 All across America
 From Chicago to East California
 
 You might be asking yourself
 Is this a different world?
 Are they really there?
 Thank your lucky stars
 
 Lake monsters of the USA
 Just looking for a polling station
 If it takes the cloak of darkness
 Their voices will be counted
 
 You might be asking yourself
 What happened to this world?
 But they're not ashamed
 They cannot be tamed

 Saw that in a movie
 I just fixed up the cellar
 Half of that is mine
 Some of that was true
 We die alone we die afraid
 We live in terror we're naked and alone
 And the grave is the loneliest place
 We die alone we die afraid
 We live in terror we're naked and alone
 And the grave is the loneliest place
 
 We die alone we die afraid
 We live in terror we're naked and alone
 Naked and alone

 Last wave rolling by
 Final wave don't ask why 
 There goes a wave rolling by
 Last wave
 
 I'm so tired of wating
 My heart is cold
 The sky is dark
 I'm curled up in the ashes
 
 We die alone we die afraid
 We live in terror we're naked and alone
 We die
 
 If you want to make out with a biplane 
 Perchance a dance with a carcass in space 
 And now you got to buy me some antlers
 Antlers are what I need you to buy
 
 To take me down to the postman
 
 Tell the postman to throw them to
 
 Wave rolling by
 Final wave don't ask why
 There goes a wave rolling by

 Lazy Head and Sleepy Bones
 Always disagree
 Though everybody says they should be friends
 They're too tired to see
 
 When Sleepy Bones says he's feeling tired
 Lazy Head wants to rest
 When Lazy Head says it's "number one"
 Sleepy Bones says it's "best"
 
 When Lazy Head uses imagination
 Sleepy Bones daydreams
 Sleepy Bones says, "It's not what it looks like"
 And Lazy Head says, "It's not what it seems"

 Always disagree
 Though everybody says they should be friends

 When Lazy Head says somebody's "skinny"
 Sleepy Bones says "thin"
 When Sleepy Bones says "identical"
 Lazy Head says "twin"
 
 When Lazy Head says the window is "closed"
 Sleepy Bones says it's "shut"
 When Sleepy Bones says that something "isn't"
 Lazy Head says, "It's not"

 Both take naps so long
 And even though they should be friends
 They can't get along

 Oh, let me tell you all about my operation
 
 Smile wide, scrub side, feet on the dash
 I'll sleep the whole damn day
 Slow lane, propane, empties for cash
 Rear-view mirror thrown away
 
 Oh, let me tell you about my operation
 Doctors removed your memory 
 
 Ground floor, screen door, yelling inside
 I think you know the scene
 Front lawn, break of dawn, clothes on the ground
 How could you be so mean?
 
 Oh, let me tell you about my operation
 Doctors removed your memory 
 Oh, it's good news; it's just a quick procedure
 Find happiness through surgery
 
 Oh, let me tell you about my operation
 Doctors declared I'm better now
 Our liaison'oh, it was poison, baby!
 Our liaison'it was a drag
 
 Let me tell you about my operation
 Doctors removed your memory 
 Oh, it's good news; it's just a quick procedure
 Find happiness through surgery

 Let your hair hang down
 It is now the time
 To untie your hair
 Let your hair hang down
 
 Why do we resemble concrete
 Did you order all the storm clouds
 Who overturned the party cart
 Who said to stomp the fire out
 
 Let the wrong be wrong
 Would it be so bad
 When your hair's so long
 Let your hair hang down
 
 Do we have to drag the drag around is that the plan
 Could we leave the barking dogs and join the caravan
 
 Let your hair hang down
 It is now the time
 To untie your hair
 Let your hair hang down
 
 Without a written guarantee of perfect sailing
 Can you crawl from under the porch without a helmet
 Before we can get all the facts
 We may be going to have to act
 
 Let the wrong be wrong
 Would it be so bad
 When your hair's so long
 When you look so sad
 Let your hair hang down
 It is now the time
 To untie your hair
 Let your hair hang down
 
 The drumbeat never changes tempo
 It's steady like a rock
 And like a rock it crushes you as it gets louder
 The drum gets louder and louder
 And you know there is no parking on the dance floor
 
 And when you wake up you can feel your hair grow
 Crawl out of your cave and you can watch your shadow
 Creep across the ground until the day is done
 All the while the planet circles 'round the sun
 Everybody knows how this goes so let's get over it
 And let's get this over with
 
 Even when you're out of work you still have a job to do
 Even when you don't know what it is
 Your job knows what it is
 What it is is it's coming to get you
 I'm talking to myself even when I'm saying "you"
 
 And when you wake up you can feel your hair grow
 Crawl out of your cave and you can watch your shadow
 Creep across the ground until the day is done
 All the while the planet circles 'round the sun
 Everybody knows how this goes so let's get over it
 And let's get this over with
 
 After all the spelling mistakes
 After all the groping in the dark
 Can this page of strange gibberish
 Get a final punctuation mark?
 
 You're still hanging around the clambake
 After every clam has been baked
 No applause
 Awkward pause
 Hand extended waiting for a shake
 
 And when you wake up you can feel your hair grow
 Crawl out of your cave and you can watch your shadow
 Creep across the ground until the day is done
 All the while the planet circles 'round the sun
 Everybody knows how this goes so let's get over it
 And let's get this over with
 
 Hurry up and let's get this over with
 You don't have to go home but you can't stay here
 Everybody knows how this goes so let's get over it
 And let's get this over with
 
 What's that?
 That is a letter
 What is that?
 That's not a letter
 
 That's a letter
 That's not a letter
 That is a letter
 
 Is that a letter?
 I don't know what that is
 That's so a letter
 What is that?
 
 Whatever that is, it's not a letter
 That's a letter
 Is that a letter, or what?
 That's a letter
 Only it's upside down
 
 I'll never know what you'll find
 When you open up your letter box tomorrow
 'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know, 
 She's my best friend, she's a sparrow
 And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know 
 When you know what you are, O.
 
 If I had a pair of eyes on the back of my head for each time
 You forgot to take out all the things you forgot to talk about 
 When you took a bite out of my spine,
 I would have a lot of eyes on me by this time wouldn't I? 
 Wouldn't that just be fine.
 
 Too late or soon to make noise about
 Love and there's no time for sorrow
 Run around in the rain with a hole in the brain till tomorrow
 
 I'll never know what you'll find 
 When you open up your letter box tomorrow
 'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know, 
 She's my best friend, she's a sparrow
 And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know 
 When you know what you are, O.
 
 Lie still, little bottle, and shake my shaky hand
 Black coffee's not enough for me, I need a better friend
 One pill at the bottom is singing my favorite song
 I know I must investigate
 I hope that I can sing along
 
 There's no time for metaphors cried the little pill to me
 He said, "Life is a placebo masquerading as a simile"
 Well, I knew that pill was lying
 Too gregarious, too nice
 But as he walked I had to sing this twice
 
 Lie still, little bottle
 Don't twist, it ain't twistin' time
 With every move you make you just disintegrate my ever-troubled mind
 
 Lie still, little bottle, and shake my shaky hand
 Black coffee's not enough for me, I need a better friend
 One pill at the bottom is singing my favorite song
 I know I must investigate
 I hope that I can sing along
 
 Lie still, little bottle
 Lie still
 Lie still, little bottle
 Lie still
 Lie still
 Lie still
 
 Lost my mind
 Left somewhere behind
 Must've been in amongst
 The things we'd thrown out
 
 Nowhere to be found
 Probably buried underground
 I could try to dig it up
 But I don't want to waste my time
 
 To summarize, this whole planet is elliptical
 In short, I am both the bag and the boxing glove
 So I'll apply this wet transfer tattoo showing
 A finger pointing at the other one that says I
 
 Lost my mind
 Left somewhere behind
 I must have put it in amongst
 The things we'd thrown out
 
 Nowhere to be found
 Probably buried underground
 I could try to dig it up
 But I don't want to waste my time
 
 Floating down a lazy river is my mind
 Circling an unknown baggage carousel is also my mind
 
 Do you ever even think of me?
 Though I am always thinking of you
 You're the last thing out there now
 That somewhere out there
 
 You lost the herd
 Separated at birth
 Shed around some visages
 With intelligent remarks
 
 Lost my mind
 Left somewhere behind
 I could try to dig it up
 But I don't know where
 Because I lost my mind
 
 Lost my mind
 The one I left behind
 Nowhere to be found
 Probably buried underground
 And I must dig it up
 But I don't know how
 I died of time
 
 
 Have you ever seen a bloody egg?
 Glass in hand, lying up in bed
 That's the time to sing this cowardly lullaby
 And you ought to know why
 
 Lullaby to nightmares, whispered low
 In the night where bat wings flow
 That's where all the frightmares go
 When the elephants die
 Wouldn't you like to try?
 
 Have you ever heard the blackbird's song?
 Summer days, all summer long
 Underneath a shady tree a shadow sitting next to me
 And we stare at the sun
 
 Lullaby to nightmares, whispered low
 In the night where bat wings flow
 That's where all the frightmares go
 When the elephants die
 Wouldn't you like to try?
 
 I am a man of honor
 And I am mortified by your litany of slurs
 Such a lot of words
 Oh, dear
 
 Madam, I challenge you to a duel
 My second warned you to be careful
 That bell can't be unrung
 Madam, you mistake me for a bumpkin
 It's clear you're yelling something
 Oh please, don't burst a lung
 
 You are an unfit rival
 By spirits taught to sing
 But a tune so twisted now
 Like all that's sweet's gone sour
 Oh, dear
 
 Madam, you mistake me for a fool
 Yes, your little dog may hold the pistols
 Although he seems high-strung
 
 Madam, I challenge you to a duel
 My second warned you to be careful
 That bell can't be unrung
 Can't be unrung
 Can't be unrung
 
 Can I have this last dance, my darling?
 Can I have this last dance with you?
 I want to dance the whole night tonight
 And can I have this last dance, my darling?
 Can I have this last dance with you?
 These are the words that he told to the fellow next door
 
 Mainstream, U.S.A.
 I flipped that guy the bird
 Mainstream, U.S.A.

 Standing in between extinction in the cold
 And explosive radiating growth
 So the warm blood flows
 Through the large four-chambered heart
 Maintaining the very high metabolism rate they have
 
 Mammal, mammal
 Their names are called
 They raise a paw
 The bat, the cat
 Dolphin and dog
 Koala bear and hog
 
 One of us might lose his hair
 But you're reminded that it once was there
 From the embryonic whale to the monkey with no tail
 So the warm blood flows
 With the red blood cells lacking nuclei
 Through the large four-chambered heart
 Maintaining the very high metabolism rate they have
 
 Mammal, mammal
 Their names are called
 They raise a paw
 The bat, the cat
 Dolphin and dog
 Koala bear and hog
 
 Placental the sister of her brother Marsupial
 Their cousin called Monotreme
 Dead uncle Allotheria
 
 Mammal, mammal
 Their names are called
 They raise a paw
 The bat, the cat
 Dolphin and dog
 Koala bear and hog
 The fox, the ox
 Giraffe and shrew
 Echidna, caribou
 
 They fixed up the corner store like it was a nightclub
 It's permanently disco
 Everyone is dressed so oddly
 I can't recognize them
 I can't tell the staff from the customers
 
 Baby, check this out
 I've got something to say
 Man, it's so loud in here
 When they stop the drum machine and I can think again
 
 I'll remember what it was
 You have to carry all your things
 You can't misplace them
 There's nowhere to place anything
 Baby, check this out
 I've got something to say
 Man, it's so loud in here
 When they stop the drum machine and I can think again
 
 I'll remember what it was
 They're all shouting something at us waving and pointing
 They've revamped the airport completely now it looks 
 Just like a nightclub everyone's excited and confused
 
 Baby, check this out
 I've got something to say
 Man, it's so loud in here
 When they start the love machine and I can love again
 I'll remember what it was
 
 I'm steaming up the inside
 Of my Marty Beller mask
 'Cause I'm really Whitney Houston
 On the drums
 
 It's been 15 long years
 Since I put on the Marty mask
 You're the only person
 That I've ever told
 
 Don't walk away from me
 I will always love you
 But how will I know?
 Trick or treat?
 
 I can see you through the eye holes
 Of my Marty Beller mask
 But I'm really Whitney Houston
 On the drums
 
 I was disenchanted
 Stardom was so fake
 That's when I got back
 Into the drums
 
 Marty was convenient
 A vessel for my dream
 I knew exactly
 How to fill his shoes
 
 Don't walk away from me
 I will always love you
 But how will I know?
 Trick or treat?
 
 I can see you through the eye holes
 Of my Marty Beller mask
 But I'm really Whitney Houston
 On the drums
 
 Marty gets the mansion
 And I get his skins
 
 Don't walk away from me
 I will always love you
 But how will I know?
 Trick or treat?
 I am steaming up the inside
 Of my Marty Beller mask
 'Cause I'm really Whitney Houston
 On the drums
 Look again, this isn't Marty
 On the drums
 I am really Whitney Houston
 
 
 If only there were some way to shut out
 All this noise in my head
 Oh wait there already is
 It's called McCafferty's Bib
 
 I used to have eleven problems
 Then they all went away
 When I added one more
 Called McCafferty's Bib
 
 Now the gray, gray clouds
 Have arrived and the gray, gray clouds
 Have decided to stay with us from now on
 
 I ate the whole bottle of pills
 And wondered what I had swallowed
 And I saw that
 The label Said McCafferty's Bib
 
 And then all the scenery melted away
 And in back of it
 The only thing left
 Was McCafferty's Bib
 
 And the gray, gray clouds
 Have arrived and the gray, gray clouds
 Have decided to stay with us from now on
 
 In cities all over the world
 All the people are suddenly struck
 By the same idea
 
 They're massing in public squares
 And they're singing a note
 That rises from low to high
 
 With one hand they're holding up
 Signs of Bob Hope, in the other
 Hand, everyone's
 Waving McCafferty's Bib
 
 The toothpaste won't go back in the bottle
 Since it granted our wish
 And we will never be rid
 Of McCafferty's Bib
 
 Meet James Ensor
 Belgium's famous painter
 Dig him up and shake his hand
 Appreciate the man
 
 Before there were junk stores
 Before there was junk
 He lived with his mother and the torments of Christ
 The world was transformed
 A crowd gathered round
 Pressed against his window so they could be the first
 
 To meet James Ensor
 Belgium's famous painter
 Raise a glass and sit and stare
 Understand the man
 
 He lost all his friends
 He didn't need his friends
 He lived with his mother and repeated himself
 The world has forgotten
 The world moved along
 The crowd at his window went back to their homes
 
 Meet James Ensor
 Meet James Ensor
 Belgium's famous painter

 Iron is a metal, you see it every day
 Oxygen, eventually, will make it rust away
 Carbon in its ordinary form is coal
 Crush it together, and diamonds are born
 
 Come on come on and meet the elements
 May I introduce you to our friends, the elements?
 Like a box of paints that are mixed to make every shade
 They either combine to make a chemical compound or stand alone as they are
 
 Neon's a gas that lights up the sign for a pizza place
 The coins that you pay with are copper, nickel, and zinc
 Silicon and oxygen make concrete bricks and glass
 Now add some gold and silver for some pizza place class
 
 Come on come on and meet the elements
 I think you should check out the ones they call the elements
 Like a box of paints that are mixed to make every shade
 They either combine to make a chemical compound or stand alone as they are
 
 Team up with other elements making compounds when they combine
 Or make up a simple element formed out of atoms of the one kind
 
 Balloons are full of helium, and so is every star
 Stars are mostly hydrogen, which may someday fill your car
 
 Hey, who let in all these elephants?
 Did you know that elephants are made of elements?
 Elephants are mostly made of four elements
 And every living thing is mostly made of four elements
 Plants, bugs, birds, fish, bacteria and men
 Are mostly carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen
 
 Come on come on and meet the elements
 You and I are complicated, but we're made of elements
 Like a box of paints that are mixed to make every shade
 They either combine to make a chemical compound or stand alone as they are
 
 Team up with other elements making compounds when they combine
 Or make up a simple element formed out of atoms of the one kind
 
 Come on come on and meet the elements
 Check out the ones they call the elements
 Like a box of paints that are mixed to make every shade
 They either combine to make a chemical compound or stand alone as they are
 
 I'll be in the back, and I don't need the help
 I'm good here in the back
 I'm good all by myself
 I'm busy taking stock of all the things that I've forgot 
 And making mental notes of just exactly where I lost the plot 
 
 I stuck around too long feeling sorry for myself
 A disinvited guest rifles through the bathroom shelf
 I'm searching for some disbelief that I can still suspend 
 But never mind the furthermore-the plea is self-defense again 
 
 Then the people came to talk me down
 And I got some advice
 Then the people came to talk me down
 But I don't need advice-I'm down
 
 Later in my car I considered what you said
 I'm good here in my car
 I'm good with what you said
 And I'd be shouting out to you but I was mighty hoarse
 Talk you through the finer points and issues much too small to force
 
 Then the people came to talk me down
 And I got some advice
 Then the people came to talk me down
 But I don't need advice-I'm down
 
 Down at the shore there's a place where there's no one vacationing
 There's just the sound of the call of the wild overcoming the fear of the unknown
 
 And I've got something to help you understand
 Something waiting there beneath the sand
 My metal detector
 Is with me all of the time
 
 I'm the inspector over the mine
 
 Look past the volleyball 
 Look past the squawking gull 
 Ignore the mountain of discarded falderal
 
 'Cause I've got something to make you understand
 Something hidden there underneath the land
 My metal detector
 Is with me all of the time
 
 I'm the inspector over the mine
 Metal detector, watch it shine
 
 Every seashell has a story to tell if you're listening
 But underneath every shell there's a story as well if you've heard enough of the sea
 Then everything on the top will just suddenly stop seeming interesting
 So listen now to the sound of the things that are found underground
 
 Don't need no volleyball 
 Don't need no squawking gull 
 Don't need to look at any bathing beauty doll 
 
 For I've got something to help you understand
 Something waiting there beneath the sand
 My metal detector
 Is with me all of the time
 
 I'm the inspector over the mine
 
 Look past the volleyball 
 Look past the squawking gull 
 Ignore the mountain of discarded falderal
 
 'Cause I've got something to make you understand
 Something hidden there underneath the land
 My metal detector
 Is with me all of the time
 
 I'm the inspector over the mine
 Metal detector, watch it shine
 
 Don't need no volleyball 
 Don't need no squawking gull 
 Metal detector, all the time

 Hit by a Mink Car
 Driven by a Guitar
 And the silver Chauffeur says
 That it's all in your head

 Dead

 She is reaching past my hollow form
 And her smile's
 An open sign in an abandoned store

 While they were staring at the Citgo sign
 Is when they lost our trail
 They thought we were part of a caravan
 But we had other plans
 You can't catch me, where I'm gonna fall
 You can't catch me, where I'll hide
 This world's too cold,
 So I'm gonna roam,
 I'm moving to the sun
 93 miles times a million more
 Quite a trip we've planned
 I must drive now carefully
 And figure where we'll land
 You can't catch me, where I'm gonna fall
 You can't catch me, where I'll hide
 This world's too cold,
 So I'm gonna roam
 I'm moving to the sun
 
 A claw is a claw
 And, and, and nobody has seen a, a talking claw
 Nobody has seen a talking claw

 Unless that claw is the famous

 Once a boy named Mister Me bemoaned a great regret
 I've floundered in the misty sea, but can't abide its mystery
 I wound up sad, you bet
 
 So onward go and Edward Ho into the bounding main
 Enjoy the show look out below but mind the misty sea
 Or end up sad like Mister Me
 
 He ended up sad
 He ended up sad
 He ended up really, really, really sad
 He ended up sad
 He ended up sad
 He ended up really, really, really sad
 
 So take the hand of Mister Me and mister, make him glad
 To swim the Mister Misty Sea and cease the Mister Mystery
 That mister, made him sad
 
 He ended up sad
 He ended up sad
 He ended up really, really, really sad
 He ended up sad
 He ended up sad
 He ended up really, really, really sad
 
 He ended up sad
 He ended up sad
 He ended up really, really, really sad
 He ended up sad
 He ended up sad
 He ended up really, really, really sad
 
 Cafe con pan, cafe con pan,
 Rock on my hubba, the beat is blubba
 Being stingy on the pike collect the one into the otha
 Careen in tandem, the sea into the landem
 The people in the pix they want to scarf and dig the clamdem
 
 Aww yes! Mr Excitement!
 We nix the glaben, the knifey-knife is staben
 Protrude into the hoobalicious scoff the extra aden
 I write the mooky, my verse is extra spooky
 Like Flansy in a soda can, it's trooky-trooky-trooky
 
 Aww yes! Mr Excitement!
 
 I want to say I learned something valuable today
 Alas, my murdered remains are incapable of learning anything
 Trusted you
 I should have never trusted you
 In fact I never did
 What's the use
 I'm not complaining
 I'm not anything
 
 Is this what's supposed to happen
 When you're only trying to do right in this wicked world?
 Probably I should already know this
 Probably I should graciously accept what I get
 
 Most people wouldn't hang the corpses up for review
 Dearest, I can only hope most people are nothing like you
 Nervous tics
 That I pretended not to see
 That's how I was brought up
 Warning signs
 Death metal albums
 "Hang in there, baby" poster
 
 Is this how you thank somebody
 For their selfless loyalty? Is this what you do?
 Pardon me for failing to grasp how this works
 Excuse my breathtaking ignorance
 
 Is this what's supposed to happen
 When you're only trying to do right in this wicked world?
 Probably I should already know this
 Probably I should graciously accept what I get
 
 I don't want to be first in line to see Mrs. Train
 I expect that it doesn't matter to Mrs. Train
 Being comfortable with yourself
 And being patient and taking your time
 
 Are the things that Mrs. Train can understand
 I've never seen a train like this before
 But then again there's never been
 A train like this before like Mrs. Train
 
 And someone's got to be the one to declare
 That they want to be next in line to see Mrs. Train
 But I don't want to be first in line to see Mrs. Train
 I expect that it doesn't matter to Mrs. Train
 
 Being patient and taking your time
 Are things a train can understand
 And I'll be happy when I finally take her hand
 There's never been a train like this before.
 
 Someone's got to be the one
 At the head of the line to first see Mrs. Train.
 But I'm not in any rush to head the line
 And so the line has a missing head.
 
 And I don't want to be first in line to see the missing head
 I expect that it doesn't matter to the missing head
 Being patient and taking your time
 Are things that a head can understand
 
 And I'll be happy when I finally take its hand
 There's never been a head like this before
 Someone's got to be the one
 At the head of the line to first see the missing head
 
 But I'm not in any rush to head the line
 And so the line has a missing head
 
  And I don't want to be first in line to see the missing head
  I expect that it doesn't matter to the missing head
 Being patient and taking your time
 Are things that a head can understand
 And I'll be happy when I finally take its hand
 
 They built this whole neighborhood out of wood, out of wood.
 I guess I'll still be around when they burn, burn it down.
 I will be standing around when they burn it down.
 Here in the Museum of Idiots.
 
 Honey, I'm there when you need me, please believe me, please believe me.
 I'll still be right where you left me, if you manage to forget me.
 Where we met is where you may forget.
 Here in the Museum of Idiots.
 
 If you and I had any brains, we wouldn't be in this place.
 
 Chop me up into pieces if it pleases, if it pleases.
 And when the chopping is through, every piece will say, "I love you."
 Every piece of me will say "I love you."
 Here in the Museum of Idiots.
 
 Every piece of me will say "I love you, you you"
 Here in the Museum of Idiots.
 
 Where you going, buddy?
 Where you going, buddy?
 Where you going, buddy?
 Where you going, buddy?
 Won't you come with me to music jail?
 
 Where you going, darling?
 Where you going, darling?
 Where you going, darling?
 Where you going, darling?
 Won't you come with me to music jail?
 
 Let's form a band
 Let's take a stand
 
 Where you going, fella?
 Where you going, fella?
 Where you going, fella?
 Where you going, fella?
 Won't you come with me to music jail?
 
 Don't turn away
 Why don't you stay?
 
 I was not prepared
 To do time, to do time
 Frankly, I was scared
 About time, about time
 
 I was in a cloud
 Everything so loud
 Life's a riot
 No one's quiet at all
 
 In this music crowd
 I'm alone, I'm alone
 Just one call allowed
 No one's home, no one's home
 
 I am getting pale
 Who could post my bail?
 Done believing
 Dreams of leaving are gone
 
 My evil twin, bad weather friend
 He always wants to start when I want to begin
 It scares me so, like I scare myself
 With that book of Nostradamus up upon my shelf
 
 Playing hangman 'til the morning light
 Doing donuts on the neighbors lawn
 Then sleep all through the day, get up and start again
 I can hear some sirens somewhere but I don't know why
 
 My evil twin runs home again
 Search lights look for an alibi, but I'll be home by then
 
 Here he comes again, my evil twin
 My friends have seen him hiding underneath my skin
 
 Who cut the arm off the voodoo doll
 That resembles a Republican president from long ago
 I'd hate to see you leave
 'Cause I have grown so grateful for the
 Blame you save me from
 
 My twin
 My twin
 My twin
 
  I know he looks like me
  Hates work like me and walks like me
  He's even got a twin like me
 
 My evil twin, bad weather friend
 I know some day I'll meet him
 But I don't know where or when
 
 My man
 Muscles from hand to foot
 Completely coated in uninterrupted skin
 
 My man
 Signals command the leg
 To follow orders coming down from headquarters
 Why then am I in bed?
 I guess my man's fallen out with my head
 May I direct your attention to the following simile
 You're like the coasts of an ocean
 Buried beneath is a submarine cable
 Connecting the opposite shores that surround it
 
 My man
 How can he stand?
 Your fingers could encircle clear around the ankle
 My man won't walk again
 In conflict with express instructions given by the brain
 Why can't the message be sent?
 I guess my man's fallen out with my head
 When something happens to drag on the floor of the ocean
 For instance an anchor or mooring
 The cable can be disrupted and even be severed
 Which halts the transmission across it
 There is no way to repair the break
 
 My man
 Muscles from hand to foot
 Completely coated in uninterrupted skin
 My man
 Signals command the leg
 To follow orders coming down from headquarters
 
 My man
 How can he stand?
 My man
 Muscles from hand to foot
 Completely coated in uninterrupted skin
 My man
 Won't walk again
 
 My other phone is a boom car 
 My other mic is a boom mic 
 Why must I answer to a public that doesn't appreciate me yet?
 
 Grow the nanobots up
 
 Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk
 Wind the nanobots up 
 Wind them up and ask them a question
 
 Raise the yellow bots up
 
 Raise them up and make them respect us
 Wind the marching bots up 
 Wind them up and wish them away
 
 After all the hullabaloo
 We very nearly forgot about you
 Now all the old troubles will soon be at an end
 When all the neurons begin when we send the signal
 To the newborn citizenship
 Of the micronations
 Sleeper cells awaken, now this is your plan
 Hear the voices tuned into the confederates
 See the tiny figures stretching their limbs
 Stand back and watch them
 
 Grow the nanobots up
 Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk
 Wind the nanobots up
 Wind them up and wish them away
 
 The sun is rising in the wrong place
 I would decorate the room but there's no more space
 All I see is pictures of matchstick men
 I turn my back for two minutes and they've grown again
 They're arranging beds
 Using what's available
 In their hand-me-downs
 Making do with leftovers
 Looking up, reading comic books
 Sitting three-deep in each other's laps
 On the messed up notebook of the van
 Riding on the tidal wave where they
 
 Grow the nanobots up
 
 Grow them in the cracks in the sidewalk
 Wind the nanobots up 
 Wind them up and wish them away
 
 Raise the yellow bots up 
 Raise them up and make them respect us
 
 Wind the marching bots up 
 Wind them up and make them to send a signal
 To the newborn citizenship
 Of the micronations
 Sleeper cells awaken now
 This is your, this is your time
 
 I don't want to change your mind
 I don't want to think about your mind
 They say love is blind
 I don't think you're blind
 You don't want to understand
 And I don't want to shake your father's hand
 And walk in the sand
 And act like a man
 
 I get on the bus
 And ride past our stop
 And though I'm late
 I can't get off
 I just can't bear to tell you some lies
 And narrow your eyes
 Narrow your eyes
 
 We'll take back every thing we said
 Split up all the things and move ahead
 Forgot how you said
 We'll split the side off the bed
 
 I get on my bike
 Ride down our block
 Ride through the world
 Through the green lights
 But when I think of all your advice
 I narrow my eyes
 Narrow my eyes
 
 I don't want to change your mind
 I don't want to think about your mind
 They say love is blind
 I don't think you're blind
 
 I get on the bus
 Ride past our stop
 And though I'm late
 I can't get off
 I just can't bear to tell you some lies
 And narrow your eyes
 Narrow your eyes
 
 Now let's toast the sad cold fact
 Our love's never coming back
 And we'll race to the bottom of a glass
 So narrow your eyes
 Narrow your eyes
 Narrow your eyes
 Narrow your eyes
 Narrow your eyes
 Narrow your eyes
 
 I never knew love could be like this
 I never knew love could be like this
 I go around thinking I'm a genius
 But I never knew love could be like this
 
 Cartography is not my m'tier
 And the mountainsides of daydreams too steep for me today
 Lovers lost before us and most did not return
 The few so hale and hardy now broken down and burned
 
 I never knew love could be like this
 Was anyone else but me surprised
 How anything happens is mysterious
 And I never knew love could be like this
 
 Biography is all they understand
 No semaphore or secrets or just good old pretend
 Now they all are sleeping but this keeps us awake
 These words they need safekeeping
 A promise not to break
 
 I never knew love could be like this
 I never knew love could be like this
 I go around thinking I'm a genius
 But I never knew love
 Has there ever been love
 Oh I never knew love could be like this
 
 You called me last night on the telephone
 And I was glad to hear from you 'cause I was all alone
 You said, "It's snowing, it's snowing! God, I hate this weather."
 Now I walk through blizzards just to get us back together
 
 We met in the springtime at a rock-and-roll show
 It was on the Bowery when it was time to go
 We kissed on the subway in the middle of the night
 I held your hand, you held mine, it was the best night of my life.
 
 'Cause everyone's your friend in New York City
 And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
 The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
 But the best thing about New York City is you and me
 
 Statue of Liberty, Staten Island Ferry, Co-op City, Katz's and Tiffany's
 Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, The Empire State where Dylan lived
 Coney Island and Times Square, Rockefeller Center
 Wish I was there
 
 You wrote me a letter just the other day
 Said, "Springtime is coming soon so why don't you come to stay."
 I packed my stuff, got on the bus, I can't believe it's true
 I'm three days from New York City and I'm three days from you
 
 'Cause everyone's my friend in New York City
 And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
 The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
 But the best thing about New York City is you and me
 
 'Cause everyone's my friend in New York City
 And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
 The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
 But the best thing about New York City is you and me.
 
 Fell in the door
 And you fell on the floor
 With your hand on the knob
 Looking up and abruptly
 Forget what you're thinking
 Fire alarms go off in your head
 You live
 
 In the nightgown of the sullen moon
 How the windows lean into the room
 In the nightgown of the sullen moon
 
 Drug trip, it's not a drug trip so you feel a bit insulted
 Space walk, it's like a space walk with the corresponding weight loss
 And you're nothing but air, with your hand in the air
 And your shoelaces tied up together with care
 There's a feeling of boredom
 Of the big whoredom
 Following dressing up
 
 In the nightgown of the sullen moon
 How the windows lean into the room
 In the nightgown of the sullen moon
 
 In the nightgown of the sullen moon
 How the windows lean into the room
 In the nightgown of the sullen moon
 
 Your head is on the moon
 It's not necessary to breathe
 Forever is a long time
 Your head is on the moon
 It's not necessary to breathe
 Forever is a long time
 Your head is on the moon
 Your head is on the moon
 
 Nine bowls of soup are balanced on the end of a rake
 On an ichthyosaur's head
 Woah, woah, woah, woah
 Oh good, none of them spilled
 
 Please can I have one Mr. Ichthyosaur?
 No, you can't, I'm saving them for friends
 But you don't have any friends
 Yes, I do, no, you don't, yes, I do, now be quiet
 I'm trying to concentrate
 
 Nine bowls of soup on the wings of an airplane
 Flown by an ichthyosaur
 Woah, woah, woah
 Lucky thing they didn't all spill
 
 Is there one that's kind of extra? Can I have it for my own?
 No, you can't, I can't break up the set
 But the soup is getting cold, no, it isn't, yes, it is
 No, I don't know what you're talking about
 
 Nine bowls of soup are balanced on a snake
 That the ichthyosaur is taking for a walk
 Woah, woah, woah, waah
 Phew, I really thought that that was it
 
 I just think that you have more than you can handle
 What's all the soup for anyway?
 I didn't think you even really liked soup
 Why do you need nine bowls? Why do you need
 Why do you need nine?
 
 If I tell you what these are for
 Then will you stop bothering me?
 
 Nine bowls of soup arranged a certain way
 Are some radar dishes in a very large array
 And the message they detect from across the Milky Way
 Says the aliens want to join us for lunch
 
 I hope you guys like soup
 
 In the moat of the castle was where the Duke of Something's wife drowned
 And the eyes of her portrait seemed to follow him around
 The bank foreclosed on his dungeon when the Duke was late in paying
 And now he looks at her picture and he seems to hear it saying
 
 "What's it like to be alive?"
 And she's got no answer to that
 She's got no answer that she can hear
 Though she may wonder, she doesn't get an answer
 
 Framed in the diorama is the art of the taxidermist
 Realistically frozen as it's pouncing with a grimace
 Light gleams off of the marbles in the sockets where its eyes were
 And every time they twinkle it's like a question from the tiger:
 
 "What's it like to be alive?"
 And he gets no answer to that
 He gets no answer; he won't know
 He'll always wonder; he doesn't get an answer
 
 Close the window when you hear the howling wind
 It's just a query and you mustn't let it in
 
 On the Southeast Expressway, where they found the empty stroller
 Being blown by the traffic through the trash along the shoulder
 Was it the ghost of somebody who decided not to begin?
 And under the sound of the car horns, can't you hear a small voice asking
 
 "What's it like to be alive?"
 And there is no answer to that
 There is no answer; no one tells
 There is no answer; there isn't any answer
 
 And they get no answer to that
 They get no answer they can hear
 Though they may wonder, there isn't any answer
 
 In my prison cell I think these words
 I was careless
 I can see that now
 I must be silent
 Must contain my secret smile
 I want to tell you
 You my mirror
 You my iron bars
 
 When I made a shadow on my window shade
 They called the police and testified
 But they're like the people chained up in the cave
 In the allegory of the people in the cave by the Greek guy
 
 No one understands
 No one knows my plan
 Why the dancing, shouting
 Why the shrieks of pain
 The lovely music
 Why the smell of burning autumn leaves
 
 No one understands
 No one knows my plan
 Why the dancing, shouting
 Why the shrieks of pain
 The lovely music
 Why the smell of burning autumn leaves
 
 In my prison cell I bide my time
 Always thinking
 Always busy cooking up an angle
 Working on the tiny blueprint of the angle
 Sketching out the burning autumn leaves
 
 No one understands
 No one knows my plan
 I must be silent, must contain my secret smile
 I want to tell you
 You my mirror
 You my iron bars
 
 No one understands
 No one knows my plan
 
 No is no
 No is always no
 If they say no, it means a thousand times no
 
 No plus no equals no
 All nos lead to no no no
 
 Finger pointing, eyebrows low
 Mouth in the shape of the letter O
 
 Pardon me, no!
 Excuse me, no!
 May I stay?
 Can I go?
 No, no, no
 
 Do this, no!
 Don't do that, no!
 Sit, stay, roll over
 No, no, no
 
 Finger pointing, eyebrows low
 Mouth in the shape of the letter O
 Red means stop. Do not go.
 No, no, no
 
 Everybody at the party is a many sided polygon
 When a guest arrives
 They will count how many sides it has on
 
 Standing by the window over there
 There is a shape with four sides, so it's a square
 And the one who has nine is looking fine
 And its name is Nonagon
 
 Everybody turns just in time to see the pentagon arrive
 Counting up the sides, it is clear the pentagon has five
 Chatting in the kitchen we see
 
 There is a triangle whose sides number three
 And is talking to the shape that has nine
 Who is known as Nonagon
 
 Nonagon
 
 Nonagon, lets in a guest who has shown up late
 Its name is Octagon and its sides add up to eight
 Turning the music on is a six sided hexagon
 And they all get in a line and do
 A dance called, 'the Nonagon
 
 The Nonagon
 The Nonagon
 
 All the people are so happy now, their heads are caving in
 I'm glad they are a snowman with protective rubber skin
 But every little thing's a domino that falls on different dots
 And crashes into everything that tries to make it stop
 
 And the mirror, it reflects a tiny dancing skeleton
 Surrounded by a fleshy overcoat and swaddled in
 A furry hat, elastic mask, a pair of shiny marble dice
 Some people call them snake-eyes, but to me they look like mice
 
 And nothing's smelling like a rose
 But I don't care if no one's coming up for air
 I know nothing's gonna change my clothes ever anymore

 No, no, no, no

 I know that nothing's gonna change my clothes ever anymore
 
 Everywhere around this burg
 They're running out of verbs
 Adverbs and adjectives
 Everywhere around this town
 They're running out of nouns
 They're running out of nouns
 
 Have you seen that naughty boy 
 Who steals each blade of grass 
 And replaces it with wires and batteries? 
 In the corner of your eye
 Do you see that scribbled word?
 Do you hear the wind whispering? 
 
 Now Now is strange 
 I'd like to hear what did you change? 
 No, no, it's not before anymore 
 It's gone 
 Weird 
 Now is strange 
 
 With a flathead screwdriver 
 I could remove my apartment buzzer 
 And I know underneath that five would be a six 
 Underneath the six would be 
 Something unbelievable 
 Something I cannot imagine 
 
 Now Now is strange 
 I'd like to hear what did you change? 
 No, it's not before anymore 
 Now Now is strange
 I'd like to hear what did you change? 
 No, no, it's not before anymore 
 It's gone 
 Weird 
 Now is strange 
 I'd like to hear what did you change?
 
 The mirror on the wall
 Won't talk to me at all
 Now that I have everything
 The place inside the frame
 Just doesn't look the same
 Now that I have everything
 
 I wasn't always so fortunate
 But I knew what I had to do
 To be well-to-do
 And it had to do
 With the things I had to do
 
 And I don't want anything
 I don't want anything
 Now that I have everything
 I can't tell things apart
 I don't know where they start
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday
 
 Put down that surfboard, no, please don't say
 All the things I think I know that you're about to say
 "Everything is everything," is what you're just about to say
 
 There was a program, sort of an inquiry
 Into what would be
 Just the thing for me
 If it came to be
 I would have to wait and see
 
 And I don't want anything
 I don't want anything
 Now that I have everything
 I can't tell things apart
 I don't know where they start
 Now that I have everything
 
 And the mirror on the wall
 Won't talk to me at all
 Now that I have everything
 The place inside the frame
 Just doesn't look the same
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday 
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday 
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday 
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday 
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday 
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday 
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday 
 Now there's everything don't remind me of yesterday 
 Babool Babool
 
 There's only two songs in me and I just wrote the third
 Don't know where I got the inspiration or how I wrote the words
 Spent my whole life just digging up my music's shallow grave
 For the two songs in me and the third one I just made
 
 A rich man once told me
 "Hey life's a funny thing"
 A poor man once told me
 That he can't afford to speak
 Now I'm in the middle like a bird without a beak 'cause
 
 There's just two songs in me and I just wrote the third
 Don't know where I got the inspiration or how I wrote the words
 Spent my whole life just digging up my music's shallow grave
 For the two songs in me and the third one I just made
 
 So I went to the President
 And I asked old what's-his-name
 Has he ever gotten writer's block
 Or something like the same
 He just started talking
 Like he was on TV
 "If there's just two songs in ya, boy
 Whaddaya want from me?"
 
 So I bought myself some denim pants
 And a silver guitar
 But I politely told the ladies
 "You'll still have to call me Sir
 Because I have to keep my self-respect
 I'll never be a star
 Since there's just two songs in me
 And this is Number Three"
 
 Oh, do not forsake me, my indolent friends
 Oh, do not forsake me though you know I must spend
 All my darkest hours talking like this
 For I am one thousand years old
 
 One thousand years old
 Sure, you think that's old
 One thousand years old
 But what do you know?
 In my darkest hour I'm talking like this
 For I am one thousand years old
 
 Oh, some have forgotten the flower of speech
 And walks through the garden where I go to defend
 Misbegotten notions while talking like this
 For I am one thousand years old
 
 One thousand years old
 Sure, I'd say that's old
 One thousand years old
 But what do I know?
 In your darkest hour, my indolent friends
 We'll be one thousand years old
 
 O tannenbaum, o tannenbaum
 Wie treu sind deine bl'tte
 Do gr'nst nicht nur zur sommerzeit
 Nein, auch I'm winter wenn es schneit
 O tannenbaum, o tannenbaum
 Wie treu sind deine bl'tte
 
 They tried the handcuffs but they won't lock
 Electrical courses but they won't shock
 You pulled the fire alarm 
 You tried punching a cop
 You're just too tired to stop
 You old pine box
 
 You old pine box
 With your head full of rocks
 Sharp like a cracked flowerpot
 You old paper hat
 On your skull full of bats
 There's no percentage in that
 
 They called relations but they declined
 They called the fanclub but they resigned 
 Left your car in a field
 And some questions behind
 Your mom thinks you're out of your mind
 
 (Over the falls and into the drink
 The barrel breaks
 And we slowly sink)
 
 They tried the handcuffs but they won't lock
 Electrical courses but they won't shock
 You pulled the fire alarm 
 You tried punching a cop
 You're just too tired to stop
 You old pine box
 
 You're older than you've ever been.
 And now you're even older. 
 And now you're even older. 
 And now you're even older. 
 
 You're older than you've ever been.
 And now you're even older. 
 And now you're older still. 
 
 Time! Is marching on.
 And time, is still marching on. 
 This day will soon be at an end and now it's even sooner. 
 And now it's even sooner.
 And now it's even sooner.
 This day will soon be at an end and now it's even sooner. 
 And now it's even sooner.
 And now it's sooner still. 
 
 You're older than you've ever been.
 And now you're even older. 
 And now you're even older. 
 And now you're even older. 
 
 You're older than you've ever been.
 And now you're even older. 
 And now you're older still.
 
 Her burden of things walking out
 Her burden of things walking out
 On Earth my Nina
 On Earth my Nina
 God forbid a vaguer feat
 National hell mock me
 Say the sparrow wants a morbid arrow
 Here's a quarter; that's the one I want
 Maybe I'll buy the whirlwind
 That always keeps me yearning
 Her sitter's down there mourning
 Her burden of things walking out
 Her burden of things walking out
 On Earth my Nina
 On Earth my Nina
 
 You're only happy when you're sad
 You're top fueled and you're bad
 Parachute in your back pack and
 Your knees under your chin
 And your boyfriend's getting mad
 At all the time you waste
 Trying to put your finger on it
 The allure of St. Marks place
 
 On the drag, on the drag
 You're all waiting 'round for something
 And it's never coming back
 On the drag, on the drag
 It's a genuine disaster
 And it's come to make you king
 On the drag
 
 "I won't die until I'm dead,"
 Are the first words that he said
 Don't try to interrupt him,
 'Cause he's never gonna stop
 And the time is standing still
 With all this time to kill
 And I'm trying to walk away
 From 1st Avenue to A
 
 On the drag, on the drag
 It's a genuine disaster
 And we've crowned him with his crown
 On the drag, on the drag
 We're all waiting 'round for something
 And it's never coming back
 On the drag, on the drag
 We're all waiting 'round for something
 And it's never coming back
 
 On the drag, on the drag
 We're all waiting for disaster
 And we crowned him with his crown
 On the drag
 
 Ondine
 You won
 All she left behind was an unloaded gun
 And my face
 
 Is blushing
 For all the things she's done
 You couldn't miss that girl
 'Cause here she comes
 
 Ondine
 Back up
 Run over my body with your pickup truck
 And finish
 
 What you started
 Because I'm done
 I searched the whole room over
 To find these words
 
 She said
 I had the strangest dream
 I dreamed I killed you again
 Don't make me kill you again
 
 'Cause I couldn't bear to kill you again
 Ondine
 Was here
 You couldn't even take away a souvenir
 
 Of what's left
 Of that swinger
 She used to call me that
 I searched the whole room over
 
 To find these words
 She said
 I had the strangest dream
 I dreamed I killed you again
 
 Don't make me kill you again
 'Cause I couldn't bear to kill you
 I had the strangest dream
 I dreamed I killed you again
 Don't make me kill you again
 'Cause I couldn't bear to kill you again
 
 I am a girl, I'm eleven years old
 That's one more than ten and one less than twelve
 
 At noon
 
 I was eating a cupcake from a baker's dozen
 
 That's thirteen cupcakes
 And the postman rang the doorbell to deliver a package
 It was a barrel that came from the jungle
 
 One dozen monkeys jumped right out of the monkey barrel
 Twelve crazy monkeys ran right out of the monkey barrel
 Eleven monkeys ran up into the tree, one monkey stayed behind
 And now that monkey rides a bike around with me
 
 Mom was upset with the monkeys in the tree
 And the monkey on a bike which I named Larry
 With a dozen bananas she got the monkeys in the barrel
 And gave it to the postman to send back to the jungle
 
 But then the monkeys jumped back out of the monkey barrel
 Twelve crazy monkeys ran right out of the monkey barrel
 Eleven monkeys ran back into the tree, one monkey stayed behind
 And now that monkey rides a bike around with me
 
 His name is Larry
 
 There's only one everything
 Remember these words
 There's only one everything
 And if you go out and count up everything
 It all adds up to one
 
 There's only one everything
 The last time I checked
 There's only one everything
 It kinda makes sense that there would only be
 Just one, not ten, not three
 
 If you get all the stuff together
 And you have not left something out
 Then could there still be anything left over?
 I'm pretty sure that means there could not
 
 We share the same omniverse
 Please clean your room
 We share the same omniverse
 And even though you are over here and not there
 There's just one everywhere
 
 You got the cars, the trees, the house
 There are some clouds, some birds, a monster
 And when it's all too much to count up
 You can put it in one pile
 
 What if you drew a giant circle
 What if it went around all there is
 Then would there still be such a thing as an outside
 And does that question even make any sense?
 
 There's only one everything
 The last time I checked
 There's only one everything
 It kinda makes sense that there would only be
 Just one, not ten, not three, not twelve
 
 There's only one everything
 Remember these words
 There's only one everything
 And if you go out and count up everything
 It all adds up to one
 
 It all adds up, it all adds up
 It all adds up to one
 
 Hup, two, three, four, marching down the street
 Rollin' of the drums and the tramping of the feet
 General salutes and the mothers wave and weep
 Here comes the big parade
 Don't be afraid, prices paid
 One more parade
 
 So young, so strong, so ready for the war
 So willing to go and die upon a foreign shore
 All march together, everybody looks the same
 So there is no one you can blame
 Don't be ashamed, light the flame
 One more parade
 
 Listen for the sound and listen for the noise
 Listen for the thunder of the marching boys
 A few years ago their guns were only toys
 Here comes the big parade
 Don't be afraid, prices paid
 One more parade
 
 So young, so strong, so ready for the war
 So willing to go and die upon a foreign shore
 All march together, everybody looks the same
 So there is no one you can blame
 Don't be ashamed, light the flame
 One more parade
 
 Medals on their coats and guns in their hands
 Trained to kill as they're trained to stand
 Ten thousand ears need only one command
 Here comes the big parade
 Don't be afraid, prices paid
 Don't be ashamed, war's a game
 World's in flames, so start the parade

 Smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee
 Bounce their shoes at the end of their feet
 And wish they could go home
 Operators are standing by
 Poking holes in the ceiling tiles
 Making jokes about their old boyfriends
 And days gone by
 Operators are standing by
 Talking about their portrayal
 On the TV when an actress sits
 with a headset in outer space
 That's enough talking, ladies
 Operators are standing by
 Smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee
 Pass around a picture of a mobius strip
 And wish they could go home

 Long before the screen door slammed, she was out of Xenia
 A stranger could have loved that town but she had to leave
 
 I wish I'd gotten to know her before I fell in love
 I could say who's to blame, say who's the man in this cautionary tale
 But I swore I'd be true and I'll swear and I'll swear 'til Kitten's out of jail
 
 It was like a TV show, the way she stole that car
 Easy now to criticize, easy now to talk
 
 I thought my luck was changing, I guess I was wrong
 I could say who's to blame, say who's the man in this cautionary tale
 But I swore I'd be true and I'll swear and I'll swear 'til Kitten's out of jail
 
 Didn't want to be a slave
 Just turned out that way
 
 I wish I'd gotten to know her before I fell in love
 I could say she's to blame, say she's the man in this cautionary tale
 But I swore I'd be true and I'll swear and I'll swear 'til Kitten's out of jail
 
 Particle man, particle man
 Doing the things a particle can
 What's he like? It's not important
 Particle man
 
 Is he a dot, or is he a speck?
 When he's underwater does he get wet?
 Or does the water get him instead?
 Nobody knows, Particle man
 
 Triangle man, Triangle man
 Triangle man hates particle man
 They have a fight, Triangle wins
 Triangle man
 
 Universe man, Universe man
 Size of the entire universe man
 Usually kind to smaller man
 Universe man
 
 He's got a watch with a minute hand,
 Millennium hand and an eon hand
 When they meet it's a happy land
 Powerful man, universe man
 
 Person man, person man
 Hit on the head with a frying pan
 Lives his life in a garbage can
 Person man
 
 Is he depressed or is he a mess?
 Does he feel totally worthless?
 Who came up with person man?
 Degraded man, person man
 
 Triangle man, triangle man
 Triangle man hates person man
 They have a fight, triangle wins
 Triangle man
 
 The possible dream
 Finale of seem
 The moment that some call eternal that some call insane
 Now helmets on each head awaiting the first lead
 The pageant is named the pencil rain
 
 The infantry stands
 And holds out its hands
 The marshal's binoculars focus and skyward they train
 They're searching the yonder blue
 They look out for number two
 The heraldry of the pencil rain
 
 And now hear the roar that none can ignore
 The thunderous clatter of splintering wood and lives that are claimed
 And none who have witnessed all
 Can think of a nobler cause than perishing in the pencil rain
 The pencil rain
 The pencil rain
 The pencil rain
 
 You gave me a pet name
 Which is not to say I like it
 We met at a party
 Not to say I was invited
 
 You said love was just a lie
 But I could tell that you were lying
 And we almost figured out how we'd get along
 And given time we'd find it strange to be alone and
 
 You work in a hotel
 At the magazine concession
 Back in just five minutes
 Reads the sign above your station
 
 Slip your profits in a bag
 And you're looking up to the hour hand
 And we almost figured out how we'll get along
 And given time we'll find it strange to be alone and
 
 You just forgot your one pet name for me
 And all those promises you said you'd keep
 And it's a lucky thing
 Because that sentimental stuff
 Doesn't suit you
 At all
 
 Waiting at the bus stop
 For just about an hour
 Strategies for hangman
 Cat's cradle, origami
 
 You say I'm OK for a guy
 But I can tell that you are lying
 And we've almost figured out how we'll get along
 And given time we'll find it strange to be alone and
 
 You just forgot your one pet name for me
 And all those promises you said you'd keep
 And it's a lucky thing
 Because that sentimental stuff
 Doesn't
 
 You just forgot your one pet name for me
 And all those promises you said you'd keep
 And it's a lucky thing
 Because that sentimental stuff
 Doesn't suit you
 At all

 Piece of dirt, that is all I'm standing on today
 Piece of dirt, the whole world has slipped away
 I would climb the highest mountain just to jump into a fountain
 Or to fly, I'd fly away
 
 A woman's voice on the radio can convince you you're in love
 A woman's voice on the telephone can convince you you're alone
 But I set my sails so long ago they've revoked my sailor's badge
 Said I should be content and happy on this ink spot where I stand
 
 Piece of dirt, that is all I'm standing on today
 Piece of dirt, the whole world has slipped away
 I find myself haunted by a spooky man named me
 I wish that I could jump out of my skin
 
 Listen children, hear this story
 That will take you around the world
 In the belly of the vessels
 Stowed away nine pirate girls
 
 Nine pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
 
 One named Polly had a parrot
 The second named Polly had a parrot too
 That's the part that is confusing
 And they were identical twins
 
 The third was Nancy, she was fancy
 Walked around with a fake tattoo
 And four through nine were all named Peggy
 And each one only wore one shoe
 
 Nine pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
 
 Legend grew about their daring
 Never did they walk the plank
 They all shared one golden earring
 And the truth is they all stank
 
 If you finished all your homework
 Brushed your teeth and done your chores
 And it's not too past your bedtime
 Then your folks might tell you more of the
 
 Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
 
 Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
 
 Please pass the milk, please
 
 Can you tell that I'm planning prevenge?
 Read my mind, yes, I'm planning prevenge
 At the freak show,
 In the front row,
 Mi amigo,
 Lost in the sound.
 
 Now you know that the girls are just making it up,
 Now you know that the boys are just pushing their luck
 Now you know that my ride doesn't really exist,
 And my name's not really on that list.
 
 Can you tell that I'm planning prevenge?
 Read my mind, yes, I'm planning prevenge
 
 Fully moto
 On the headfo
 Rock the info
 The micro-type king
 
 Calling Mr. Pupkin
 To join us at the love-in
 Because Pupkin comes alive
 When prevenge is the plan
 See Pupkin take the stand.
 
 Tired of waiting,
 Tired of watching,
 Negotiating,
 Parading around.
 
 Now you know that the girls are just making it up,
 Now you know that the boys are just pushing their luck,
 Now you know that my ride doesn't really exist,
 And my name's not really on that list.

 She stole my daydreams
 She stole my air guitar
 Exterior man on lawn alone at dawn
 Packed the typewriter and drove off in her car
 A battered automobile drives past state line sign
 And now I know that I'll rue the day I let her get away
 
 I need a haircut I got myself to blame
 A gloved hand spins a combination dial
 Quickly opening a large wall safe
 
 He wasn't so fine to my beginner's mind
 Motel the other man severe refined
 But with that big talk I should have seen the signs
 Woman enters and they embrace he packs duct tape rope
 And right on her he was fixing his aim
 He pushed me out of frame
 I need new head shots I got myself to blame
 She spins her ring to hide the diamond in her hand
 And drops a gun into a small beaded purse
 
 Script format may seem strange to the novice
 But like any other business
 It's a standard that the writer gets used to
 
 Know the diff between a script and a spec
 It's a test just your stage direction left
 And no camera notes to use
 
 My scenes are cut out I'm just on speaker phone
 For exposition I'm out here on my own
 And as the night falls on this sleepy town
 The iris closes down
 I missed my close-up
 I got myself to blame
 
 I remember the year I went to camp
 I heard about some lady named Selma and some blacks
 Somebody put their fingers in the President's ears
 It wasn't too much later they came out with Johnson's wax
 I remember the book depository where they crowned the king of Cuba
 Now that's all I can think of, but I'm sure there's something else
 Way down inside me I can feel it coming back
 
 Purple toupee will show the way when summer brings you down
 
 Purple toupee and gold lame will turn your brain around
 
 Chinese people were fighting in the park
 We tried to help them fight, no one appreciated that
 Martin X was mad when they outlawed bell bottoms
 Ten years later they were sharing the same cell
 I shouted out, "Free the Expo '67"
 Till they stepped on my hair, and they told me I was fat
 Now I'm very big, I'm a big important man
 And the only thing that's different is underneath my hat
 
 Purple toupee will show the way when summer brings you down
 
 Purple toupee and gold lame will turn your brain around
 
 Purple toupee is here to stay after the hair has gone away
 The purple brigade is marching from the grave
 
 We're on some kind of mission
 We have an obligation
 We have to wear toupees
 
 You would give up your right arm to go back
 To when you had a right arm
 You'll need some muscles
 To move it backward
 Push back the hands of time
 
 Broken glass is glittering like diamonds
 Can't hear yourself thinking over the sirens
 Push back the hands of time
 Push back the hands of time
 
 You wanna sing to drown out the car horn
 Squeeze your eyes shut and scream like a newborn
 Like a newborn babe
 
 Dawn breaks like a fallen vase
 Push back the hands of time
 Unwelcome vision of rosy fingers
 Push back the hands of time
 
 It wouldn't help you if you'd had any sleep
 It wouldn't save you from the mission creep
 Push back the hands of time
 Push back the hands of time
 
 Screeching tires but never a collision
 Endless day without a sunset provision
 Endless day
 
 Push back the hands of time
 Push back the hands of time
 
 You wanna sing to drown out the car horn
 Squeeze your eyes shut and scream like a newborn
 Like a newborn babe
 
 Push back the hands of time
 Push back the hands of time
 Push back the hands of time
 Push back the hands of time
 Push back the hands of time
 Push back the hands of time
 Push back the hands of time
 Push back the hands of time
 
 As your body floats down Third Street
 With the burn-smell factory closing up
 Yes it's sad to say you will romanticize
 All the things you've known before
 It was not not not so great
 It was not not not so great
 And as you take a bath in that beaten path
 There's a pounding at the door
 Well It's a mighty zombie talking of some love and posterity
 He says "The good old days never say good-bye
 If you keep this in your mind:
 You need some lo-lo-loving arms
 You need some lo-lo-loving arms"
 And as you fall from grace the only words you say are
 
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 Put your hand inside
 Put your hand inside
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 
 Ads up in the subway are the work of someone
 Trying to please their boss
 And though the guy's a pig we all know what he wants
 Is just to please somebody else
 If the pu-pu-puppet head
 Was only bu-bu-busted in
 It would be a better thing for everyone involved
 And we wouldn't have to cry
 
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 Put your hand inside
 Put your hand inside
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 
 Memo to myself, do the dumb things I gotta do
 Touch the puppet head
 
 Quit my job down at the car wash
 Didn't have to write no-one a good-bye note
 That said, "The check's in the mail, and
 I'll see you in church, and don't you ever change"
 If the pu-pu-puppet head
 Was only bu-bu-busted in
 I'll see you after school
 
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 Put your hand inside
 Put your hand inside
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 Put your hand inside
 Put your hand inside
 Put your hand inside the puppet head
 
 Q you

 Rabid child stays at home, talks on a CB
 Truckers pass calling out their handles to the kid
 Chess Piece Face and The Big Duluth call her every day
 "Hammer down" and "rabbit ears" are the only words they know
 
 Hammer down
 Hammer down, rabbit ears
 Hammer down, rabbit ears
 Hammer down, rabbit ears, hammer down
 
 If you pass the rabid child say "hammer down" for me
 The rabid child
 The rabid child
 The rabid child
 
 Moths beat on the windowpane
 Telling me I'm not the same
 Sounds of nothing, sounds of fear
 Speak to me when no one's near
 
 I'm on rat patrol
 I'm on rat patrol
 
 Well, those disappear inside
 Floorboards creak and footsteps heard
 Headlights turn into the drive
 Then disappear into the night
 
 I'm on rat patrol
 I'm on rat patrol

 I'll ask John
 
 How could you ask me that?
 How could I know?
 How could you ask me that?
 How could I know?
 
 How fast is the speed of light?
 I don't know, did it say in the book?

 Replicant, replicant, where have you been?
 Replicant, what is that stuff in your hair?
 Replicant, why do you lie on the ground?
 Shoveling handfuls of dirt on yourself
 
 You've got his eyes
 Same exact smile
 Doot doot doot doot
 Doot doot doot
 doot doot doot doot doot
 All that he has
 All this will be yours
 Doot doot doot doot

 Replicant, someone is waiting outside
 He says you did something wrong to his friend
 Look at me when I'm talking to you
 What have you got there behind your back?
 
 You've got his eyes
 Same exact smile
 All that he has
 All this will be yours
 
 I found this when I was cleaning your room
 I think you've got some explaining to do
 Whatever you did, we'll get through this
 Go out the back and I'll deal with the cops
 
 You've got his eyes
 Same exact smile
 Doot doot doot doot

 Each night I lie awake
 Completely alone
 A voice is calling, and I tremble
 For it's not my own
 My own
 I can't ignore it
 Although I try
 The intrusive whisper fascinates me
 Here's why
 Here's why
 
 The secrets gather 'round as the voice recites
 The secret history of my immortal soul
 
 Indestructible
 Indefensible
 Reprehensible
 10,000 years of unraisable acts
 And permanent facts
 The record of my
 Unspeakable crimes
 In previous lives
 In previous times
 Indelibly stains
 The pages of history
 
 Indestructible
 Indefensible
 Reprehensible
 Night after night a voice recites my misdeeds
 And puts me to sleep
 But tells me that I
 Won't remember a thing
 
 When morning comes at last
 I rub my eyes
 Remember nothing and thinking
 Only of my plans
 My plans
 
 The world is spinning 'round and I'm on the top
 And nothing in the world can ever make me stop
 
 Indestructible
 Indefensible
 Reprehensible
 10,000 years of unraisable acts
 And permanent facts
 And only I know
 Who's responsible
 Indefensible
 Reprehensible
 Me.
 
 I got rid of my jackets and coats
 I threw out all of my pants
 I got sick of my stinkin' clothes
 I had to get rid of them
 
 I'm knot yet considering replacing them
 I'm only glad to be rid of them
 
 Rest awhile
 Rest awhile
 
 I lay out in the sun too long
 And burned off all of my skin
 I felt so dizzy I got into the car
 And got into an accident
 
 Out of the burning wreckage I fell
 Wanting only to lay where I fell
 
 Rest awhile
 Rest awhile
 Rest awhile!
 
 I became friendly with Ruy Lopez
 The author of works on chess
 Ruy said you're incorrect
 He cut me off and acted mad
 
 He won't even talk to me now
 But I don't care 'cause I'm sick of that guy
 
 And I need to rest a while
 Rest a while
 
 In a world we call our home there's lots of room to roam
 Plenty of time to turn mistakes into rhyme
 There's a place for those who love their poetry
 It's just across from the sign that says, "Pros only"
 
 So if you like a band with a chick singer,
 Say your cup of tea is a wall of trombones
 If you dig Menudo, or M-D-C we salute you the way we know
 For every one with dollar signs in his eyes
 There must be hundreds who look at you as if you're some kind of
 Rhythm section want ad
 No others need apply to the rhythm section want ad
 I'll tell you why
 
 Hats off to the new age hairstyle made of bones
 Hats off to the use of hats as megaphones
 Speak softly, drive a Sherman tank
 Laugh hard, it's a long way to the bank
 
 Do you sing like Olive Oyl on purpose
 You guys must be into the Eurythmics
 For every one with dollar signs in his eyes
 There must be hundreds who look at you as if you're some kind of
 Rhythm section want ad
 No others need apply to the rhythm section want ad
 And here's the reason why

 She's a different kind of girl
 The kind you see in pictures
 I think you might have seen her
 Richards on Richards
 
 You know what I mean
 You know what I mean
 You know what I mean mean
 Richards
 
 She doesn't ride a motor bike 
 She says it doesn't fit her
 But she always wears a monocle 
 Richards on Richards
 
 You know what I mean
 You know what I mean
 You know what I mean mean
 Richards
 
 Look over there 
 Check out her hair
 She's really on an ego trip 
  Oh! Look at her!

 We're in a road movie to Berlin
 Can't drive out the way we drove in
 So sneak out this glass of bourbon
 And we'll go
 
 We were once so close to heaven
 Peter came out and gave us medals
 Declaring us the nicest of the damned
 
 Time won't find the lost
 It'll sweep up our skeleton bones
 So take the wheel and I will take the pedals
 
 We're in a road movie to Berlin
 Can't drive out the way we drove in
 So sneak out this glass of bourbon
 And we'll go
 
 In a future time children will work together to build a giant Siborg
 Robot parade, robot parade, wave the flags that the robots made
 Rob parade, robot parade, robots obey what the children say
 
 There's electric cars, there's electric trains, here comes a robot with electric brains
 Robot parade, robot parade, wave the flags that the robots made
 Robot parade, robot parade, robots obey what the children say

 Dressed only in clothes
 From her head to her toes
 This is the way
 The talking part goes
 
 S-E-X-X-Y
 More than enough
 Around the clock with nobody else
 S-E-X-X-Y
 
 There she is
 Standing on the bed
 Cookie in one hand, wig on her head
 S-E-X-X-Y
 
 X because it's extra baby
 why because it's extra baby
 Unnoticed by few
 Very very few
 And that includes you
 
 Look inside your mind
 Look inside your eye
 Secret agent spy, come to see why
 S-E-X-X-Y
 
 One finger nail
 Across your back
 Baby's first gold tooth initials inscribed
 S-E-X-X-Y
 
 X because it's extra baby
 why because it's extra baby
 You gotta understand
 She wants to be your man
 She's got another plan
 
 I've been told that a boy is a girl
 This isn't true anywhere in the world
 You got a heart for a head, breakfast in bed
 You got a sally boy candy bar
 And it's driving me out of my car
 You got a sally boy candy bar
 And it's making me mad
 You got a sally boy candy bar
 And it illustrates the way we are
 
 Never mind the clothes you wear
 Never mind the cross you bear
 None of these things can compare
 When circle gets the square
 
 I've been told when a fish needs a bike
 The fish can walk or take a hike
 With breakfast in bed, heart for a head
 You got a sally boy candy bar
 And it's driving me out of my car
 You got a sally boy candy bar
 And it's making me mad
 You got a sally boy candy bar
 And it illustrates the way we are

 JF: Hey. We're sorry we were away so long but we had to write this song.
 
 JL: We--John, why don't we explain this--
 We've been doing songs for each venues where we play in.
 We make up a song for every venue.
 As you can imagine, they're not all...you know, hit-bound.
 I just wanted to say that.
 
 JF: I don't think we have anything to apologize for. Except for this one.
 
 JL: But this one! Is! This one is going to be, uh, you know,
 I think Avril Lavigne has her mitts on this one.
 
 JF: This one is kind of a collision of our art-fuck background and
 The skateboard part of this town. Combined.

 Once a year my friend puts on a red suit
 And hangs around with me and my wife
 Now I can't help but feeling jealous each time she climbs on his knee
 And she stands beneath the mistletoe screaming
 For him to stand beneath the mistletoe screaming
 Now I can't help but feeling jealous each time she climbs on his knee
 Why must she climb on his knee?
 
 I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
 She kissed him once and whispered in his ear
 I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
 I wish he would go
 He's breaking up my home
 
 She always had this twisted side to her
 But she'd never drag my name around town
 But lately she's been humming cheating songs
 And I don't like that fat guy around
 No, I don't like that fat guy around
 
 I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
 She kissed him once and whispered in his ear
 I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
 I wish he would go
 He's breaking up my home
 
 I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
 Thrilling Christmas, trembling fear
 I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
 I wish he would go
 He's breaking up my home
 
 Pistol shots
 Gun shots
 Pistol shots
 Gun shots
 
 Bullets from a revolver
 Bullets from a gun
 Bullets through the atmosphere
 Here they come
 
 John, I've been bad
 And they're coming after me
 Done someone wrong
 And I fear that it was me
 
 Sapphire bullets
 Bullets of pure love
 
 Sapphire bullets
 Bullets of pure love
 
 Science is real
 From the Big Bang to DNA
 Science is real
 From evolution to the Milky Way
 I like the stories
 About angels, unicorns and elves
 Now I like the stories 
 As much as anybody else
 But when I'm seeking knowledge
 Either simple or abstract
 The facts are with science
 The facts are with science
 
 Science is real
 Science is real
 Science is real
 
 Science is real
 From anatomy to geology
 Science is real from astrophysics to biology
 A scientific theory
 Isn't just a hunch or guess
 It's more like a question
 That's been put through a lot of tests
 And when a theory emerges
 Consistent with the facts
 The proof is with science
 The truth is with science
 
 Science is real
 Science is real
 Science is real
 
 Science is real
 
 I lay my head on the railroad track
 Stare at the sky all painted up
 Your train is gone, won't be coming back
 
 See the constellation ride across the sky
 No cigar, no lady on his arm
 Just a guy made of dots and lines
 Just a guy made of dots and lines
 
 Two years ago moved from my town
 I was looking up past the city lights
 But the city lights got in my way
 
 See the constellation ride across the sky
 No cigar, no lady on his arm
 Just a guy made of dots and lines
 Just a guy made of dots and lines
 
 I found my mind on the ground below
 I was looking down, it was looking back
 I was in the sky all dressed in black
 
 See the constellation ride across the sky
 No cigar, no lady on his arm
 Just a guy made of dots and lines
 Just a guy made of dots and lines
 Just a guy made of dots and lines
 
 Can you hear what I see in the sky?
 Can you hear what I see in the sky?
 Can you hear what I see in the sky?
 
 When I was only a zygote
 I still remember the time
 When there was nothing to know or to think about
 Except the sound of my mind
 And the sound from outside
 
 SenSurround
 Down at the bottom
 Sensible to ear and sternum
 And the world first spoke to me in SenSurround
 
 If mom had known she was expecting
 She might have gone to see Jaws
 Instead of picking a film where the sound effects
 Came right up through the floor
 And I'd be differently formed
 
 SenSurround
 Down at the bottom
 Sensible to ear and sternum
 And the world first spoke to me in SenSurround.
 
 Accidently in a coal mine it was found
 When they accidently dug too far down
 And found the SenSurround
 
 I still don't know who conceived it
 Or where they got the idea,
 But there it was in the aisle by the exit sign
 A woofer covered in wood
 to shake the room when it should
 
 SenSurround
 Down at the bottom
 Sensible to ear and sternum
 Made the fakeness realistic
 When the action went ballistic
 One degree shy of sadistic
 And the world first spoke to me in SenSurround
 
 If I could swim under the water
 without having to breathe
 If I could follow the trail to the ocean floor
 I think I'd know what there'd be
 Down there waiting for me
 
 SenSurround
 Down at the bottom
 Sensible to ear and sternum
 Made the fakeness realistic
 When the action went ballistic
 One degree shy of sadistic
 And the world first spoke to me in SenSurround
 
 Oh, there's the doorbell
 Let's see who's out there
 Oh, it's a seven
 Hello, Seven
 Won't you come in, Seven?
 Make yourself at home
 
 Hey, who's that other guy?
 Is that your friend there?
 Oh, that's just Seven
 Another seven
 Hello, Seven
 Won't you come in as well?
 
 Now who would like some cake?
 I would like some cake, me too
 
 What's that at the window?
 A whole bunch of sevens
 They're coming in now
 And there's a lot of them
 And down the chimney too
 Hey guys, come on in
 
 I bet they want some cake
 We want cake, where's our cake?
 
 My house is full of sevens
 They're filling up the living room
 Sliding down the banister
 Talking on the telephone
 Inviting over more sevens
 It's a green house at the end of the block
 
 I'm running out of cake
 We want cake, where's our cake?
 
 My house is full of sevens
 We want cake, where's our cake?
 Lots and lots of sevens
 We want cake, where's our cake?
 
 Many more are stopping by
 Sevens add and multiply
 There's only one way to subtract them
 Let them eat up all the cake
 
 Oh no, no, I never go to work
 Oh no, no, I never go to work
 Oh no, no, I never go to work
 Oh no, no, I never go to work
 
 On Mondays I never go to work
 On Tuesdays I stay at home
 On Wednesdays I never feel inclined
 Work is the last thing on my mind
 
 On Thursdays, it's a holiday
 And Fridays I detest
 Oh, it's much too late on a Saturday
 And Sunday is the day of rest
 
 Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet everyday
 Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet everyday
 Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet everyday
 Oh yes, yes, practice trumpet everyday
 
 Practice Monday
 Practice Tuesday
 Practice Wednesday
 
 Practice Thursday
 And Friday
 And I practiced all night on Saturday
 So on Sundays I played best
 
 Oh no, no, I never go to work
 Oh no, no, I never go to work
 Oh no, no, I never go to work
 Oh no, no, I never go to work
 
 On Mondays I never go to work
 On Tuesdays I stay at home
 On Wednesdays I never feel inclined
 Work is the last thing on my mind
 
 On Thursdays, it's a holiday
 And Fridays I detest
 Oh, it's much too late on a Saturday
 And Sunday is the day of rest
 
 It's the day of rest
 
 Night-time lady
 She says maybe
 In the all-night laundromat
 Wait one minute
 I have seen her
 She's a billionaire
 
 She was a hotel detective
 But now she's gotten promoted
 I don't think it was the money
 She didn't care about expensive things
 No furs or pearls or fancy cars or diamond rings
 
 She was a hotel detective
 But now she's better connected
 She didn't have to change anything
 Just the stencil on her window
 
 She used to be quite a lady
 She drove the underworld crazy
 But now she goes insane in her way
 When it suits her occupation
 
 She read that motel directive
 It told her she was defective
 I guess she found an easier way
 Up the ladder and she took it
 Now that lady is running the world
 
 Is she lonely
 She's the only
 Girl in this back alleyway
 Will she shoot you
 She won't have to
 You're already dead
 
 She was a hotel detective

 Words fail
 Buildings tumble
 The ground opens wide
 Light beams down from heaven
 She stands before my eyes
 
 She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
 Squares may look distant in her rear view mirror but they're actual size
 As she drives away
 
 Big men
 Often tremble
 As they step aside
 I thought I was big once
 She changed my mind
 
 She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me.
 I've never known anybody like her, she's actual size
 Nationwide, believe
 
 She's got
 All the money
 Money couldn't buy
 She's got something special
 That someone left behind
 
 She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
 Squares may look distant in her rear view mirror but they're actual size
 Actual size to her
 
 Her face
 Hangs in portrait
 On the post office wall
 She's stuck in my heart now
 Where my blood belongs
 
 She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
 I've never known anybody like her, she's actual size
 Actual size, believe
 
 I met someone at the dog show
 She was holding my left arm
 But everyone was acting normal so I tried to look nonchalant.
 We both said, "I really love you,"
 The Shriners loaned us cars
 We raced up and down the sidewalk twenty thousand million times
 
 Why did they send her over anyone else?
 How should I react? These things happen to other people
 They don't happen at all, in fact
 
 When you're following an angel
 Does it mean you have to throw your body off a building?
 Somewhere they're meeting on a pinhead
 Calling you an angel, calling you the nicest things
 I heard they had a space program
 When they sing you can't hear, there's no air
 Sometimes I think I kind of like that and
 Other times I think I'm already there
 
 Gonna ask for my admission
 Gonna speak to the man in charge
 The secretary says he's on another line,
 Can I hold for a long, long time?
 I found out she's an angel
 I don't think she knows I know
 I'm worried that something might happen to me
 If anyone ever finds out
 
 Why, why did they send her over anyone else?
 How should I react? These things happen to other people
 They don't happen at all

 He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
 People should get beat up for stating their beliefs
 He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
 Because he knows there's no such thing
 
 He asks a girl if they can both sit in a chair but he doesn't get nervous
 She's not really there
 
 He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
 Because he knows there's no such thing
 
 Tour the world in a heavy metal band
 But they run out of gas
 The plane can never land
 
 He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
 People should get beat up for stating their beliefs
 He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
 Because he knows there's no such thing
 
 What's the sense in ever thinking about the tomb
 When you're much too busy returning to the womb?
 
 He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
 People should get beat up for stating their beliefs
 He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
 Because he knows there's no such thing
 
 Each 
 Time 
 I 
 Sleep 
 I'm 
 Sad 
 I 
 Will be replaced by somebody else
 
 In the morning
 Exactly like me
 Going around, drinking all my drinks
 Kissing my wife
 Thinking what I think
 Making me resentful but
 
 Each
 Time
 I
 Get up in the morning I'm glad
 I 
 Took
 Someone else's place
 
 I got a crush
 Copy shop clerk
 But she won't look up at me
 Don't want to be known as the freak
 Who just comes around to catch her eye
 
 We could be sleeping in the flowers
 We could sleep all afternoon
 You'd proclaim that you're an island
 I'd proclaim that I'm one too
 Then we float into the harbor
 With just piers and boats around
 I declare that I am England
 You declare that I have drowned
 
 I got a ride
 Home with a drunk guy
 How ungrateful I must have seemed
 He showed me how
 To spin my head round and round
 
 We could be sleeping in the flowers
 We could sleep all afternoon
 You'd proclaim that you're an island
 I'd proclaim that I'm one too
 Then we float into the harbor
 With just piers and boats around
 I declare that I am England
 You declare that I have drowned
 
 We could be sleeping in the flowers

 You'd proclaim that you're an island

 I declare that I am England
 You declare that I have drowned
 
 We'll be sleeping in the flowers
 Tell my boss that I've been fired
 We'll be sleeping in the flowers
 Tell my boss that I've been fired
 We'll be sleeping in the flowers
 Tell my boss I'm fired
 We'll be sleeping in the flowers
 Tell my boss I'm fired
 
 See them over there
 See them moving down the road
 Their arms held out ahead
 And their eyes, their eyes are closed
 
 Don't make any noise, cry out loud, or stamp your feet
 You'll wake the girls and boys who are walking in their sleep
 
 Every night they throw aside their blankets
 Swing their feet down, stand up, and move out to the street
 Like they're under a spell and together they roam across the country
 And they're walking in their sleep
 
 You'll recognize them when you see their rumpled hair and stocking feet
 It seems like they want something but we don't know what it is
 But here they come again
 Yes here they come again
 
 Move aside and let the people go by
 They don't see you thinking that they're home in their beds
 They must not be disturbed when they're wandering all across the country
 And they're walking in their sleep
 
 Perhaps when they awake they'll remember everything
 They'll think it was a dream
 It will be forgotten then
 
 But don't make any noise, cry out loud, or stamp your feet
 You'll wake the girls and boys who are walking in their sleep
 
 Sir hand
 Or is it ma'am
 I fell out of my right place again
 And you
 Considered me
 And now I'm where a snail has to be
 
 I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
 I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
 
 Was it something you would do for anybody?
 Was it what you'd only do for me?
 I need to know because you see
 I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
 
 Friend
 Look what you gave
 And how can you ever be repaid?
 How may I give you a hand
 From the position at your feet where I stand?
 
 So let me thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
 I'd like to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
 
 Was it something you would do for anybody?
 Was it what you'd only do for me?
 I need to know because you see
 I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
 
 Snail Shell
 Thank you
 Snail Shell
 Thank you
 
 Ah
 Ah
 Ah
 
 Was it something you would do for anybody?
 Was it what you'd only do for me?
 Or was it something where you acted when you saw the need
 And knew that there would be a way the act could be repaid
 And so it may, but for today
 I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
 
 Avalanche or roadblock
 I was a snowball in hell
 Avalanche or roadblock
 A jailer trapped in his cell
 
 Money's all broke, and food's going hungry
 If it wasn't for disappointment
 I wouldn't have any appointments
 
 Side effect or drug trip
 Don't tease me with all of your might
 Side effect or drug trip
 My panacea's in a Xerox shop
 
 Have a nice day, you want it when?
 Have a nice day, have a nice day
 
 I didn't expect to find a salesman drinking coffee this late in the morning. 
 How long you been here, Joe?
 Oh, I don't know, I guess thirty, forty-five minutes maybe. 
 Why do you ask?
 You must be making a lot of sales, piling up good income.
 Oh, uh, I'm doing all right. I could do better, but
 Oh haha I get it Paul. 
 Back on that old "Time is Money" kick, right?
 Not back on it, Joe, still on it.
 
 Avalanche or roadblock
 I was a snowball in hell
 Avalanche or roadblock
 A jailer trapped in his cell
 Money I owe, money-iy-ay
 Money I owe, money-iy-ay
 
 Avalanche or roadblock
 I was a snowball in hell
 
 Okay, okay
 Okay, okay, okay let's
 Okay, okay
 Okay, okay, okay let's
 Okay, okay
 Okay, okay, okay let's
 
 Avalanche or roadblock
 I was a snowball in hell
 Avalanche or roadblock
 A jailer trapped in his cell
 
 Money's all broke, and food's going hungry
 If it wasn't for disappointment
 I wouldn't have any appointments
 
 Did I affect your drug trip
 Don't tease me with all of your might
 Did I affect your drug trip
 You threw my wallet in the wishing well
 
 Have a nice day, you want it when?
 Have a nice day, have a nice day

 Mr. Horrible
 Mr. Horrible
 Telephone call for Mr. Horrible
 But before he can talk to the ugliness men
 There's some horrible business left
 For him to attend to
 Something unpleasant has spilled on his brain
 As he sponges it off they say
 
 "Is this Horrible?
 Is this Horrible?
 It's the ugliness men, Mr. Horrible
 We're just trying to bug you
 We thought that our dreadfulness
 Might be a thing to annoy you with"
 
 But Mr. Horrible says, "I don't mind
 The thing that bothers me is
 Someone keeps moving my chair"
 
 "Would you mind if we balance this glass of milk
 Where your visiting friend accidentally was killed?
 Would it be okay with you if we wrote a reminder
 Of things we'll forget to do today otherwise,
 Using a green magic marker, if it's alright
 On the back of your head?"
 
 Mr. Horrible
 Mr. Horrible
 We're not done with you yet Mr. Horrible
 You have to try on these pants so the Ugliness Men
 Can decide if they're just as embarrassing as we think
 We have to be sure about this
 
 But Mr. Horrible says, "I don't mind
 The thing that bothers me is
 Someone keeps moving my chair"
 
 Someone keeps moving my chair
 
 Mr. Horrible says, "I don't mind

 Not everyone you've abandoned
 Is still standing by
 Not everyone who is lost is
 Wondering why
 
 Sometimes a lonely way
 Taking your name down from the Jumbotron
 Find a new place to stay
 And a new home for the trumpeter swan
 
 We can see it now, the scratches
 On the back of the door
 We can see it now, no mistaking
 What you're better for
 
 Sometimes a lonely way
 Taken alive in an uncivil war
 Trophies and glass displays
 Rehearsals for third place, forever more
 
 Bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah 
 Bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah
 Bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah
 
 Not everyone you've abandoned
 Is still standing by
 Not everyone who is lost is
 Wondering why
 
 Sometimes a lonely way
 Taking your name down from the Jumbotron
 Find a new place to stay
 And a new home for the trumpeter swan
 
 Ladies and gentlemen

 I've been dragging my feet across my back
 And I've been rubbing my head against my neck
 And I've been walking my fingers through my mind
 And I've been feeling this feeling in my spine
 And I believe I'll be leaving it behind
 When I don't need a spine.
 
 Spines
 Gonna make you cry
 Gonna make you crawl
 Gonna make you fall in love again
 
 Spines
 Gonna make you beg
 Gonna make you scream
 Gonna make you fall in love with 
 Spines
 
 Down, down, down you go
 No way to stop
 As you fall, hear me call
 No, no, no
 Listen to this warning and
 Consider these
 Simple words of advice
 Stop, stop, stop
 
 Fogging the view, cupping face to the window
 In darkness you make out a spiraling shape
 Putting all reason aside you exchange
 What you got for a thing that's hypnotic and strange
 
 The spiraling shape will make you go insane
 
 But everyone wants to see that groovy thing
 
 And nobody knows what it's really like
 But everyone says it's great
 And they heard it from the spiral in their eyes
 
 This could lead to excellence
 Or serious injury
 Only one way to know
 Go, go, go
 Go ahead, wreck your life
 That might be good
 Who can say what's wrong or right?
 Nobody can
 
 Put out your hands and you fall through the window
 And clawing at nothing you drop through the void
 Your terrified screams are inaudible drowned
 In the spiral ahead and consumed in the shape
 
 The spiraling shape will make you go insane
 
 But everyone wants to see that groovy thing
 
 And now that you've tried it, you're back to report
 That the spiraling shape was a fraud and a fake
 You didn't enjoy it, you never believed it
 There won't be a refund, you'll never go back
 
 The spiraling shape will make you go insane
 
 But everyone wants to see that groovy thing
 
 And nobody knows what it's really like
 But everyone says it's great
 And they heard it from the spiral in their eyes
 
 Fogging the view, cupping face to the window
 In darkness you make out a spiraling shape
 Putting all reason aside you exchange
 What you got for a thing that's hypnotic and strange
 
 The spiraling shape will make you go insane
 
 But everyone wants to see that groovy thing
 
 Don't spend the rest of your life wondering
 
 Don't spend the rest of your life wondering
 
 Don't spend the rest of your life wondering
 
 Linnell:
 Here comes the last page
 All I need is an ending
 
 Nearing the end of the last page
 And the end of the whole book
 
 Yeah, what to do with these loose ends
 I should change the beginning
 But I shouldn't be typing
 While I'm driving
 While I'm making a phone call
 While I'm searching through the glove box
 While I'm writing it all down
 While it's happening
 
 They're gonna be so impressed
 When they get a load of me
 
 It's like I've got two extra pairs of hands
 Two to write, two to steer, one to scratch my head
 And one to cover my eyes which would help me to think up an end
 
 Yeah, some kind of punctuational mark
 Some kind of
 Some kind of
 Some kind of trouble up ahead
 What the hell
 What the hell
 
 Flansburgh:
 This truck is driving out of my mind
 But this truck has a mind of it's own
 Which is a lucky thing
 Because my leg is so short that I can't reach the break
 
 This truck is driving out of my mind
 But this truck has a mind of it's own
 Which is a lucky thing
 Because my leg is so short that I can't reach the break
 
 Something is nagging at me
 But never mind it's gone
 
 This truck can practically find its
 Own way without my help
 
 Maybe I should lie back and cover my eyes
 I think I'll do that
 
 Yeah, now I'm totally resting
 I'm reclining while I'm driving
 
 Why have I not tried this until now
 I'm letting go
 I'm letting go
 
 I see you from my spy plane, baby
 I see you walking on the ground
 I see you through my spy glasses, baby
 I can see right through the ground
 If you want to be a spy
 Then you must really see
 And you must really see
 If you want to be a spy like me
 
 Come on
 
 I might gaze on a submarine
 I see your face smiling at me
 Even when I close my eyes
 Your silhouette is smiling at me
 But you will never understand me
 Because I have a special job
 I wish I could break the spy glass
 Set it free
 So we could be
 
 Spy spy spy spy
 Spy spy spy spy
 Spy spy spy spy
 Spy spy spy spy

 I went for a walk on a stalk, on a stalk of wheat
 And it felt like a trillion feet
 I was looking for a friend at the end, at the end of the line
 And it took me till the end of time
 
 I was all out of luck like a duck, like a duck that died
 I was all out of juice like a moose, like a moose denied
 I was all out of money like a bunny that's broke
 I was all out of work like a jerk who's a joke
 And I was out of ideas, like I is, like I is,
 Like I is, like I is, I was out of ideas...of ideas
 
 I once had a dream of a gleam, of a gleam in my eye
 And I'll have it till the day I die
 I had a thought bubble of trouble, of trouble and strife
 And I'll have it for the rest of my life
 
 I was all out of luck like a duck, like a duck that died
 I was all out of juice like a moose, like a moose denied
 I was all out of money like a bunny that's broke
 I was all out of work like a jerk who's a joke
 And I was out of ideas like I is, like I is,
 Like I is, like I is, I was out of ideas, of ideas, of ideas, of ideas
 
 I like people, they're the ones who can't stand
 They're the ones who can't stand
 I see smoke signals coming from them
 They say "We are out of furniture"
 
 Stand on your own head for a change
 Give me some skin to call my own
 Stand on your own head for a change
 Give me some skin to call my own
 
 You made my day, now you have to sleep in it
 Now you have to sleep in it
 I love the world and if I have to sue for custody,
 I will sue for custody
 
 Stand on your own head for a change
 Give me some skin to call my own
 Stand on your own head for a change
 Give me some skin to call my own
 Stand on your own head
 Stand on your own head for a change
 Stand on your own head

 Vent these voices from the dark
 Shout Shout Shout Shout
 Scream it out
 Blast your missive
 Tell the wordless message
 Little stomp box

 Pour the poison in my ear
 Kill kill kill kill

 The stars got together and extinguished the moon and sun
 And they reigned forever in the night sky they had won
 The words assassinated the book
 The kitchen cooked and ate the cook
 
 Aw yeah, what is that certain je ne sais quoi?
 Aw yeah, it's a stone cold coup d''tat
 Stone cold coup d''tat
 Stone cold coup d''tat
 
 The orchestra conductor has been captured and tried and killed
 And the viola now occupies the throne that he formerly filled
 The bark now commands the trees
 The queen is overruled by the bees
 
 Aw yeah, it has a certain je ne sais quoi
 Aw yeah, it's a stone cold coup d''tat
 Stone cold coup d''tat
 Stone cold coup d''tat
 
 But if history is any guide
 It cannot be understood
 When you're not on the winning side
 
 Around the dinner table, a family says grace
 And the son sees the secret signal on his sister's face
 Dad smiles at his wife
 Daughter reaches for the knife
 
 Aw yeah, it has that certain je ne sais quoi
 Autumn leaves will burn 
 As the seasons turn 
 Nature's red in tooth and in claw
 
 Aw yeah, what is that certain je ne se quoi?
 Aw yeah, it's a stone cold coup d''tat
 Stone cold coup d''tat
 A stone cold coup d''tat
 
 Stormy pinkness
 Human weakness
 Fills my johnny cup with gloom
 Your progression

 Forty days this afternoon
 The things we cherish are small indeed
 So much the larger the need
 Stormy pinkness
 Set me thanklessly free

 As I got hit by a car there was a message for me
 As I went through the windshield, I noticed something
 
 Subliminal 
 In an unnoticeable way
 Important 
 And hard to see

 As I went through the pillow, I noticed something

 Girl! Why not take out the trash?
 And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again.
 Girl! Put that cat in the bin!
 After what he said, after everything he did.
 
 YOU had him figured out a while ago.
 And I know it's not exactly breaking news.
 But it's ALL been a little like a trial for you.
 And a bunch more talking won't make him true!
 Oh come on,
 
 Girl! Why not take out the trash?
 And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again.
 Girl! Why not give him the slip?
 Get the good, get straight, get the go-getter good and gone!
 
 Why? It's a claim that he's just making it up.
 And he still gotcha coming back for more.
 Why? You never ever think of breaking it up.
 Tell me why that deal's gonna close that door?
 Oh come on,
 
 Girl! Why not take out the trash?
 And once you get him out, tell him not to come back again.

 Tesla 
 Brought the X-ray photo to the world 
 Brought the AC power to the world 
 
 Here is a mind 
 That can see across space 
 Here is a mind soaring free 
 Sound turns to light 
 And light turns to waves 
 And waves turn to all things perceived 
 
 Maybe that knowledge would drive one insane 
 How can that knowledge be tamed? 
 
 Tesla 
 Ushered the radio wave into the world 
 Ushered the neon light 
 Into the world 
 
 The Hotel New Yorker 
 He's dead on the floor 
 The body of Nikola lies 
 With just his papers 
 No family to tell 
 Out of the windows birds fly 
 
 Under an X-ray of Mark Twain's skull 
 The plan for the death-ray's design 
 
 Tesla 
 Brought the radar detection to the world 
 Ushered remote control 
 Into the world 
 Ushered the bladeless turbine 
 Into the world 
 Ushered the neon light 
 Into the world
 
 The army's tired now
 Tired of swinging its giant arms

 Tired of waiting on the couch
 
 And it's so sad
 All its defenders have moved along
 
 And it's so sad
 The army's good times have all gone

 The bells are ringing
 The song they're singing
 The sound is bringing the people 'round
 They hear the instructions
 They follow directions
 They travel great distances to the sound
 
 The bells are ringing
 The song they're singing
 The sound is bringing the people 'round 
 
 They hear the instructions 
 They follow directions
 They travel great distances to the sound 
 
 They are persuaded by the music of the bells
 They're not responsible for anything they do
  The people know
  The way to go
 The bells are ringing, they hear the sound
 
 They hear the sound 
 They hear the sound 
 They hear the sound 
 They hear the sound
 
 The bells are ringing
 And everyone's walking
 With arms extended in a trance
 Forgetting their washing
 Neglecting the children
 They're dropping all businesses at hand
 
 A voice is telling them to act a different way
 They tilt their heads so they won't miss what it will say
  And when it's so
  There's this to know
 The bells are ringing, they hear the sound
 
 The bells are ringing
 The song they're singing
 The sound is bringing the people 'round
 They hear the instructions
 They follow directions
 They travel great distances to the sound
 
 They are persuaded by the music of the bells
 They're not responsible for anything they do
  The people know
  The way to go
 The bells are ringing, they hear the sound
 
 A girl with cotton in her ears
 Is shielded from the bells' effect
 As if by hidden signal
 The people turn to face her
 One thousand eyes are staring
 They pull away her earplugs
 
 The bells are pealing
 And they're revealing
 The simple key to happiness
 It isn't evil
 It isn't good
 It's only what the people miss
 
 The bells explain what they've been lacking all along
 They were disorganized and that was what was wrong
  And now they know
  The way to go
 The bells are ringing, they hear the sound
 
 The bells are ringing
 The song they're singing
 The sound is bringing the people 'round

 And the big big whoredom scared me
 
 No, no, baby I ain't convinced it ain't so bad as you paint it
 There's plenty more heads of hair for us out there
 We'll strike it rich, a monster switch 
 We'll strike it rich, a monster switch 
 We'll strike it rich, a monster switch 
 We'll strike it rich, a monster switch 
 
 But the big big whoredom scares me 
 The big big whoredom scares me 
 The big big whoredom scares me

 The water running down that pipe
 Looks like a snake to me
 By "Doc's Sugar Bowl" my coffee gets cold
 Because I don't want to see that
 I've got no one to blame but my fat self
 I've got no one to blame but my fat self
 I'm the biggest one
 I'm the biggest one
 I've got no one to blame but my fat self
 
 Should have changed that stupid lock
 Should have thrown away the key
 No, no, not I, I will survive
 Right down here on my knees 'cause
 I've got no one to blame but my fat self
 I've got no one to blame but my fat self
 I'm the biggest one
 I'm the biggest one
 I've got no one to blame but my fat self
 
 The Bloodmobile
 The Bloodmobile
 A delivery service inside us
 
 We begin in the heart's right ventricle
 And travel to the lungs
 Red blood cells get oxygen
 To take back to the heart
 Then from the left side of the heart
 And out to every cell
 Delivered by the Bloodmobile
 
 The food that's been digested
 Is waiting at the dock
 To be taken to the tissues
 In the body's grocery truck
 So from the small intestine
 It's carried everywhere
 Delivered by the Bloodmobile
 
 The Bloodmobile
 The Bloodmobile
 A delivery service inside us
 
 The white blood cells are soldiers
 That fight infectious germs
 They make the antibodies
 Their weapons in the fight
 The army is transported
 Wherever they must go
 Delivered by the Bloodmobile
 
 We need to send a message
 To tell a limb to grow
 Or speed the heart or regulate
 Your hunger or your sleep
 The hormones are the message
 They're sent from many glands
 The messenger's the Bloodmobile
 
 Somebody's got to haul out the trash
 To the liver and the kidneys
 It's not a pretty job
 Carbon dioxide gets carried
 To the lungs to be exhaled
 And the garbage truck is the Bloodmobile
 
 The Bloodmobile
 The Bloodmobile
 A delivery service inside us
 To carry oxygen, nutrients, things that fight infections
 Do the trash collection and deliver the mail
 And we're all 
 Delivered by the Bloodmobile
 
 The bright side is blinding our eyes
 And the sound keeps ringin', ringin'
 The bright side is just a white lie
 That the crowd keeps singin', singin'
 You are a busy bee
 You are a busy bee
 
 Sunshine, sitting on a pavement crack
 Everyone was staring back
 But you didn't mind
 Sunshine, futile were our defenses
 Backwards ran your sentences
 Until reeled the mind
 
 Next what's fear
 And silence in
 Wait just all we'll then
 Upside-down everything
 Turning done you're when
 
 The bright side is blinding our eyes
 And the sound keeps ringin', ringin'
 The bright side is just a white lie
 That the crowd keeps singin', singin'
 You are a busy bee
 You are a busy bee
 
 Back then, fighting with the permanent
 Pushing through the sediment
 Till we lost the trail
 Back then, those days felt like house arrest
 Half-awake and self-possessed
 We thought we'd prevail
 
 Among the rain
 And lights I saw
 The figure "5" in gold
 On a red firetruck
 That's what I was told
 
 The bright side is blinding our eyes
 And the sound keeps ringin', ringin'
 The bright side is just a white lie
 That the crowd keeps singin', singin'
 
 The bright side is blinding our eyes
 And the sound keeps ringin', ringin'
 
 Do you think there's somebody out there
 Someone else who's better than the one you've got?
 Well there's not, there's not
 
 When I talk you keep looking away from me
 Because you probably think that I'm high on pot
 But I'm not, I'm not
 
 Look me over I'm the Cap'm
 You say it's such a joke
 But I don't see you laughing
 
 People seem to think you can't be called the Cap'm
 Unless you drive a boat
 Well, I don't
 I don't
 
 Look me over I'm the Cap'm
 Go ahead and mess with me
 You'll find out what will happ'm
 
 Sit beside me at the helm
 Yeah, this is what I call the helm
 And this button here is the fast-forward button
 
 Did you say what I think you just said
 My hat looks good on me?
 I agree, I agree
 
 Look me over I'm the Cap'm
 You act like it's a joke, but I don't see you laughing
 
 People seem to think you can't be called the Cap'm
 Unless you drive a boat
 Well, I don't
 I don't
 
 I don't
 I don't
 I don't
 
 Yes, it's the darlings of Lumberland
 Their voices are the echoes' mausoleums turned to sand
 Empty hollow sockets freeze the soldiers where they stand
 The darlings of Lumberland
 
 It's getting difficult for a ghoul
 Wax museum dreams are so foolish
 No rehearsal, no finishing school
 It's getting difficult for a ghoul
 
 Hold my cold dead hand for a bit
 Just got my cast off, I'm gonna blast off
 A little melody if time permits
 Hold my cold dead hand for a bit
 
 Yes, it's the darlings of Lumberland
 Pull you off the bank and by popular demand
 Drag you by your mind, now you're under their command
 The darlings of Lumberland
 
 Yes, it's the darlings of Lumberland
 Their voices are the echoes' mausoleums turn to sand
 Empty hollow sockets freeze the soldiers where they stand
 The darlings of Lumberland
 
 The day Marvin Gaye and Phil Ochs got married
 The trees all waved their giant arms
 And happiness bled from every street corner
 And biplanes bombed with fluffy pillows

 The Edison Museum, not open to the public
 Its haunted towers rise into the clouds above it
 Folks drive in from out of town
 To gaze in amazement when they see it
 
 Just outside the gate I look into the courtyard
 Underneath the gathering thunderstorm
 Through the iron bars, I see the Black Maria
 Revolving slowly on its platform
 In the topmost tower, a light burns dim
 A coiling filament glowing within
 
 The Edison Museum, once a bustling factory
 Today is but a darkened, cobweb covered hive of industry
 The tallest, widest and most famous haunted mansion in New Jersey
 
 Behind a wooden door, the voice of Thomas Alva
 Recites a poem on a phonograph
 Ghosts float up the stair, like silent moving pictures
 The loyal phantoms of his in-house staff
 A wondrous place it is, there can be no doubt
 But no one ever goes in, and no one ever goes out
 
 So when your children quarrel and nothing seems to quell them
 Just tell them that you'll take them to the Edison Museum
 The largest independently owned and operated mausoleum
 
 There's a girl with a crown and a scepter
 Who's on WLSD
 And she says that the scene isn't what it's been
 And she's thinking of going home
 That it's old and it's totally over now
 And it's old and it's over, it's over now
 And it's over, it's over, it's over now
 I can see myself
 
 At the end of the tour
 When the road disappears
 If there's any more people around
 When the tour runs aground
 And if you're still around
 Then we'll meet at the end of the tour
 The engagements are booked through the end of the world
 So we'll meet at the end of the tour
 
 Never to part since the day we met
 Out on Interstate 91
 I was bent metal you were a flaming wreck
 When we kissed at the overpass
 I was sailing along with the people
 Driving themselves to distraction inside me
 Then came a knock on the door which was odd
 And the picture abruptly changed
 
 At the end of the tour
 When the road disappears
 If there's any more people around
 When the tour runs aground
 And if you're still around
 Then we'll meet at the end of the tour
 The engagements are booked through the end of the world
 So we'll meet at the end of the tour
 
 This was the vehicle these were the people
 You opened the door and expelled all the people
 This was the vehicle these were the people
 You opened the door and expelled all the people
 This was the vehicle these were the people
 You let them go
 
 At the end of the tour
 When the road disappears
 If there's any more people around
 When the tour runs aground
 And if you're still around
 Then we'll meet at the end of the tour
 The engagements are booked through the end of the world
 So we'll meet at the end of the tour
 And we're never gonna tour again
 No, we're never gonna tour again
 
 The famous person wears the same size water skis as me
 She's got three cars, as many years I've lived in this city
 Her hair is blond and mine is brown, they both start with a be	
 But when the phone inside her rib cage rings it's not for me
 But when the phone inside her rib cage rings it's not for me
 Hey
 
 They call me the greatest
 'Cause I'm not very good
 And they're being sarcastic
 They're being sarcastic
 
 Oh, I'm taking names
 But I'm not doing much
 With the names that I'm taking
 
 G-O-A-T
 They're being sarcastic
 They're being sarcastic
 
 They call me the greatest
 But those tears can be quiet
 So I listen close
 I listen close
 Yes I'm taking notes
 But those notes aren't helping
 The ink washes away
 
 G-O-A-T
 It washes away
 It washes away
 
 Hey,
 Who's that playing?
 Hey,
 The guitar?
 Is it Jim? I don't know
 Is it Jim? I don't know
 In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the lion takes control,
 In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the lion takes control,
 Hey,
 Who's that playing?
 Hey,
 The guitar?
 Hush my darling, be still my darling, the lion's on the phone,
 Hush my darling, be still my darling, the lion's on the phone,
 
 Hush my darling, be still my darling,
 Hey,
 Hush my darling, be still my darling
 Hey
 
 Turn it up
 The guitar
 I can't hear, the guitar
 
 In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the lion waves goodbye
 In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the lion waves goodbye
 
 Hey,
 Who's that playing?

 The guitar?

 Hush my darling, be still my darling,

 Hush my darling, be still my darling
 Hey
 
 Turn it up
 The guitar
 I can't hear, the guitar
 
 In the spaceship, the silver spaceship, the lion waves goodbye

 Hey,

 I can't hang out with the haunted eye
 though I don't know why. -repeat-
 
 I was born in a crypt a hundred years ago
 A spider was my mom.
 Working as shill in a traveling show
 til I killed someone.
 
 I can't hang out with the haunted eye
 though I don't know why.  -repeat-
 
 There's a house at the top of a tree
 There's a house at the top of a tree
 In the house there's a room
 In the room there's a chair
 And sitting in the chair is you
 
 There's a nose at the end of a snout
 Of a dog with his head out the window
 Of a car that's driving away from the tree
 And at the top of a tree there's a house
 And in the house there's a room and in the room
 There's a chair and in the chair is you
 
 There's a plan to eat the house
 In the mind of a mouse in the woods
 And the mouse in the woods has a smell that's detected
 By the nose at the end of a snout of a dog
 And the dog has his head out the window of a car
 And the car is driving away from the tree
 And at the top of a tree there's a house
 And in the house there's a room and in the room
 There's a chair and in the chair is you
 
 There are no more potato chips left
 In the empty bag in your hand
 And the crumpling sound of the empty bag
 Makes the mice get mad
 And when the mice get mad
 It leads to a plan to eat the house
 And the plan's in the mind of the mouse in the woods
 And the mouse in the woods has a smell that's detected
 By the nose at the end of a snout of a dog
 And the dog has his head out the window of a car
 And the car is driving away from the tree
 And at the top of a tree there's a house
 And in the house there's a room and in the room
 There's a chair and in the chair is you
 
 And the reason there are no more chips
 In the empty bag in your hand
 Is that the crumpling sound of the empty bag
 Makes the mice get mad
 Which leads to a plan
 To eat the house
 But just in time
 The dog arrives
 To give to the mouse
 The potato chips
 That you took from the bag
 And gave to the dog
 To deliver to the mouse
 So the mouse would not eat you
 
 The lady said to the tiger as they stood behind some doors,
 "I'm sick of this job; I don't know what we're waiting here for.
 I'm turning off life support.  I'm putting an end to this joke."
 The tiger thought about this and then the tiger spoke.
 
 "Starving the beast, at the very least, will just increase its hunger.
 Go right ahead and starve me dead.  It will only make me stronger.
 
 The lady said, "I'm busting out of this prison.
 I've got laser vision, and I'm burning a hole in the wall."
 The tiger said, "Wait, you'll start a fire,
 Destroy the entire lady and the tiger hall."
 
 "Felines and dames in flames will hardly serve your aims.
 Do you surmise it's wise to have laser beams emitting from your eyes?"
 
 "Point taken, cat; I can well see that our lives are worth protecting,
 But i submit it's time we quit this hoping and expecting."
 
 "Felines and dames in flames will hardly serve my aims,
 But in my dreams it seems that my eyes are always shooting laser beams"
 
 The hall remains; it still contains a pair of doors, a choice.
 Behind one door, a muffled roar; behind the other, a voice.
 
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Tramp
 
 Look what you've done,
 You gigolo.
 You know that I loved you, hon,
 And I didn't want to know
 That your cool,
 Seductive serenade
 Was a tool
 Of your trade,
 You gigolo.
 
 Of all the riches you've surveyed,
 And all that you can lift,
 I'm just another dollar that you made
 In your long, long grift.
 
 Look what you've done,
 You gigolo.
 Another hustle has been run,
 But now you ought to know
 That this fool
 Can no longer be swayed
 By the tools
 Of your trade,
 You gigolo.
 
 I'm just another john you've gypped,
 Another sucker stiffed,
 Just a walk on role in the script
 To your long, long grift.
 The love that had me in your grip
 Was just a long, long grift.
 
 We've been driving around
 From one end of this town to the other and back
 But no one's ever seen us 
 Driving our Econoline van 
 And no one's ever heard of our band
 
 We're the Mesopotamians
 Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal, and Gilgamesh
 
 Then they wouldn't understand a word we say,
 So we'll scratch it all down into the clay
 Half believing there will sometime come a day
 Someone gives a damn
 Maybe when the concrete has crumbled to sand
 
 We're the Mesopotamians
 Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal, and Gilgamesh
 
 The Mesopotam-ish sun is beating down
 And making cracks in the ground
 But there's nowhere else to stand
 In Mesopotamia, 
 The kingdom where we secretly reign 
 The land where we invisibly rule
 
 As the Mesopotamians
 Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal, and Gilgamesh
 
 This is my last stick of gum
 I'm going to cut it up so everybody else gets some
 Except for Ashurbanipal who says my haircut makes me look like a Mohenjo-daroan
 
 Hey, Ashurbanipal,
 I'm a Mesopotamian
 Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal, and Gilgamesh
 
 We're the Mesopotamians
 Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal, and Gilgamesh
 
 "Hey, man, I thought that you were dead
 I thought you crashed your car"
 "No, man, I've been right here this whole time playing bass guitar
 For the Mesopotamians"
 
 We're the Mesopotamians
 Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal
 Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal, and Gilgamesh
 
 We're the Mesopotamians
 Sargon, Hammurabi, Ashurbanipal, and Gilgamesh
 
 The secret life of six
 Means having fun
 When everyone's inside
 He's in the sun
 
 Six knows how to stand on his head
 Six knows how to stand on his head
 Six knows how to stand on his head
 Six knows how to stand on his head
 
 And when six pretends he's nine
 He acts older and older
 And when six pretends he's nine
 He wears wiser disguises
 
 The secret life of nine
 Means having fun
 When everyone's inside
 He's in the sun
 
 Nine knows how to stand on his head
 Nine knows how to stand on his head
 Nine knows how to stand on his head
 Nine knows how to stand on his head
 
 And when nine pretends he's six
 He acts sunny and funny
 And when nine pretends he's six
 He announces, he bounces
 
 Driving home from my meth lab
 Realized something had changed
 Looked in the sky
 Saw with my eye
 The moon was following me
 
 Where's the shadow government when you need it?
 Where's the shadow government?
 It's a bad, bad world
 It's a bad, bad world
 
 Sifting through the confetti,
 I picked up my broken phone
 Looked in the crack
 Somebody waved back
 Just sitting on their somebody throne
 
 Where's the shadow government when you need it?
 Where's the shadow government?
 It's a bad, bad world
 It's a bad, bad
 
 Up the library steps
 Up the library steps
 Up the library steps
 Up the library steps
 Up the library steps 
 Up the library steps 
 Up the library steps 
 Up the library steps
 
 Crawling out of the flophouse,
 I saw the mayor stealing my junk
 I doth protest, citizen's arrest
 Now my body's in his trunk
 
 Where's the shadow government when you need it?
 Where's the shadow government?
 It's a bad, bad world
 It's a bad, bad world
 It's a bad, bad
 
 The statue got me high
 The statue got me high
 The monument of granite sent a beam into my eye
 The statue made me die
 The statue made me die
 It took my hand it killed me and it turned me to the sky
 
 The stone it called to me
 
 A rock that spoke a word
 
 And though I once preferred a human being's company
 They pale before the monolith that towers over me
 
 The statue got me high
 The statue got me high
 The truth is where the sculptor's chisel chipped away the lie
 The statue made me fry
 The statue made me fry
 My coat contained a furnace where there used to be a guy
 
 The stone it called to me
 
 A rock that spoke a word
 
 And as the screaming fire engine siren filled the air
 The evidence had vanished from my charred and smoking chair
 And what they found was just a statue
 Standing where the statue got me high
 And what they found was just a statue
 Standing where the statue got me high
 
 And now it is your turn
 
 The stone it calls to you
 
 And as the screaming fire engine siren fills the air
 The evidence will vanish from your charred and smoking chair
 And what they found was just a statue
 Standing where the statue got me high
 And what they'll find is just a statue
 Standing where the statue got you high
 
 A I why, O E you
 We're the Vowel Family, and we've come to sing for you
 
 Vowels are important letters, there's a vowel in every word
 Vowels are important letters, there's a vowel in every word
 Ask someone older to show you, there's a vowel in each word
 Vowels are important letters, there's a vowel in every word
 
 A I why, O E you
 We're the Vowel Family, and we're back to sing some more
 
 A is an important letter
 Well I is important too
 Why is an important letter
 Well O is important too
 E is an important letter
 O is an important letter
 
 Vowels are important letters, there's a vowel in every word
 Ask someone older to show you, there's a vowel in each word
 Vowels are important letters, yes, vowels are in every word
 
 I'm trapped in a world before later on,
 I'm trapped in a world before later on,
 
 Where's my hovercraft?
 Where's my jet pack?
 Where's the font of acquired wisdom that eludes me now?
 
 We're trapped in a world before later on,
 We're trapped in a world before later on,
 
 Where's our tel ray?
 Where's our space face?
 Where are all the complications we won't see around?
 
 I know you deceived me, couldn't sleep last night
 Now my tear stains on the wall reflect an ugly sight
 I can see your secrets
 No need to confess
 Everyone looks naked when you know the world's address
 
 The world's address
 A place that's worn
 A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
 I'll repeat it for those who may not have already guessed
 The world's address
 
 Life's parade of fashion just leaves me depressed
 Under every garment I can see the world's address
 Call the men of science and let them hear this song
 Tell them Albert Einstein and Copernicus were wrong
 
 The world's address
 A place that's worn
 A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
 I'll repeat it for those who may not have already guessed
 The world's address
 
 Call the men of science and let them hear this song
 Tell them Albert Einstein and Copernicus were wrong
 
 The world's address
 A place that's worn
 A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
 I'll repeat it for those who may not have already guessed
 
 The world's address
 A place that's worn
 A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
 I'll say it one more time for those who may not have already guessed
 The world's address
 
 Why is the world in love again?
 Why are we marching hand in hand?
 Why are the ocean levels rising up?
 It's brand new record for 1990.
 They Might be Giants' brand new album:
 Flood
 
 There's a great big beautiful tomorrow
 Shining at the end of every day
 There's a great big beautiful tomorrow
 And tomorrow's just a dream away
 
 Man has a dream and that's the start
 He follows his dream with mind and heart
 And when it becomes a reality
 It's a dream come true for you and me
 
 So there's a great big beautiful tomorrow
 Shining at the end of every day
 There's a great big beautiful tomorrow
 Just a dream away
 
 When the hands that operate the motor lose control of the lever
 When the mind of its own in the wheel puts two and two together
 When the indicator says you're out of oil should you continue driving anyway?
 There's a thermostat that regulates the temperature
 That might not be reliable
 That should be disconnected
 
 Turn it up, turn it down
 Turn it up when the cold brings you down
 When the heat bothers you turn it down
 Turn it up, turn it down
 
 As I was just saying
 As I was just saying
 As I was just telling you a minute ago
 
 I was just talking and someone interrupted
 Or was it a loud explosion?
 Or is the thermostat engulfed in flames
 Or is it just me?
 
 Turn it up, turn it down
 Turn it up when the cold brings you down
 When the heat bothers you turn it down
 Turn it up, turn it down
 
 As I was just saying
 As I was just saying
 As I was just saying
 
 Turn it up, turn it down
 Turn it up when the cold brings you down
 When the heat bothers you turn it down
 Turn it up, turn it down
 
 Turn it up, turn it down
 Turn it up when the cold brings you down
 When the heat bothers you turn it down
 Turn it up, turn it down
 
 Julie at the station says They'll be here any minute now
 But she's running out of records and her show is ending anyhow.
 They can hear her saying Their name on the car radio
 But the signal keeps fading out no matter which way They go.
 I heard They Might Be somewhere in this town
 They Might Be Giants got lost driving around
 
 John said to John, I think we make a left at the light
 There should be a big crinkle, assuming this map is right
 John looked over and said, Hey, no its not
 It's a crumpled up wrapper from the fast food that we got
 I heard They Might Be somewhere in this town
 They Might Be Giants got lost driving around
 
 Dan said to Hal, "I see somebody walking this way"
 So They rolled down the window and said, "Hello. Hey excuse me, hey"
 "Could you tell us where we are and the best way out of here"
 They could tell from his expression he had absolutely no idea
 I heard They Might Be somewhere near this town
 They Might Be Giants got lost driving around
 Driving around
 Driving around
 They're still driving around
 
 Hang on
 Hang on tight
 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants
 They might be rain
 They might be heat
 They might be frying up a stalk of wheat
 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants
 They might be brain
 They might be washed
 They might be Dr. Spock's back-up band
 
 To make the merry-go-round go faster
 So that everyone needs to hang on tighter
 Just to keep from being thrown to the wolves
 
 Tabloid footprints in your hair
 Tabloid footprints everywhere
 We can't be silent
 'Cause they might be giants
 And what are we going to do unless they are
 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants
 They might be bald
 They might be snow
 They might be something else in the snow
 
 Hang on tight
 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants
 They might be fake
 They might be lies
 They might be big, big, fake, fake lies
 
 Tabloid footprints in your hair
 Tabloid footprints everywhere
 We can't be silent
 'Cause they might be giants
 And what are we going to do unless they are
 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 They might be giants 
 
 Love sees love's happiness
 But happiness can't see that love is sad
 That love is sad
 Sadness is hanging there
 To show love somewhere something needs a change
 They need a change
 
 They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
 To take the house he built for her apart
 To make it break it's gonna take a metal ball hung from a chain
 They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
 To pick the broken ruins up again
 To mend her heart, to help him start to see a world apart from pain
 
 Lad's gal is all he has
 Gal's gladness hangs upon the love of lad
 The love of lad
 Some things gal says to lad aren't meant as bad
 But cause a little pain
 They cause him pain
 
 They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
 To take the house he built for her apart
 To make it break it's gonna take a metal ball hung from a chain
 They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
 To pick the broken ruins up again
 To mend her heart, to help him start to see a world apart from pain
 
 Don't call me at work again no no the boss still hates me
 I'm just tired and I don't love you anymore
 And there's a restaurant we should check out where
 The other nightmare people like to go
 I mean nice people, baby wait,
 I didn't mean to say nightmare
 
 Lad looks at other gals
 Gal thinks Jim Beam is handsomer than lad
 He isn't bad
 Call off the wedding band
 Nobody wants to hear that one again
 Play that again
 
 They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
 To take the house he built for her apart
 To make it break it's gonna take a metal ball hung from a chain
 They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
 To pick the broken ruins up again
 To mend her heart, to help him start to see a world apart from pain
 
 They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
 They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
 They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
 They'll need a crane, they'll need a crane
 They'll need a crane
 
 Selflessly hiding all emotions inside
 Chilly and dry, New England style
 Nobody's figured out my twelve fatal flaws
 Who's keeping score? Who wins that war?
 I'm busting out
 And I know everyone agrees
 
 Caring is carting bad ideas to the dump
 And taking my time, taking my time
 Hey, this microphone was turned on all along
 
 I tried returning all that stuff to the store
 But then I bought more, then I bought more
 I'm done explaining all these reckless displays
 Hard to defend, I'm in a haze
 Old stories told
 In brand-new clothes I bought today
 
 Kindness is killing off my unfinished dreams
 And walking away, just walking away
 Hey, this microphone was turned on all along
 
 Caring is carting bad ideas to the dump
 And taking my time, taking my time
 Hey, this microphone was turned on all along
 
 The Monochrome Martinet
 His texture is starch
 The song is a march
 And from the beginning
 His duende was winning
 But though he's a worthy emcee
 He'll never be part of the three
 Orpheum act
 Faustian pact
 Three might be duende in fact
 
 Necropolis Blownapart
 A ghostly sight emerges bright
 Hot from the embers the first team member
 Is hatching a dastardly plan
 Like a bird with a dastardly egg
 Trapped in this time
 Lost in his rhymes
 One might be duende defined
 
 Apocryphal Espadrille
 The shaper of dreams returns to the scene
 No diorama could match his drama
 A smile that would frighten the blind
 The incubus freezes the mind
 Right off the farm
 Fooled by his charm
 Sound might be duende's alarm
 
 Dystopio Smashedtobits
 The keeper of dust the builder of rust
 When you discover sleep's older brother
 The trio is finally complete
 The trio has just one conceit
 Forged by their past
 First in their class
 Three might be duende
 Three might be duende
 Three might be duende at last
 
 We're through being cool
 We're through being cool
 Eliminate the ninnies and the twits
 Gotta go to the moon
 Too late to be a clone
 Time to show the in crowd that it's out
 
 If you live in a small town
 You might meet a dozen or two
 Young alien types who step out
 And dare to declare
 
 We're through being cool
 We're through being cool
 Spank the pank who try to drive you nuts
 Time to clean some house
 Be a man or a mouse
 Chase those who make it tough to get around
 
 If you live in a big place
 Many factions underground
 Chase down mister hinky dink
 So no trace can be found
 
 If you live in a big place
 Many factions underground
 Chase down mister hinky dink

 Eliminate the ninnies and the twits
 
 Put the tape on erase
 Rearrange your place
 We always liked Picasso anyway

 I know, I know, I said that I would quit
 All right, I promise, no more after this
 You don't know how I've tried
 To forget what it was like
 
 I remember now
 I remember now
 Why they called it Thunderbird
 Why they called it Thunderbird
 
 Man, oh man, my throat is dry
 Man, are you thinking what I
 Am? Well what about it then?
 
 Before you fall, you have to learn to crawl
 You can't see heaven when you're standing tall
 To get the whole sky
 On the ground you have to lie
 
 I remember now
 I remember now
 Why they called it Thunderbird
 Why they called it Thunderbird
 
 We like fun, me and my girl
 We'll have fun fun fun until
 T-bird takes her dad away
 
 I know, I know, I said that I'd desist
 All right, I promise, no more after this
 Not to be what I was like
 Not to soar across the sky
 Spread my thunder wings and fly
 Spread my thunder wings and fly
 
 I remember now
 I remember now
 Why they called it Thunderbird
 Why they called it Thunderbird
 
 If it wasn't for that tick
 We would not be in this predicament
 Not be in this predicament that we're in
 
 She's rippin' strips of flesh from the prey beneath her paws 
 After work she gets the polish out and paints 'em pretty claws 
 
 Tigerella  Is makin' me yowl 
 That's some jungle kitty cat Got me on the prowl 
 
 Shoppin' for an outfit she can wear tonight 
 Don't get between her and that food she wants or she may bite 
 
 Tigerella  Is makin' me yowl 
 That's some jungle kitty cat Got me on the prowl  
 Reooowwwwww 
 
 Tigerella Is makin' me yowl 
 That's some jungle kitty cat Got me on the prowl 
 Ahhhhhhhh
 
 There were 87 Advil in the bottle now there's 30 left
 I ate 47 so what happened to the other 10?
 Why do you suspiciously change the subject and break my concentration
 As I dump the bottle out and I count the Advil up again?
 
 Don't interrupt me as I struggle to complete this thought
 Have some respect for someone more forgetful than yourself
 
 And I'm not done
 And I won't be till my head falls off
 
 Hitting every pocket on my shirt, pants and overcoat
 And I'm hitting them again but I don't know where I put my notes
 Clearing my throat, and gripping the lectern I smile and face my audience
 Clearing his throat and smiling with his hands on the bathroom sink
 
 And when I lean my head against the frosted shower stall
 I see stuff through the glass that I don't recognize at all
 
 And I'm not done
 And I won't be till my head falls off
 Though it may not be a long way off
 
 I'm not done talking yet
 I'm not done talking yet
 
 And when I lean my head against the frosted shower stall
 I see a broken figure silhouetted on the wall
 
 And I'm not done
 And I won't be till my head falls off
 Though it may not be a long way off
 I won't be done until my head falls off
 
 Oh who has heard the great commotion, motion motion
 all the country through?
 It is the ball a-rolling on
 for Tippecanoe and Tyler too
 and with him we'll beat Little Van, Van
 Van is a used up man
 and with him we'll beat Little Van
 
 Sure, let 'em talk about hard cider 
 and log cabins too
 't'will only help to speed the ball 
 for Tippecanoe and Tyler too
 and with him we'll beat Little Van, Van
 Van is a used up man
 and with him we'll beat Little Van
 
 Like the rush of mighty waters 
 onward it will go
 And of course we'll bring you through
 for Tippecanoe and Tyler too
 and with him we'll beat Little Van, Van
 Van is a used up man
 and with him we'll beat Little Van
 
 In the mornin' sun 'round seven o'clock
 The parking lot fills around Toys-are-Us
 And my little girl, she will get away
 Ride her bike down Toddler Hiway
 Take your Close'n'Play
 Toddler Hiway
 
 The token back to Brooklyn fell between the grating
 And we're just watching it sinking
 The fare went up to one hundred dollars
 And we can never go home again
 The bill collector's drinking lighter fluid
 And says he'll tell our parents
 Our feet start running at a furious pace
 But we can't get away
 
 Oh oh oh oh oh
 Oh oh oh oh oh
 
 Fall in love with the too-tall girl
 Deleterious and delirious
 Fall in love with the too-tall girl
 With her magazine
 Dressed in aubergine
 
 Too-tall girl can see
 Past the rooftops and the trees
 Too-tall girl can see
 Past the crosstown mall and townie sprawl
 
 There's no kind of guidebook or catalogue
 There's no kind of parallel or analogue
 Soon you'll just be playing some tag-along
 In the world of a girl in a too-tall fog
 
 Bah bah bah bah bah bah
 Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah
 Bah bah bah bah bah bah
 Bah bah bah bah bah bah
 
 Fall in love with the too-tall girl
 Whispers pretty tones in a megaphone
 Fall in love with the too-tall girl
 Knows more etiquette
 Than Connecticut
 
 Too-tall girl can see
 Past the rooftops and the trees
 Too-tall girl can see
 Past the crosstown mall and townie sprawl
 
 To get to her a boy's got to calculate
 To get to her a boy's got to estimate
 All the walls to clear and the hills to climb
 As the months turn to days in this too-tall time
 
 Rabbits have two eyes
 And whales have two eyes
 And eagles have two eyes
 But triops has three eyes
 Triops has three eyes
 
 Two eyes on a face
 Are usually enough
 But triops has got
 One that looks up
 
 And one that looks around
 And one to keep an eye
 On the other pair of guys
 Triops has three eyes
 
 Needles have an eye
 Tornadoes have an eye
 Potatoes have a lot of eyes
 But triops has three eyes
 Triops has three eyes
 
 Everything with eyes
 Has some amount of eyes
 And triops has got
 One that looks up
 
 And one that looks around
 And one to keep an eye
 On the other pair of guys
 Triops has three eyes
 
 There are two sides to every story
 But triangles have three
 And the tricycle has one more cycle
 Than the washing machine
 
 Chickens have two legs
 And varmin  have two legs
 And monkeys have two legs
 But tripods have three legs
 Tripods have three legs
 
 They've got more than you
 'cause they need more than two
 A tripod has got
 One that points back
 
 And one that sticks out
 And one to be a friend
 To the other pair of legs
 Tripods have three legs
 
 Look, there's an eye
 Hey, there's another eye
 And there's a third eye
 'cause triops has three eyes
 Triops has three eyes
 
 Two eyes on a face
 Are usually enough
 But triops has got
 One that looks up
 
 And one that looks around
 And one to keep an eye
 On the other pair of guys
 Triops has got
 
 One that points back
 And one that sticks out
 And one to be a friend
 To the other pair of guys
 
 Triops has three eyes
 Triops has three eyes
 Triops has three eyes
 
 Erstwhile and estranged
 I know I'm one in a long chain
 I came to get my mini-bike returned
 
 Same old bad times
 I know they're one in a long line
 I came to get my mini-bike returned
 
 And I know there's truth in your words
 Buried inside of your words
 Yeah I've learned a thing or two
 from hard times spent with you
 
 And I know there's truth in your words
 Buried inside of your words
 Yeah I've learned a thing or two
 From hard times spent with you
 
 I was working all night in my office
 When a man I had recently killed
 Called me up from a phone near my building
 So I looked out the window at him
 He had the same obsequious manner
 That was the reason I had him killed
 So to calm my nerves I sang this song
 To him, over the phone
 
 Turn around, turn around
 There's a thing there that can be found
 Turn around, turn around
 It's a human skull on the ground
 Human skull on the ground
 Turn around
 
 I was out by myself in the graveyard
 I was doing an interpretive dance
 When I felt something heavy and pointed
 Strike me in the back of the neck
 And then the ghost of my dance instructor
 Pushed me down into an open grave
 And as dirt rained down she played a xylophone
 And sang me this song
 
 Turn around, turn around
 There's a thing there that can be found
 Turn around, turn around
 It's a human skull on the ground
 Human skull on the ground
 Turn around
 
 We were waving our arms out the window
 Of a fast moving passenger train
 Acting in an irresponsible fashion
 Until the engineer whose back had been turned
 And who we thought would find us highly amusing
 Quickly swiveled his head around
 And his face which was a paper-white mask of evil
 Sang us this song
 
 Turn around,  turn around 
 There's a thing there that can be found 
 Turn around,  turn around 
 It's a human skull on the ground 
 Human skull  on the ground 
 Turn around 
 
 Turn around,  turn around 
 There's a thing there that can be found 
 Turn around,  turn around 
 It's a human skull on the ground 
 Human skull  on the ground 
 Turn around 
 
 Turtle songs of North America:
 
 Put an ear out the back window. There's a sound coming from the pond or the woods that might remind you of a broken train whistle, or the quiet whisper of two leaves having a quarrel over who will pay the bill, or it may sound to you like something that isn't a sound at all, like the texture of ants on a log or the blinding taste of sunlight on the hood of a truck.
 
 Following are some of the most familiar and some of the rarest songs heard from a great variety of North American turtles:
 
 Eastern Fighting Turtle.
 
 The aggressive snarl of the Eastern Fighting Turtle can carry for up to 5 miles across still water. Even this is not a safe distance away, for this turtle is a very fast swimmer and will attack without provocation.
 
 Tudlow.
 
 On a summer evening, the song of the Tudlow can be heard; its characteristic gasping is both a mating call and a cry for help. The number of gasps follows the Fibonacci sequence, often reaching as high as 55 or 89 gasps before the animal loses consciousness.
 
 Downy Tortuga.
 
 The song of the Downy Tortuga can be easily recognized, for it seems to be repeating the word unclean. Unclean.
 
 Zombie Turtle.
 
 The beautiful call of the Zombie Turtle is said to hypnotize her mate for up to an hour. Human listeners are likewise entranced, often forgetting responsibilities and losing muscular control.
 
 Mudflail.
 
 The Mudflail is identifiable both by its song and by the strong odor that emanates from its shell, which is in a constant state of decomposition. Its soft and rancid body is both a weakness and a natural protection against predators.
 
 She set your goldfish free
 And now she's sighing
 Blew out your pilot light
 And made a wish
 
 She doesn't have to have
 Her DB's record back now
 But there's not a lot of things
 That she'll take back
 
  She wants to see you again
  She wants to see you again
 Slowly twisting 
 In the wind 
 Twisting twisting 
 In the wind
 
 She's not your satellite
 She doesn't miss you
 So turn off your smoke machine
 And Marshall stack
 
 She doesn't have to have
 Her Young Fresh Fellows tape back now
 But there's not a lot of things
 That she'll take back
 
  She wants to see you again
  She wants to see you again
 Slowly twisting 
 In the wind 
 Twisting twisting 
 In the wind
 
  She wants to see you again
  She wants to see you again
 Slowly twisting 
 In the wind 
 Twisting twisting 
 In the wind
 
 Underwater woman
 Underwater lady
 No one on the shore will ever know what's in her heart
 
 Fiercely alive, will to survive
 Able to thrive on her own
 Self contained, properly trained
 Hydroponically grown
 
 Underwater woman
 Breathing underwater
 Brushing her hair, eating a pear
 No one can tell when she cries
 Away, away, away
 
 She scans the ocean floor
 With ultrasonic blips
 Nothing but rocks and sand
 And the broken wrecks of ships
 
 Underwater woman
 Underwater lady
 No one on the shore will ever know what's in her heart
 
 Laughing uncontrollably, who is she talking to?
 Holding up a shell like it's a telephone
 Frantically digging through a pile of old papers
 Intently staring at a photograph
 
 Underwater woman
 Breathing underwater
 Brushing her hair, eating a pear
 No one can tell when she cries
 Away, away, away
 
 Don't have to be
 Your only one
 Don't have to be
 Something from now on
 Don't have to be
 What I want at all
 
 Just have to be
 Unforgotten
 
 I know your new boyfriend
 And you belong with him
 The truth is my one regret
 The truth is my one regret
 
 Just have to be
 Unforgotten
 Just have to be
 Unforgotten
 
 Don't have to know
 What I'm thinking now
 Don't have to know
 Better days than these
 Don't have to know
 Where I've been so long
 
 Just have to be
 Unforgotten
 
 I know you're leaving now
 If I had figured out
 
 Just how to be
 Unforgotten
 Just how to be
 Unforgotten
 
 Time stopped
 When you said hello
 When you left
 The clock began to breathe again
 Now all I do is think about
 The puzzle that remains
 
 Your name it is unpronounceable
 Distorted and illegible
 I never figured out what that was
 If I couldn't then I doubt I ever will
 
 Rewind the tape, review the blur
 Never the same, but still obscure
 Turn up the sound and hear the white noise
 Zoom and enhance if that were even a
 
 Real thing
 Which it isn't
 Stare at the static long enough you'll
 Be hypnotized be hypnotized
 
 Now I spend
 My days and nights
 Looking at
 A depression on the sofa
 And over time it flattens out
 But I am still depressed
 
 Your name it is unpronounceable
 Distorted and illegible
 I never figured out what that was
 If I couldn't then I know I never will
 
 Rewind the tape, review the blur
 Never the same, but still obscure
 Turn up the sound and hear the white noise
 Stare at the static and be hypnotized
 
 Found
 Found your sound
 Wound down and nearly drowned
 Lying on the ground
 
 Your name it is unpronounceable
 Distorted and illegible
 I never figured out what that was
 If I couldn't then I know I never will
 
 Rewind the tape, review the blur
 Never the same, but still obscure
 Turn up the sound and hear the white noise
 Stare at the static and be hypnotized
 
 Do you smile 'cause I'm funny? said the man
 I wasn't joking and I meant the thing I said
 Not at all, not at all
 Said the woman to the man
 I was thinking of an unrelated thing
 
 Unconnected and free
 No relationship to anything
 
 How come you never look me in the eye?
 Aren't you listening to me said the man
 Not at all, not at all
 Said the woman to the man
 I'm still thinking of an unrelated thing
 
 Somewhere other than here
 Something else besides the man
 
 Please explain the expression on your face
 Then I'll know what's beneath it said the man
 No you won't, no you won't
 Said the woman to the man
 I'll be thinking of an unrelated thing
 I'll be thinking of an unrelated thing
 
 I hit my head
 I hear the phone ring
 I was distracted by my friend Joe 
 I hit my head
 Now I'm left-handed
 Lost my sublet to my friend Joe
 
 I've lost my superpowers 
 I was invisible
 I could just cut myself
 Right out my will
 I was unsupervised
 I had a real good time
 Until I . . . I hit my head
 
 Back in the day
 With my friends 'round me
 You could count on me with just one hand
 When I digress
 You'll find me smiling
 Could be living underneath the ground
 
 I've lost my superpowers
 I was invisible
 I could just cut myself
 Right out my will
 I was unsupervised
 I had a real good time
 Until I . . . I hit my head
 
 I hit my head
 In different places
 Was distracted by memory
 I was alone
 Or else just lonely
 And Joe will never return again
 
 I've lost my superpowers
 I was invisible
 I could just cut myself
 Right out my will
 I was unsupervised
 I had a real good time
 Until I . . .
 
 We hope for better things 
 That were impossible 
 We would just clap our hands 
 And wait for the sound 
 We were unsupervised 
 We had a real good time
 Until I . . . I hit my head
 
 You say you've got some very excellent news
 You say I'm going to die when you tell me
 And in my way, I will
 But though your words will kill,
 I know you'll think that I don't seem to care
 
 It's just because my frown is upside down
 It's upside down, my frown
 Is upside down
 
 I'm happy at your happiness as well
 Your anger makes me mad
 Though you can't tell
 Believe me when I say
 I'm with you in my private way
 And though you think I'm trying to blow you off
 
 It's only that my frown is upside down
 It's upside down, my frown
 Is upside down
 My frown's upside down
 
 You'd probably like to give me a smack
 But there's something about my face
 That always keeps you coming back
 
 When I'm with you, the landscape goes all weird
 Black is white, and the rainbow has a beard
 Are your eyes playing tricks
 Or should you get your glasses fixed?
 Well, I don't think your eyesight is to blame
 
 The problem is my frown is upside down
 It's upside down, my frown
 Is upside down
 My frown's upside down
 It's upside down, my frown
 Is upside down
 My frown's upside down
 
 She's a different kind of Girl
 The kind you see in pictures
 I think you might have seen her
 Richards on Richards
 
 You know what I mean
 You know what I mean
 You know what I mean mean
 Richards!
 
 She doesn't ride a motorbike
 She says it doesn't fit her
 But she always wears a monacle
 Richards on Richards
 
 You know what I mean
 You know what I mean
 You know what I mean mean
 Richards!
 
 Look over there, check out her hair
 She's really on an ego trip...
 Oh, look at her!
 
 You know what I mean
 You know what I mean
 You know what I mean mean
 Richards!

 Vote and don't
 Do what strangers tell you
 Vote although
 There's something I could tell you
 You might vote for someone else
 And I might want to change your mind
 So vote and don't today
 
 Vote and know
 It might make a difference
 Vote and know
 It might not make a difference
 You might see the contradiction
 But they're not talking to you
 Vote and don't today
 Vote and don't
 Vote and don't today

 Hangin' out 
 While the monkeys type away 
 Waiting in my room all day 
 
 Why be realistic? 
 Don't wake me from my dream 
 I was individualistic 
 They kicked me off the team 
 
 We live in a dump 
 Admit it's a dump 
 Our friends are all nuts 
 And half of 'em drunks 
 And if they're not nuts 
 Then they're retired nuts 
 And that might be the hardest nut 
 
 Makin' plans 
 The kind that go awry 
 Got a full life-time supply 
 
 Why be realistic? 
 Don't wake me from my dream 
 I was individualistic 
 They kicked me off the team 
 
 We're living with bats 
 What's good about that? 
 I hear they lay eggs 
 And when the eggs hatch 
 You gotta believe then 
 There's related madness 
 From the lead that's in the sealing wax 
 
 We live in a dump 
 Admit, it's a dump 
 Our friends are all nuts 
 And half of 'em drunks 
 And if they're not nuts 
 Then they're retired nuts 
 And that might be the hardest nut 
 
 We live in a dump
 
 Where was I? I forgot
 The point that I was making
 I said if I was smart that I would
 Save up for a piece of string
 And a rock to wind the string around
 
 Everybody wants a rock
 To wind a piece of string around
 Everybody wants a rock
 To wind a piece of string around
 
 Throw the crib door wide
 Let the people crawl inside
 Someone in this town
 Is trying to burn the playhouse down
 They want to stop the ones who want
 A rock to wind a string around
 But everybody wants a rock
 To wind a piece of string around
 
 Throw the crib door wide
 Let the people crawl inside
 Someone in this town
 Is trying to burn the playhouse down
 They want to stop the ones who want
 A rock to wind a string around
 But everybody wants a rock
 To wind a piece of string around
 
 If I were a carpenter I'd
 Hammer on my piglet, I'd
 Collect the seven dollars and I'd
 Buy a big prosthetic forehead
 And wear it on my real head
 
 Everybody wants prosthetic
 Foreheads on their real heads
 Everybody wants prosthetic
 Foreheads on their real heads
 
 Throw the crib door wide
 Let the people crawl inside
 Someone in this town
 Is trying to burn the playhouse down
 They want to stop the ones who want
 Prosthetic foreheads on their heads
 But everybody wants prosthetic
 Foreheads on their real heads
 
 Throw the crib door wide
 Let the people crawl inside
 Someone in this town
 Is trying to burn the foreheads down
 They want to stop the ones who want
 A rock to wind a string around
 But everybody wants a rock
 To wind a piece of string around
 
 Hi, we're the Replacements 
 Hi, we're the Replacements 
 Hi, we're the Replacements 
 And we're playing in a rock 'n' roll band 
 
 We're having a good time 
 We're having a good time 
 We're having a good time 
 Rock 'n' rollin' 'til the break of dawn 
 
 Hey, where's Tommy? Someone find Tommy
 We're out on the road
 Moving equipment, where's the equipment
 Soon we're going home
 
 Then we'll have a party 
 Then we'll have a party 
 Then we'll have a party 
 Rock 'n' rollin' 'til the break of dawn 
 
 Hi, we're the Replacements

 Wearing a raincoat is flying around in a plane
 Made of a raincoat
 But when you think of that
 You hurt your mind
 And you'll need a friend
 To talk you down
 
 Needing a friend to talk you down
 Is food that comes from a pipe
 But when you hate the food
 That comes from a pipe
 You will turn to drugs
 To help you sleep
 
 Turning to drugs to help you sleep
 Will only lead to sleep
 And sleeping is a gateway drug
 To being awake, being awake, being awake again
 
 Being awake is swimming around in a lake
 Of the undead
 And the undead are like
 A bunch of friends
 That demand constant attention
 
 Demanding constant attention
 Will only lead to attention
 And once they have your attention
 They use it to ask for attention
 And once they have that attention
 They use it to ask for attention
 
 Wearing a raincoat is flying around in a yellow rubber airplane
 Made out of a raincoat, yes but when you think of that
 You hurt your mind
 And you'll need your mind
 For later on
 
 Needing a mind for later on
 Is a friend that comes at a price
 But when you hate the friend
 That comes at a price
 You will play the drums
 To help you sleep
 
 I never went to the tropical island
 Though everybody said they saw me there
 And it wasn't me you punched a hole in
 At the west German protest march
 
 Simultaneous events don't happen
 We are isolated temporally
 And a part is never called the whole thing
 Though it bothers us to know it's so
 
 Every man is made of two opinions
 Every woman has a second half
 And it's samba time for Tambo and weep day for urine man 
 
 Yes, it's samba time for Tambo and weep day for urine man 
 
 I didn't write the words you hear me singing 
 
 I didn't sing the line before this one 
 
 You are not the one I was addressing 
 
 That person took a train to Africa 
 
 Where he met the consulate from Belgium
 Who is now a Buddhist in a cave
 Who is pitching for the Oakland raiders
 Striking out the batter she became
 
 Every man is made of two opinions
 Every woman has a second half
 And it's samba time for Tambo and weep day for urine man 
 
 Yes, it's samba time for Tambo and weep day for urine man 
 
 Yes, it's samba time for Tambo and weep day for urine man 
 
 Weep day for urine man 
 Weep day for urine man 
 Weep day for urine man 
 
 Weep day weep day
 Weep day weep day
 Weep day weep day
 
 Weep  weep  weep  weep 
 Weep  weep  weep  weep 
 Weep  weep  weep  weep 
 Weep  weep  weep  weep 
 Weep  weep  weep  weep 
 Weep  weep  weep 
 
 Welcome to the jungle, Jim
 Welcome to the jungle, Jim
 Welcome to it, Jim
 Welcome to the jungle, Anne
 Welcome to the jungle, Dan
 Welcome to it, John
 Think you're gonna like
 I think you're gonna like it
 Once you've given the jungle a chance
 Think you're gonna like it
 Once you've given it a chance
 In the Jungle
 In the Jungle
 In the Jungle
 Now you will be with me
 Put your hand in my hand
 Lift up the rock and see all the things
 That share the jungle with us
 Welcome to the
 Welcome to the
 Trees
 Trees
 Push me in the face again
 Push me in the face again
 Push me in the face
 Push me in the face again
 Push me in the face again
 Push me in the face
 Didn't really like
 I didn't really like
 The last time when you pushed me in the face
 Didn't really like
 The last time when you pushed my face
 In the Jungle
 In the Jungle
 In the Jungle
 Now you will be with me
 Put your hand in my hand
 Lift up the rock and see all the things
 That live in the jungle with us
 Put your hand near the bug
 We are so much like them
 See how the bug reacts to your hand
 In the same way as I do
 
 There's a band
 That's living in L.A.
 But they never get to play
 They're just working jobs all day
 
 But their plan
 Is to follow us around
 As we go from town to town
 They're copying our sound
 
 And at the House of Blues in
 West Hollywood
 They're taking notes from the back row
 And they're listening good
 
 All you bands
 Who are studying our grooves
 And stealing all our truths
 And copying all our moves
 
 I know your plan
 Is to follow us around
 As we go from town to town
 You're copying our sound
 
 And at the House of Blues in
 West Hollywood
 You're taking notes from the back row
 Now listen good
 
 All you bands
 Who are studying our grooves
 And stealing all our truths
 And copying all our moves
 
 I know your plan
 Is to follow us around
 As we go from town to town
 You're copying our sound
 
 You're copying our sound
 You're copying our sound!
 
 There's a knock at the door that I adore
 There's a face at the window, a smiling yellow face
 There's a knock at the door
 And if I were at home they'd find me there
 
 There's a note on the door that I would see
 And the furniture's barely been moved from where it was
 There's a note on the door
 And the note would say when it rains it snows
 
 When it rains it snows, I wonder why
 And now I know that when it rains it snows
 
 There's a nut with a shotgun bang bang bang
 There's a doctor, a waitress, a fireman with a hat
 There's a nut with a gun
 There's enough so they'll never know which one
 
 When it rains it snows, I wonder why
 And now I know that when it rains it snows
 
 I'll make a reckless prediction
 I'll still be in the kitchen
 When the lights come on
 I think we'll probably be good
 If stuff is still where it stood
 When the lights come on
 
 We won't remember each other
 But we'll probably recover
 Unless everyone's gone
 It might be too soon to say this
 But I think that we may just
 See the lights come on
 
 See I've been picturing
 Diagrams of master plans
 I taught myself to draw in the dust
 With what remains of my left hand
 
 And from what I can tell
 I'll be no more than a shell
 Or an automaton
 But we'll be laughing and shit
 It will have been worth it
 When the lights come on
 
 Unless we chicken out again
 Which is exactly how we ended up in here
 Our guard was down, we were disarmed
 They tampered with the smoke alarm
 
 There won't be any more trouble
 You'll be dragged from the rubble
 When the lights come on
 And I'll be looking so great
 I will have lost some weight
 When the lights come on
 
 We will be growing mustaches
 Once we're raised from the ashes
 When the lights come on
 We'll be encased in gold
 Desiccated and old
 When the lights come on
 
 See I've been picturing
 Diagrams of master plans
 I taught myself to draw in the dust
 With what remains of my left hand
 
 And from what I can tell
 Groping around, there's something else
 I feel a face, I feel a pulse
 
 I think I'm
 Tripping
 Something's got me by the hair
 Let's table this discussion
 Until my concussion
 On the bottom stair
 
 Unless I pass out once again
 And find the bandage where my kidney used to be
 Knocked over lamp, some broken plates
 Prescription pads for opiates
 
 I'm so tired of your lies
 And the evil things you're doing behind my back
 Are there crimes that you have never committed
 I doubt it sometimes I wonder when will you die
 
 You're insane
 You are bad
 You wreck everything you touch and you're a sociopath
 There's just one thing that everyone's wondering
 When will you die
 
 Schoolchildren stay at home and all the banks will close
 Each year we'll mark the date on which we celebrate
 
 I know how
 I know why
 I can picture every part of your comeuppance except
 For the one remaining piece of the puzzle
 Which is when you'll die
 
 This is Dan and that's Dan
 And there's Marty on the drums to complete the band
 And I'm John and he is also John and all of us are wondering
 When you're going to die
 
 Still you live
 You go on
 But you're running out the clock and if we knew how long
 I'd be counting down the days until the lovely one
 On which you're gone
 
 On that promised morning we will wake and greet the dawn
 Knowing that your wicked life is over and that we will carry on
 
 We'll exhale
 We'll high-five
 We will know at last how great it is to be alive
 We'll be lining up and buying tickets and then we'll be
 Jumping up and down on your grave
 
 You're insane
 You are bad
 You wreck everything you touch and you're a sociopath
 And the only way to mitigate would be to know the date
 You're scheduled to vacate
 When are you going to die
 Look me in the eye
 Tell me when you'll die
 
 Marmalade's from Scotland
 Rugs from Pakistan
 Mexico has jumping beans
 And cars are from Japan
 
 Clowns are from the circus
 Barking comes from dogs
 Eggs come from a chicken
 And log cabins come from logs
 
 But where, where do they make balloons? 
 But where, where do they make balloons? 
 
 New York has tall buildings
 New Jersey has its malls
 Pisa has a leaning tower
 Will it ever fall?
 
 The ocean has the fishes
 London has a tower
 In Holland they have windmills,
 Lots of bikes, and pretty flowers
 
 But where, where do they make balloons? 
 But where, where do they make balloons? 
 
 Balloons 
 Balloons 
 Balloons 
 Balloons 
 
 Spaghetti is from China 
 But Italians make it best 
 Ants can make an anthill 
 And monkeys make a mess 
 
 Hungary isn't hungry 
 And french fries aren't from France 
 Turkeys aren't from Turkey 
 They can't fly but they can dance 
 
 But where, where do they make balloons? 
 But where, where do they make balloons? 
 But where, where do they make balloons? 
 But where, where do they make balloons? 
 
 Where your eyes don't go a filthy scarecrow waves its broomstick arms
 And does a parody of each unconscious thing you do
 When you turn around to look it's gone behind you
 On its face it's wearing your confused expression
 Where your eyes don't go
 
 Where your eyes don't go a part of you is hovering
 It's a nightmare that you'll never be discovering
 You're free to come and go or talk like Kurtis Blow
 But there's a pair of eyes in back of your head
 
 Every jumbled pile of person has a thinking part that wonders
 What the part that isn't thinking isn't thinking of
 Should you worry when the skull head is in front of you
 Or is it worse because it's always waiting where your eyes don't go?
 
 Where your eyes don't go a part of you is hovering
 It's a nightmare that you'll never be discovering
 You're free to come and go or talk like Kurtis Blow
 But there's a pair of eyes in back of your head
 
 Where your eyes don't go a filthy scarecrow waves its broomstick arms
 And does a parody of each unconscious thing you do
 When you turn around to look it's gone behind you
 On its face it's wearing your confused expression
 Where your eyes don't go
 
 Which describes how you're feeling all the time
 Which describes how you're feeling all the
 Feeling all the time
 There's this guy in the sky and he makes you want to
 Want to make you sigh, like the time
 When you felt like you're feeling all the time
 And you sighed at the cracks in the ceiling all the time
 You said "I'm feeling fine" but it didn't really rhyme
 It didn't rhyme, overseas
 
 Which describes how you're feeling all the time
 
 It describes how you're feeling
 
 Which describes how you're feeling all the time
 When you lie that your life's unappealing all the time
 But your lie doesn't rhyme with the word overseas
 Overseas there's this guy
 Who describes how you're feeling all the time
 In his mind he can find how you're feeling all the time
 From behind distant lines
 Even straighter than his spine
 Which is fine
 Which is fine
 And describes how you're feeling all the time
 
 There was a swirling mass of water that lived in a quiet pond
 It asked permission from its master to visit the lands beyond
 And its master allowed it to fly
 So the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky
 The whirlpool's mother wore a jacket she'd sewn out of dental floss
 It was stolen by a monkey that sold it to an albatross
 And it had the idea to fly
 so the wind swept the whirlpool across the sky

 A woman came up to me and said
 "I'd like to poison your mind
 With wrong ideas that appeal to you
 Though I am not unkind"
 She looked at me, I looked at something
 Written across her scalp
 And these are the words that it faintly said
 As I tried to call for help
 
 There's only one thing that I know how to do well
 And I've often been told that you only can do
 What you know how to do well
 And that's be you,
 Be what you're like,
 Be like yourself,
 And so I'm having a wonderful time
 But I'd rather be whistling in the dark
 Whistling in the dark
 Whistling in the dark
 Whistling in the dark
 Whistling in the dark
 Whistling in the dark
 There's only one thing that I like
 And that is whistling in the dark
 
 A man came up to me and said
 "I'd like to change your mind
 By hitting it with a rock," he said,
 "Though I am not unkind."
 We laughed at his little joke
 And then I happily walked away
 And hit my head on the wall of the jail
 Where the two of us live today.
 
 There's only one thing that I know how to do well

 All right!
 Back in ancient times
 You know that things then weren't that easy
 So many different tribes
 So many different ways of writing
 So, who put the alphabet in alphabetical order?
 
 I wonder
 Who put the alphabet in alphabetical order?
 
 Oh
 Now I've got a question
 With an answer that you might find easier
 You've got to use your mind
 To remember all the letters in order
 Now, you put the alphabet in alphabetical order
 
 Come on!
 You put the alphabet in alphabetical order
 We're going to put the alphabet in alphabetical order now
 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T UV W X Y and Z
 Now I know my A-B-C's
 Next time won't you play with me?
 
 Oh, I put the alphabet in alphabetical order
 Yes, I put the alphabet in alphabetical order
 I did it!
 
 The sun is a miasma
 Of incandescent plasma
 The sun's not simply made out of gas
 No, no, no
 
 The sun is a quagmire
 It's not made of fire
 Forget what you've been told in the past
 
  Electrons are free
  Fourth state of matter
 Not gas, not liquid, not solid
 
 The sun isn't a red dwarf
 I hope it never morphs
 Into a supernova'd collapsed orb
 Orb, orb, orb
 
 The sun is a miasma
 Of incandescent plasma
 I forget what I was told by myself
 Elf, elf, elf
 
  Electrons are free
  Fourth state of matter
 Not gas, not liquid, not solid
 
  Forget that song
  They got it wrong
 That thesis has been rendered invalid
 
 No more mister nice guy
 I love the dead
 I've been thinking about it
 Now I understand what he said
 
 Ask me now
 I understand the words that Alice said
 I kick the rocks beneath me
 I squint at the sun
 Sad, sad, sad, sad
 Why must I be sad?
 The rows of dandelions growing all around me
 Why must I be sad? 
 
 No one knows these things but me and him
 So I'm writing everything down in a spiral notebook
 In the hopes that one day
 Other people will feel as low as this
 
 Ask me now
 I understand the words that Alice said
 I kick the rocks beneath me
 I squint at the sun
 Sad, sad, sad, sad
 Why must I be sad?
 The rows of dandelions growing all around me
 Why must I be sad?

 The pro is here to lead the way,
 To save the day,
 Wicked little critta.
 He clips the puck from Bobby Orr,
 He shoots, he scores
 Wicked little critta.
 
 As he proceeds to torch the place,
 As he proceeds to scorch the place,
 As he proceeds to torch the place,
 Scorcher, torture, scorcher
 Wicked little critta.
 
 He's a wicked little critta with a sissy bar,
 And he lays a patch on the tar,
 He's a wicked little critta with a sissy bar,
 And he lays a patch on the tar,
 And he pops a wheelie on his minibike,
 And he burns rubber and he peels out.
 He's a wicked little critta with a sissy bar,
 And he lays a patch on the tar,
 
 And he clip the puck from Havlicek,
 And Havlivcek is used and abused,
 He's a wicked little critta with a sissy bar,
 And he lays a patch on the tar,
 He decided to ditch and he ditches,
 And nobody knows where he ditched.
 He's a wicked little critta with a sissy bar,
 And he lays a patch on the tar.
 
 It's a wicked little guy
 Wicked pissa little guy
 Wicked scorcher little critta
 He's a wicked little guy.
 
 He's a dink.
 Way to go.
 I like him.
 I got problems.
 
 Look at all the people in the window
 I'm checking out the people in the window
 I was uncomfortable
 Now I'm uncomfortable
 The trouble I encountered when I thought it was, it was a window
 
 It was a catalog
 Of many women, men
 The window
 Window
 Window
 
 Look at all the people in the window

 Now I'm uncomfortable
 The trouble I encountered when I thought it was, it was a window

 She will send you down
 
 She's in love

 She's in love

 She's in love with the dark
 
 I'm getting tired of all my nautical dreams
 I'm getting tired of all my nautical themes
 Busting my pirate hump
 Rocking my peg leg stump
 My mind naturally turns to taxidermy
 To taxidermy, yeah
 
 Crushes, crashes, smashes to pieces
 Crushes, crashes, smashes to pieces
 Crushes, crashes, smashes to pieces
 We're taking over
 We're taking over
 
 I looked around
 And you looked around
 And soon we were there
 Leading the charge of the wrong
 Of the wrong
 Of the wrong
 Of the wrong
 
 Rusted, crusted, combusted, and dusted
 Rusted, crusted, combusted, and dusted
 Rusted, crusted, combusted, and dusted
 We're taking over
 We're taking over
 
 Back in command of the out of control
 All over town
 Putting them all in the ground
 In the ground
 In the ground
 In the ground
 
 No more sunlight, please
 
 Very Sad Sack is a sad bag
 Very, very sad
 Very Sad Sack
 
 Withered Hope says she is his friend, to the end
 But she doesn't like Very Sad Sack
 
 Today Withered Hope saw the Very Sad Sack
 And she tried not to meet his eyes
 As he cut out a paper heart,
 Pinned it to his arm,
 Told her everything he was holding in his head,
 This is what he said:
 
 Withered Hope, I'm in love with you,
 Wanna live with you, Withered Hope!
 Are you gonna say to me, this can never be,
 Are you gonna say to me, Withered Hope?
 
 Saaad Saaaaaaaaaack!
 Saaad Saaaaaaaaaack!
 
 Withered Hope says she has a soul mate
 Living in a city in another state
 But the soul mate thinks about a picture in a book
 Of a beautiful crook
 But the picture in the book, of the crook, is in love
 With a brand new motorbike
 But the motorbike doesn't like crooks
 ...it's in love with the Very Sad Sack!
 
 Sad Sack, I'm in love with you,
 Wanna live with you, Sad Sack!
 Are you gonna say to me, this can never be,
 Are you gonna say to me, Sad Sack?
 
 Saaad Saaaaaaaaaack!
 Saaad Saaaaaaaaaack!
 
 When the ship runs out of ocean
 and the vessel runs aground
 Land's where we know the boat is found
 Now there's nothing unexpected
 about the water running out
 "Land's" not a word we have to shout
 
 But there's something beside the shoreline
 coming up from the shipwreck
 moving across the beachhead
 Making as if to say:
 Women & Men
 Bringing with them messages of love
 and everywhere they go love will grow
 
 When you see the faces of the women
 and the men, you too will know
 Women & Men have crossed the ocean
 They now begin to pour
 out from the boat and up the shore
 Two by two they enter the jungle
 and soon they number more
 Three by three as well as four by four
 soon the stream of people gets wider
 then it becomes a river
 river becomes an ocean
 carrying ships that bear
 Women & Men

 I've been working hard, trying to sing and play guitar.
 Growing out my hair, and practicing my stare.
 
 Paid to fake it in a traveling band,
 And I'm working undercover for the man.
 Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la
 
 Planing midnight raids on our unsuspecting fans,
 While roadies rig the video surveillance van.
 
 Paid to fake it in a traveling band,
 And I'm working undercover for the man.
 Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la
 Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la

 I know you deceived me, couldn't sleep last night
 Now my tear stains on the wall reflect an ugly sight
 I can see your secrets
 No need to confess
 Everyone looks naked when you know the world's address
 
 The world's address
 A place that's worn
 A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
 I'll repeat it for those who may not have already guessed
 The world's address
 
 Life's parade of fashion just leaves me depressed
 Under every garment I can see the world's address
 Call the men of science and let them hear this song
 Tell them Albert Einstein and Copernicus were wrong
 
 The world's address

 X-T-C versus Adam Ant
 Content versus form
 Fighting for their place in rock and roll
 There is no right or wrong
 
 Just when you think it's finished
 With X-T-C on top
 Ant music, like a phoenix
 Flies back up the charts
 
 X-T-C versus Adam Ant
 Only one will survive
 Beatle-based pop versus new romantic
 History will decide
 
 X-T-C versus Adam Ant
 I can't tell you why
 Even the singer from Bow Wow Wow
 Can't make up her mind
 
 X-T-C versus Adam Ant
 Time is marching on
 X-T-C versus Adam Ant
 There is no right or wrong
 
 There is no right or wrong
 
 There is
 No right
 Or wrong
 
 Yo yo yo! Come on come on!
 
 Now every evening, when all my day's work is through 
 I call my baby and ask her what we could do
 I mention movies, she doesn't seem to dig that
 And then she asks me, why don't I come to her flat
 And have some supper and let the evening pass by
 By playing records, the sounds of groovy hi-fi?
 
 I say "yeh yeh"
 That's what I say
 I say "yeh yeh"
 
 My baby loves me, she gets me feelin' so fine
 And when she loves me, she makes me know that she's mine 
 And when she kisses, I feel the fire get hot
 She never misses, she gives it all that she's got
 And when she asks me if everything is okay
 I give the answer, the only thing I can say
 
 I say "yeh yeh"
 That's what I say
 I say "yeh yeh"
 
 We'll play a melody and turn the lights down low
 So that none can see
 We gotta do that, we gotta do that
 We gotta do that, we gotta do that
 And there'll be no one else alive in all the world 'cept you and me
 
 Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
 Yeh yeh yeh yeh
 
 And pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill 
 It's hard to tell you, because I'm tremblin' still 
 No need to ask me if everything is okay 
 I got my answer, the only thing I can say 
 
 I say "yeh yeh"
 That's what I say
 I say "yeh yeh"
 
 Ahh! Open your mind 
 To electric guitars 
 Open your mind 
 
 We'll play a melody and turn the lights down low so that none can see
 We gotta do that, we gotta do that
 We gotta do that, we gotta do that
 And there'll be no one else alive in all the world 'cept you and me
 
 Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
 Yeh yeh yeh yeh
 
 And pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill 
 It's hard to tell you, because I'm tremblin' still
 But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
 I think I'm ready to leave those others alone
 No need to ask me if everything is okay
 I got my answer, the only thing I can say
 
 I say "yeh yeh"
 That's what I say
 I say "yeh yeh"
 That's what I say
 I say "yeh yeh"
 That's what I say
 I say "yeh yeh"
 
 "You are old, Father William," the young man said
 "And your hair has become very white
 And yet you incessantly stand on your head
 Do you think, at your age, it is right?"
 
 "In my youth," Father William replied to his son
 "I feared it might injure the brain
 But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none
 Why, I do it again and again
 
 "I am old
 I am old
 I will tell you again
 I am old"
 
 "You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before
 And have grown most uncommonly fat
 Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door
 Pray, what is the reason of that?"
 
 "In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his gray locks
 "I kept all my limbs very supple
 By the use of this ointment, one shilling a box
 Allow me to sell you a couple?
 
 "I am old
 I am old
 It's a statement, in fact
 I am old"
 
 "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak
 For anything tougher than suet
 Yet you finish the goose, with the bones and the beak
 Pray, how did you manage to do it?"
 
 "In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law
 And argued each case with my wife
 And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw
 Has lasted the rest of my life
 
 "I am old
 I am old
 There's not much more to say
 I am old"
 
 "You are old," said the youth, "one would hardly suppose
 That your eye was as steady as ever
 Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
 What made you so awfully clever?"
 
 "I have answered three questions, and that is enough"
 Said his father, "don't give yourself airs!
 Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
 Be off or I'll kick you downstairs
 
 "Downstairs
 Downstairs
 Be off or I'll kick you downstairs!"
 
 
 Do you mind
 Excuse me
 I saw you over there
 Can I just tell you
 Although there are millions of cephalophores
 That wander through this world
 You've got something extra going on
 I think you probably know
 You probably get that a lot
 I'll bet that people say that a lot to you girl
 
 The way you swing your head while strolling fancy free
 Or melting down some army guys to make green tea
 Though there are millions of cephalophores
 That wander through this world
 You've got something extra going on
 I think you probably know
 You probably already know
 You act like I am stating the obvious
 
 It's the way you swing your head while strolling fancy free
 Or melting down some army guys to make green tea
 
 As the headless horseman said to his associate
 The bodiless baboonsman cradled in his arms
 Although millions of cephalophores
 Are walking past my door
 They're invisible to me except for one cephalophore
 You probably get that a lot
 I'll bet that people say that a lot
 While you are sarcastically lip-syncing along
 To words they felt were spoken spontaneously
 
 You'll always miss my big old body
 In its prime and never shoddy,
 While bloodhounds wait down in the lobby you'll eulogize my big old body
 
 You'll miss me with effigies
 Lighting up your house like Xmas trees
 As tears roll down below your knees
 You'll miss me with effigies
 
 Go find a man to fit my shoes
 Left one's old and the right one's new
 And I bought the right one just for you
 Go find a man to fit my shoes
 
 You'll see my teeth in the stars above
 Every tree a finger of my glove
 And every time push comes to shove
 You'll see my teeth in the stars above
 
 Your money talks but my genius walks
 Morticians wait with a shovel and a fork
 As detectives trace my hands with chalk
 Your money talks but my genius walks
 
 You'll miss me so
 You will miss me
 It must be raining because a man ain't supposed to cry
 But I look up and I don't see a cloud
 
 Hi, I forgot your name
 Whatever
 My point is
 Hi, your head's on fire
 
 Oh damn, you must've got one of them
 Combustible heads
 I read an article all about them
 
 You're on fire
 You're on fire
 I won't lie
 You're on fire
 
 Combustible head 
 Combustible head 
 Combustible head 
 Combustible head 
 
 Hey, how's it going
 Is that your car they're towing?
 I'm pretty sure that's your car
 No, you can't park there
 Whoa, your head's on fire
 
 Oh damn, you must've got one of them
 Combustible heads
 I read an article all about them
 
 You're on fire
 You're on fire
 I won't lie
 You're on fire
 
 Combustible head 
 Combustible head 
 Combustible head 
 Combustible head
 
 The lights are low
 The music is extremely loud 
 You're hard to get to know
 But you're easy to spot in a crowd
 
 As I'm sure you're aware
 You've got one of those rare
 Combustible heads
 I read an article all about them
 
 You're on fire
 You're on fire 
 I won't lie 
 You're on fire 
 
 Oh damn, you must've got one of them 
 Combustible heads 
 I read an article all about them 
 
 You're on fire 
 You're on fire 
 I won't lie 
 You're on fire 
 
 I won't lie
 I won't lie
 I won't lie
 I won't lie
 
 Your ass or a hole in the ground
 You choose baby
 Your ass or a hole in the ground
 It's your choice baby
 
 Make up your mind
 Make up your mind
 Make up your mind
 Make up your mind
 
 Because it's your ass or a hole in the ground
 Your ass or a hole in the ground
 
 Just make up your mind
 Make up your mind
 Make up your mind
 Make up your tiny mind
 
 It's your own worst enemy
 Ringing the bell on the door
 And the person inside says nobody's home
 So your own worst enemy peeks inside
 And sees you softly weeping as some music fills the room
 
 And the song they play
 Is that guy with the messed up face
 Going, precious and few are the moments that you
 And your own worst enemy share
 
 Full bottle in front of me
 Time to roll up my sleeves
 And get to work
 And after many glasses of work
 I get paid in the brain
 
 And the song they play
 Is that guy with the messed up face
 Going, precious and few are the moments that you
 And your own worst enemy share
 
 And the song they play
 Is that guy with the messed up face
 Going, precious and few are the moments that you
 And your own worst enemy share
 
 It's your own worst enemy
 
 This is where the party ends
 I can't stand here listening to you
 And your racist friend
 I know politics bore you
 But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
 And your racist friend
 
 It was the loveliest party that I've ever attended
 If anything was broken I'm sure it could be mended
 My head can't tolerate this bobbing and pretending
 Listen to some bullet-head and the madness that he's saying
 
 This is where the party ends
 I'll just sit here wondering how you
 Can stand by your racist friend
 I know politics bore you
 But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
 You and your racist friend
 
 This is where the party ends
 I can't stand here listening to you
 And your racist friend
 I know politics bore you
 But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
 And your racist friend
 
 Out from the kitchen to the bedroom to the hallway
 Your friend apologizes, he could see it my way
 He let the contents of the bottle do the thinking
 Can't shake the devil's hand and say you're only kidding
 
 This is where the party ends
 I can't stand here listening to you
 And your racist friend
 I know politics bore you
 But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
 And your racist friend
 
 Youth culture 
 Youth culture 
 Youth culture 
 Youth culture 
 
 Youth culture killed my dog
 And I don't think it's fair 
 And his suicide can be justified
 By the taste makers, how they cried and cried and so
 
 Bacharach and David used to write his favorite songs
 Never, never, never would he worry, he'd just run and fetch the ball
 But the night lights and my dog's life aren't exactly one and the same
 
 Youth culture killed my dog
 And I don't think it's fair 
 And the judgment made in the city of hate
 Just broke his spirit so
 
 Bacharach and David used to write his favorite songs
 Never, never, never would he worry, he'd just run and fetch the ball
 But the hip hop and the white funk just blew away my puppy's mind
 
 I don't understand what you did to my dog
 And I don't understand what you did to my dog
 I don't understand what you did to my dog
 I don't understand what you did to my dog
 
 Youth culture killed my dog 
 And I don't think it's fair 
 And his suicide can be justified
 By the taste makers, how they cried and cried and so
 
 Youth culture 
 Youth culture 
 Broke his spirit so 
 Broke his spirit so
 Youth culture 
 
 Youth culture 
 
 Broke his spirit so 
 Broke his spirit so

 By yon bonnie banks, by yon bonnie braes
 Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond
 Me and my true love were ever want to be
 On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond
 
 You take the high road and I'll take the low road
 I'll be in Scotland before you
 But me and my true love will never meet again
 On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond
 
 Mind where we parted in yon shady glen
 On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomond
 Where in deep purple hues
 The Highland hills we viewed
 And the moon coming out in the gloaming
 
 You take the high road and I'll take the low road'
 The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring
 And the sunshine and the waters are sleeping
 The broken heart it kens, no second Spring again
 And the world does not know how we're greeting
 
 You take the high road
 And I'll take the low road'
 
 
 old joe clark
 old joe clark, he had a house
 eighteen stories high
 every story in that house
 was filled with chicken pie
 
 round and round, old joe clark
 round and round i say
 round and round, old joe clark
 ain't got long to stay
 
 i went down to old joe's house
 he invited me for supper
 stubbed my toe on the table leg
 and stuck my nose in butter
 
 roll around, old joe clark
 sail away and gone
 roll around, old joe clark
 with your golden slippers on 
 
 i went down to old joe's house
 never been there before
 he slept on a feather bed
 i slept on the floor
 
 round and round, old joe clark
 round and round i say
 round and round, old joe clark
 ain't got long to stay
 
 old joe clark he had a cow
 she was muley born
 it take a jaybird a week and a half
 to fly from horn to horn
 
 round and round, old joe clark
 round and round i say
 round and round, old joe clark
 ain't got long to stay
 
 fly around, old joe clark
 fly around and gone
 fly around, old joe clark
 with your golden slippers on 
 
 when i was a little boy 
 i used to play with matches
 now i am a great big boy
 wearing dad's moustaches
 
 round and round, old joe clark
 round and round and gone
 round and round, old joe clark
 with your golden slippers on 
 
 round and round, old joe clark
 round and round i say
 round and round, old joe clark
 ain't got long to stay 
 
 Walked with no one and talked with no one
 And I had nothing but shadows
 Then one morning you passed
 And I brightened at last
 Now I greet the day and complete the day
 With the sun in my heart
 All my worry blew away
 When you taught me how to say
 
 Grab your coat and get your hat
 Leave your worry on the doorstep
 Just direct your feet
 To the sunny side of the street
 Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
 And that happy tune is your step
 Life can be so sweet
 On the sunny side of the street
 
 I used to walk in the shade
 With those blues on parade
 But I'm not afraid
 This Rover crossed over
 
 If I never have a cent
 I'd be rich as Rockefeller
 Gold dust at my feet
 On the sunny side of the street
 Grab your street
 
 Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
 There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
 Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
 And the dreams that you dare to dream,
 Really do come true.
 
 Someday I'll wish upon a star
 And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
 Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
 High above the chimney tops,
 That's where you'll find me.
 
 Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
 Birds fly over the rainbow
 Why then, oh why can't I?
 If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
 Why, oh why can't I?
 
 Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
 There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
 Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
 And the dreams that you dare to dream,
 Really do come true.
 
 Someday I'll wish upon a star
 And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
 Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
 High above the chimney tops,
 That's where you'll find me.
 
 Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
 Birds fly over the rainbow
 Why then, oh why can't I?
 If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
 Why, oh why can't I?
 
 Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
 Look away, you rollin' river
 Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
 Look away. We're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri
 
 Now the Missouri is a mighty river
 Look away, you rollin' river.
 Indians camp along her border
 Look away. We're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri
 
 Well a white man loved an Indian maiden
 Look away, you rollin' river
 With notions his canoe was laden
 Look away, we're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri
 
 Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
 Look away, you rollin' river
 It was for her I'd cross the water.
 Look away, we're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri
 
 For seven long years I courted Sally
 Look away, you rollin' river
 Seven more years I longed to have her
 Look away, we're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri
 
 Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear,
 I'm bound to leave you
 Look away you rollin' river
 Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
 Look away, we're bound away
 Across the wide Missouri 
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Shenandoah, I long to hear you,
 Away, you rolling river,
 Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you,
 Away, I'm bound away,
 across the wide Missouri.
 
 Shenandoah, I love your daughter,
 Away, you rolling river,
 It's been seven long years since I saw her'
 
 Shenandoah, I took a notion
 Away, you rolling river,
 To sail across the stormy ocean'
 
 The missouri she's a mighty river
 Away, you rolling river,
 When she rolls down her topsails quiver'
 
 Shenandoah, I'm bound to leave you
 Away, you rolling river,
 Oh shenandoah, I'll not deceive you'
 
 Shenandoah, I long to hear you,
 Away, you rolling river,
 Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you'
 
 Well we ain't got a barrel of money
 We may look ragged and funny
 But we're travelin' on
 Singing our song
 Side by side
 
 Through all kinds of weather 
 What if the sky should fall? 
 As long as we're together 
 It doesn't matter at all 
 So we ain't got a barrel of money 
 We may look ragged and funny 
 But we're travelin' on 
 Singing our song 
 Side by side 
 
 Through all kinds of weather 
 Drought flood rain and snow 
 We will be together 
 So it just don't matter at all 
 
 Oh we ain't got a barrel of money 
 We may look ragged and funny 
 But we're travelin' on 
 Singing our song 
 Side by side 
 
 Don't know what's comin' tomorrow 
 Maybe it's trouble and sorrow 
 But we'll travel the road 
 Sharin' our load 
 Side by side 
 
 Oh we ain't got a barrel of money 
 We may look ragged and funny 
 But we're travelin' on 
 Singing our song 
 Side by side 
 
 When they've all had their quarrels and parted 
 We'll be the same as we started 
 Just travlin' along singin' a song 
 Side by side
 
 We sailed on the sloop John B
 My grandfather and me
 Around Nassau town we did roam
 Drinking all night
 Got into a fight
 Well I feel so broke up
 I want to go home
 
 So hoist up the John B's sail
 See how the mainsail sets
 Send for the Captain ashore
 I want to go home, O let me go home
 Please let me go home
 I feel so broke up - I want to go home
 
 Well the first mate he got drunk,
 Broke up the peoples trunk
 constable had to come and take him away
 Sheriff John Stone
 please leave me alone
 I feel so broke up I want to go home
 
 The cook he had a fit
 Ate up all my grits
 then he went and ate up all of my corn
 O let me go home, please let me go home
 This is the worst trip I've ever been on
