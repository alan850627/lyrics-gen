 I was a stranger in the city
 Out of town were the people I knew
 I had that feeling of self-pity
 What to do, what to do, what to do
 The outlook was decidedly blue
 
 But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
 It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known
 
 A foggy day, in London town
 Had me low, had me down
 I viewed the morning, with much alarm
 British Museum, had lost its charm
 
 How long I wondered,
 Could this thing last
 But the age of miracles, hadn't past
 For suddenly, I saw you there
 And through foggy London town,
 The sun was shining everywhere
 
 For suddenly, I saw you there
 And through foggy London town,
 The sun was shining everywhere
 
 Everywhere
 Everywhere
 Everywhere
 
 All or nothing at all
 Half a love, never appealed to me
 If your heart, never could yield to me
 Then I'd rather  have nothing at all
 
 All or nothing at all
 If it's love, there is no in between
 Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
 No I'd rather  have nothing at all
 
 But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
 Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
 The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
 And my heart may go dizzy and fall
 
 And if I fell  under the spell of your call
 I would be, caught in the undertow
 So you see, I've got to say no, no
 All or nothing at all
 
 
 
 Through the trees comes autumn with her serenade.
 Melodies the sweetest music ever played.
 Autumn kisses we knew are beautiful souvenirs.
 As I pause to recall the leaves seem to fall like tears.
 Silver stars were clinging to an autumn sky.
 Love was ours until October wandered by.
 Let the years come and go, 
 I'll still feel the glow that time can not fade
 When I hear that lovely autumn serenade.
 
 I'm giving up the ghost of love
 And a  shadow is cast on devotion.
 
 She's the one that I adore
 Qween of my silent suffocation.
 
 Break this bittersweet spell on me,
 Lost in the arms of destiny.
 
 Bittersweet.
 
 I won't give up; I'm possessed by her.
 
 I'm bearing a cross; she turned into my curse.
 
 Break this bittersweet spell on me,
 Lost in the arms of destiny,
 Bittersweet, I want you 
 And I need you 
 
 Break this bittersweet spell on me,
 Lost in the arms of destiny.
 Break this bittersweet spell on me,
 Lost in the arms of destiny.
 
 Bittersweet.
 
 My heart is sad and lonely
 For you I sigh, for you dear only
 Why haven't you seen it
 I'm all for you body and soul
 
 I spend my days in longing
 And wondering why it's me you're wronging
 I tell you I mean it
 I'm all for you body and soul
 
 I can't believe it
 It's hard to conceive it
 That you'd turn away romance
 Are you pretending
 It looks like the ending
 Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear
 
 My life a wreck you're making
 You know I'm yours for just the taking
 I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
 
 My life a wreck you're making
 You know I'm yours for the very taking
 I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
 
 Old man sunshine listen you
 Never tell me dreams come true
 Just try it and I'll start a riot
 Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
 Ever tell me he will care
 I'm certain it's the final curtain
 I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
 Who tell you fate supplies a mate
 It's all bananas
 
 They're writing songs of love but not for me
 A lucky star's above but not for me
 With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
 Than any Russian play could guarantee
 
 I was a fool to fall and get that way
 Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
 Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
 I guess he's not for me
 
 I was a fool to fall and get that way
 Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
 Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
 
 No one here can love or understand me
 Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
 Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 
 Where somebody waits for me
 Sugar's sweet, so is she
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 
 No one here can love or understand me
 Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
 Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
 Blackbird, bye, bye
 
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 Where somebody waits for me
 Sugar's sweet, so is she
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 
 No one here can love or understand me
 Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me
 Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
 Blackbird, bye, bye
 
 Dear old Southland I hear you calling me.
 And I long how I long to roam 
 back to my old Kentucky home.
 Dear old Southland for you my heart is yearning
 And I long just to see once more
 
 If I should write a book for you
 That brought me fame and fortune too,
 That book would be,
 Like my heart and me,
 Dedicated to you.
 
 And if I should paint a picture too
 That showed the loveliness of you,
 My art would be,
 Like my heart and me,
 Dedicated to you.
 
 To you,
 Because your love is the beacon that lights up my way.
 To you,
 Because with you I know a lifetime could be just one heavenly day.
 
 If I should find a twinkling star,
 One half as wondrous as you are,
 That star would be
 Like my heart and me,
 Dedicated to you.
 
 To you,
 Because your love is the beacon that lights up my way.
 To you,
 Because with you I know a lifetime could be just one heavenly day.
 
 If I should find a twinkling star,
 One half as wondrous as you are,
 That star would be
 Like my heart and me,
 Dedicated to you.
 
 Ever since the lucky night I found you
 I've hung around you just like a fool
 Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.
 
 My poor heart is in an awful state now
 But it's too late now to call a halt
 
 So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!
 
 Don't blame me for falling in love with you
 I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
 Don't' blame me!
 
 Can't you see when you do the things you do!
 If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
 Don't blame; me.
 
 Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
 Makes me need someone like you to love!
 
 Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
 And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
 But don't blame me.
 
 I like every single thing about you
 Without a doubt you are like a dream
 In my mind I find a picture of us as a team
 
 Ever since the hour of our meeting
 I've been repeating a silly phrase
 Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.
 
 Don't blame me for falling in love with you
 I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
 Don't' blame me!
 
 Can't you see when you do the things you do!
 If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
 Don't blame; me.
 
 Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
 Makes me need someone like you to love!
 
 Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
 And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
 But don't blame me.
 
 Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
 Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!
 
 Just one look at you
 My heart grew tipsy in me,
 You and you alone
 Bring out the gypsy in me! 
 
 I love all, the many charms about you!
 Above all, I want my arms about you! 
 
 Don't be a naughty baby,
 Come to papa, come to papa, do!
 My sweet embraceable you!
 
 I used to have a perfect sweetheart
 Not a real one, just a dream
 A wonderful vision of us as a team
 Can you imagine how I feel now
 Love is real now, it's ideal
 You're just what I wanted
 And now it's nice to live
 Paradise to live
 
 I know why I've waited
 Know why I've been blue
 Prayed each night for someone
 Exactly like you
 
 Why should we spend money
 On a show or two
 No one does those love scenes
 Exactly like you
 
 You make me feel so grand
 I want to hand the world to you
 I hope you'll understand
 Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
 And dream I'm dreamin'
 
 Now I know why mother
 Taught me to be true
 She meant me for someone
 Exactly like you
 
 How much do I love you?
 I'll tell you no lie
 How deep is the ocean?
 How high is the sky?
 
 How many times a day do I think of you?
 How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
 
 How far would I travel
 To be where you are?
 How far is the journey
 From here to a star?
 
 And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
 How deep is the ocean?
 How high is the sky?
 
 How far would I travel
 To be where you are?
 How far is the journey
 From here to a star?
 
 And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
 How deep is the ocean?
 How high is the sky?
 How high is the sky?
 
 If they ask me, I could write a book
 About the way you walk and whisper and look
 I could write a preface on how we met
 So the world would never forget
 
 And the simple secret of the plot
 Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
 Then the world discovers as my book ends
 How to make two lovers of friends
 
 If they ask me, I could write a book

 So the world would never forget, never, never forget
 
 And the simple secret of the plot
 Is just to tell them that I love you, allot
 Then the world discovers as my book ends
 How to make two lovers of friends
 
 Though folks with good intentions
 Tell me to save my tears
 Well I'm so mad about him
 I can't live without him
 
 Never treats me sweet and gentle
 The way he should
 I've got it bad
 And that ain't good
 
 My poor heart is so sentimental
 Not made of wood
 I've got it so bad
 And that ain't good
 
 But when the fish are jumpin'
 And Friday rolls around
 My man an' I, we gin some
 We pray some, and sin some
 
 He don't love me like I love him
 The way he should
 I've got it bad
 And that ain't good
 Yes I've got it bad
 And that ain't good
 
 I wish I knew someone like you could love me
 I wish I knew you place no one above me
 Did I mistake this for a real romance?
 I wish I knew, but only you can answer.
 
 If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
 Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
 Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
 What shall I do, I wish I knew
 
 I'll get by
 As long as I have you
 Though there be rain
 And darkness too
 I'll not complain
 I'll see it through
 
 Poverty
 May come to me, it's true
 But what care I
 Say, I'll get by
 As long as I have you.
 
 But what care I
 Say, I'll get by
 As long as I have you.
 
 Ask me how do I feel
 Ask me now that we're cosy and clingin'
 Well, sir, all I can say
 Is if I were a bell, I'd be ringin'
 From the moment we kissed tonight
 That's the way I've just gotta behave
 Boy, if I were a lamp, I'd light
 Or if I were a banner, I'd wave
 
 Ask me how do I feel
 Little me with my quiet upbringing
 Well, sir, all I can say
 Is if I were a gate, I'd be swinging
 And if I were a watch
 I'd start popping my springs
 Or if I were a bell
 I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding
 
 Yes, I knew my morale would crack
 From the wonderful way that you looked
 Boy, if I were a duck, I'd quack
 Or if I were a goose, I'd be cooked
 
 Ask me how do I feel
 Ask me now that we're fondly caressing
 Well, if I were a salad
 I know I'd be splashing my dressing
 Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
 Or if I were a gate, I would swing
 Have a fling almost any old thing
 Or if I were a bell
 I'd go ding dong, ding dong
 Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding, ding dong
 
 If there is someone lovelier than you
 Then I am blind, a man without a mind
 If there is someone lovelier than you
 
 But no, I'm not blind
 My eyes have traveled everywhere
 In hopes that I might find, a creature half so fair
 
 If there is someone lovelier than you
 By all that's beautiful
 Such beauty can't be true
 
 If there is someone lovelier than you
 By all that's beautiful
 Such beauty can't be true
 
 In a Sentimental Mood I can see
 The stars come through my room
 While your loving attitude is
 Like a flame that lights the gloom
 On the wings of ev'ry kiss
 Drift a melody so strange and sweet
 In this sentimental bliss you make
 My Paradise complete
 Rose pearls seem to fall
 It's all like a dream to call you mine
 My heart's lighter thing since you
 Made me this night a thing divine
 In A Sentimental Mood
 I'm within a world so heavenly
 For I never dreamt that you'd be
 Loving sentimental me
 In A Sentimental Mood I can see
 The stars come through my room
 While your loving attitude is
 Like a flame that lights the gloom
 On the wings of ev'ry kiss
 Drift a melody so strange and sweet
 In this sentimental bliss you make
 My Paradise complete
 Rose pearls seem to fall
 It's all like a dream to call you mine
 My heart's lighter thing since you
 Made me this night a thing divine
 In A Sentimental Mood
 I'm within a world so heavenly
 For I never dreamt that you'd be
 Loving sentimental me
 
 Say, it's only a paper moon
 Sailing over a cardboard sea
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me
 
 Yes, it's only a canvas sky
 Hanging over a muslin tree
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me
 
 Without your love
 It's a honky tonk parade
 Without your love
 It's a melody played in a penny arcade
 
 It's a Barnum and Bailey world
 Just as phony as it can be
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me

 How happy I would be
 If you believed in me
 
 Just friends, lovers no more
 Just friends, but not like before
 To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
 Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
 Two friends drifting apart
 Two friends, but one broken heart
 We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died
 
 Just you, just me
 Let's find a cozy spot
 To cuddle and coo
 
 Just us, just we
 I've missed an awful lot
 My trouble is you
 
 Oh, gee!
 What are your charms for?
 What are my arms for?
 Use your imagination!
 Just you, just me
 I'll tie a lover's knot
 'Round wonderful you!
 
 Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
 Hearing guitars like someone in love.
 Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
 Mostly whenever you're around me.
 Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
 Bump into things like someone in love.
 Each time I look at you, 
 I'm limp as a glove, 
 And feeling like someone in love.
 
 You went away
 I let you
 We broke the ties that bind
 I wanted to forget you
 And leave the past behind
 Still, the magic of the night I met you
 Seems to stay forever in my mind
 
 The sky was blue
 And high above
 The moon was new
 And so was love
 This eager heart of mine was singing
 Lover where can you be
 
 You came at last
 Love had its day
 That day is past
 You've gone away
 This aching heart of mine is singing
 Lover come back to me
 When I remember every little thing
 
 You used to do
 I'm so lonely
 Every road I walk along
 I walk along with you
 No wonder I am lonely
 
 The sky is blue
 The night is cold
 The moon is new
 But love is old
 And while I'm waiting here
 This heart of mine is singing
 Lover come back to me
 When I remember every little thing
 
 You used to do
 I grow lonely
 Every road I walk along
 I walk along with you
 No wonder I am lonely
 
 The sky is blue
 The  night is cold
 The moon is new
 But love is old
 And while I'm waiting here
 This heart of mine is singing
 Lover come back to me
 
 The very thought of you makes my heart sing
 Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
 And you appear in all your splendor
 My one and only love
 
 The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
 In the hush of night while you're in my arms
 I feel your lips, so warm and tender
 My one and only love
 
 The touch of your hand is like heaven
 A heaven that I've never known
 The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
 Tells me that you are my own
 
 You fill my eager heart with such desire
 Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
 I give myself in sweet surrender
 My one and only love
 My one and only love
 
 It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
 A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
 Romance was the theme
 And we were the players
 I never think of this without a sigh
 
 Lover, one lovely day
 Love came, planning to stay
 Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
 The setting for nights beyond forgetting
 And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
 When I recall the love I found on
 I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
 Lover, one lovely day
 Love came, planning to stay
 Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
 The setting for nights beyond forgetting
 And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
 When I recall the love I found on
 On Green Dolphin Street
 
 Once in a while will you try to give
 One little thought to me
 Though someone else may be
 Nearer your heart?
 
 Once in a while will you dream
 Of the moments I shared with you
 Moments before we two
 Drifted apart?
 
 In love's smoldering ember
 One spark may remain
 If love still can remember
 That spark may burn again
 
 I know that I'll be contented
 With yesterday's memory
 Knowing you think of me
 Once in a while
 
 In love's smoldering ember
 One spark may remain
 If love still can remember
 The spark may burn again
 
 I know that I'll be contented
 With yesterday's memory
 Knowing you think of me
 Once in a while
 
 A love supreme... 
 
 A country dance was being held in a garden
 I felt a bump and heard an "Oh, beg your pardon"
 Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
 All around a pug-nosed dream
 
 The music started and was I the perplexed one
 I held my breath and said "May I have the next one?"
 In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
 Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream
 
 There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
 As we floated over the floor
 There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
 And perhaps a few things more
 
 Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
 I know the meaning of the words "Ever after"
 And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
 When I kiss the pug-nosed dream
 
 Speak low when you speak, love,
 Our summer day withers away
 Too soon, too soon.
 
 Speak low when you speak, love,
 Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
 We're swept apart too soon.
 
 Speak low, darling speak low,
 Love is a spark lost in the dark,
 Too soon, too soon,
 I feel wherever I go
 That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
 And always too soon.
 
 Time is so old and love so brief,
 Love is pure gold and time a thief.
 We're late darling, we're late,
 The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
 Too soon, too soon,
 I wait darling, I wait
 Will you speak low to me,
 Speak love to me and soon.
 
 Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
 Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
 No desire, no ambition leads me
 Maybe it's because nobody needs me
 Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
 Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
 Maybe it's because nobody loves me
 Spring is here I hear
 
 Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
 Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
 No desire, no ambition leads me
 Maybe it's because nobody needs me
 Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
 Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
 Maybe it's because nobody loves me
 Spring is here I hear
 
 Let's build a stairway to the stars
 And climb that stairway to the stars
 With love beside us to fill the night with a song
 We'll hear the sound of violins
 Out yonder where the blue begins
 The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
 Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
 Over the rim of the hill?
 Can't we sail away on a little dream 
 And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
 Let's build a stairway to the stars
 A lovely stairway to the stars
 
 And now the purple dusk of twilight time
 Steals across the meadows of my heart
 High up in the sky the little stars climb
 Always reminding me that we're apart
 You wander down the lane and far away
 Leaving me a song that will not die
 Love is now the stardust of yesterday
 The music of the years gone by.
 
 Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
 The lonely nights
 Dreaming of a song
 The melody 
 Haunts my reverie
 And I am once again with you
 When our love was new 
 And each kiss an inspiration
 But that was long ago
 And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
 
 Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
 You are in my arms
 The nightingale 
 Tells his fairytale
 Of paradise, where roses grew
 Though I dream in vain
 In my heart it will remain
 My stardust melody
 The memory of love's refrain.
 
 
 
 You look at me and wonder, you look at me and doubt,
 Darling your eyes are asking, "Will the flame burn out?"
 Well, no one is sure of sun shine, no one is sure of dawn,
 But I am sure my love will live on and  on.
 I'll be tired of you  when stars are tired of gleaming
 When I am tired of dreaming, then I'll be tired of  you.
 This I know is true, when winds are tired of blowing,
 When grass is tired of growing, then I'll be tired  of you.
 
 Beyond the years, 
 'Til day is night, 'til wrong is right,
 'Til birds refuse to sing,
 Beyond the years, the echo of my only love 
 Will still be whispering, whispering.
 And if my throbbing heart should ever start repeating 
 That it is tired of beating, then I'll be tired of you.
 
 
 Too young to go steady, too young
 I hear him  say.
 He  says I'm  not ready
 But then why am I  feeling this way?
 
 Too young so he  tells me
 He  says we'll have to wait.
 Why wait till it may be too late?
 
 Can't he  realize he  drive me wild
 Is he  made of stone?
 Must he  always treat me  like a child?
 
 Won't he  ever own up
 I'm  grown up?
 Some day he'll  be sorry
 Some day just wait and see
 He'll  wish he'd  gone steady with me!  
 
 Spending these lonesome evenings
 With nothing to do
 But to live in dreams that I make up
 All by myself
 
 Dreaming that you're beside me
 I picture the prettiest stories
 Only to wake up
 All by myself
 
 What is the good of me by myself?
 
 Why was I born
 Why am I living
 What do I get
 What am I giving
 
 Why do I want a thing
 I daren't hope for
 What can I hope for
 I wish I knew
 
 Why do I try
 To draw you near me
 Why do I do I cry
 You never hear me
 
 I'm a poor fool
 But what can I do
 Why was I born
 To love you
 
 I'm a poor fool
 But what can I do
 Why was I born
 To love you
 
 You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
 And I am a fool for beauty
 Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
 I could have bound you too
 
 You are too beautiful for one man alone
 For one lucky fool to be with
 When there are other men
 With eyes of their own to see with
 
 Love does not stand sharing
 Not if one cares
 Have you been comparing
 My every kiss with theirs
 
 If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
 It's not through a sense of duty
 You are too beautiful
 And I am a fool for beauty
 
 Love does not stand sharing
 Not if one cares
 Have you been comparing
 My every kiss with theirs
 
 If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
 It's not through a sense of duty
 You are too beautiful
 And I am a fool for beauty
 
 Do I want you? 
 Oh my do I 
 Honey, indeed I do 
 
 Do I need you? 
 Oh my do I 
 Honey, a-deed I do 
 
 I'm glad that I'm the one who found you 
 That's why I'm always hangin' around you 
 
 Do I love you? 
 Oh my do I 
 Honey, deed I do
 
 I'm glad that I'm the one who found you 
 That's why I'm always hangin' around you 
 
 Do I love you? 
 Oh my do I 
 Honey, deed I do
 
 Honey, deed I do
 
 Honey, deed I do
 
 It begins to tell 'round midnight, midnight
 I do pretty well till after sundown
 Supper time I'm feelin' sad
 But it really gets bad 'round midnight
 
 Memories always start 'round midnight
 Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
 When my heart is still with you
 And ol' midnight knows it too
 
 When a quarrel we had needs mending
 Does it mean that our love is ending?
 Darlin', I need you; lately I find
 You're out of my heart and I'm out of my mind
 
 Let our hearts take wings 'round midnight, midnight
 Let the angels sing for your returning
 Till our love is safe and sound
 And old midnight comes around
 
 Feelin' sad really gets bad
 'Round, 'round, 'round midnight
 
 Don't mind telling you, in my humble fash
 That you thrill me through, with a tender pash
 When you said you care 'magine my emoshe
 I swore then and there, permanent devoshe
 
 You made all other men seem blah
 Just you alone filled me with ah
 
 'S wonderful, 's marvelous
 You should care for me
 'S awful nice, 's paradise
 'S what I love to see
 
 You've made my life so glamorous
 You can't blame me for feeling amorous
 Oh, 's wonderful, 's marvelous
 That you should care for me
 
 'S magnifique, 's what I seek
 You should care for me
 'S elegant, 's what I want
 'S what I love to see
 
 My dear, it's four leaved clover time
 From now on my heart's working overtime
 'S exceptional, 's no bagatelle
 That you should care for
 That you should care for
 That you should care for me
 
 There ain't nothing I can do or nothing I can say
 That folks don't criticize me
 But I'm goin' to do just as I want to anyway
 And don't care if they all despise me
 If I should take a notion
 To jump into the ocean
 'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do, do
 If I go to church on Sunday
 Then just sing the shimmy down on Monday
 Ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do
 If my friend ain't got no money
 And I say, "take all mine, honey"
 'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do, do
 If I give him my last nickel
 And it leaves me in a pickle
 'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do
 I'd rather my man would hit me
 Than to jump up right and quit me
 'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do, do
 I swear I won't call no copper
 If I'm beat up by my poppa
 If I'm beat up by my poppa
 'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do
 
 When I was a kid about half past three
 My ma said, "Daughter, come here to me"
 Says, "Things may come and things may go
 But this is one thing you ought to know"
 
 Oh, 'tain't what you do; it's the way that you do it
 'Tain't what you do; it's the way that you do it
 'Tain't what you do; it's the way that you do it
 That's what gets results
 
 'Tain't what you do; it's the time that you do it
 'Tain't what you do; it's the time that you do it
 'Tain't what you do; it's the time that you do it
 That's what gets results
 
 You can try hard, don't mean a thing
 Take it easy, breezy, then your jive will swing
 
 Oh, it 'tain't what you do; it's the place that you do it
 'Tain't what you do; it's the time that you do it
 'Tain't what you do; it's the way that you do it
 That's what gets results
 
 You've learned your A B C's
 You've learned your D F G's
 But this is something you don't learn in school
 
 So get your hep boots on
 And then you'll carry on
 But remember if you try too hard
 It don't mean a thing, take it easy
 
 'Tain't what bring do; it's the way that you bring it
 'Tain't what swing do; it's the way that you swing it
 'Tain't what sing do; it's the way that you sing it
 That's what gets results
 
 That's what gets results, rebop
 
 Old Father Time checked so there'd be no doubt
 Called on the north wind to come on out
 Then cupped his hands so proudly to shout
 "La-de-da de-la-de-dum, 'tis autumn"
 
 The trees say they're tired they bore too much fruit
 Charmed all the wayside there's no dispute
 Now shedding leaves they don't give a hoot
 La-de-da de-la-de-dum, 'tis autumn
 
 Then the birds got together
 To chirp about the weather
 
 After makin' their decision
 In birdie-like precision
 Turned about and made a bee-line to the south
 
 My holding you close is really no crime
 Ask the birds the trees and Old Father Time
 It's just to help the mercury climb
 La-de-da de-la-de-dum, 'tis autumn
 
 Then the birds got together
 To chirp about the weather
 
 After makin' their decision
 In birdie-like precision
 Turned about and made a bee-line to the south
 
 My holding you close is really no crime
 Ask the birds the trees and old Father Time
 It's just to help the mercury climb
 La-de-da de-la-de-dum
 La-de-da de-la-de-dum
 La-de-da de-la-de-dum, 'tis autumn
 
 I love you for sentimental reasons
 I hope you do believe me
 I'll give you my heart
 
 I love you and you alone were meant for me
 Please, give your loving heart to me
 And say we'll never part
 
 I think of you every morning
 Dream of you every night
 Darling, I'm never lonely
 Whenever you are in sight
 
 I love you for sentimental reasons
 I hope you do believe me
 I've given you my heart
 
 I love you for sentimental reasons
 I hope you do believe me
 I've given you my heart
 
 Some folks were meant to live in clover,
 But they are such a chosen few
 And clover being green is something I've never seen
 Cause I was born to be blue
 
 When there's a yellow moon above me,
 They say there's moonbeams I should view
 But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold
 Cause I was born to be blue
 
 When I met you the world was bright and sunny
 When you left the curtain fell
 I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny
 Now my world's a faded pastel
 
 Well, I guess I'm luckier than some folks,
 I've known the thrill of loving you
 And that alone is more than I was created for
 Cause I was born to be blue
 
 At any gambling casino
 From Monte Carlo to Reno
 They tell you that a beginner
 Comes out a winner
 
 Beginner fishing for flounder
 Will catch a 17 pounder
 That's what I always heard
 And thought absurd,
 
 But now, I believe every word
 For I've got beginner's luck
 The first time that I'm in love
 I'm in love with you
 
 Gosh, I'm lucky
 I've got beginner's luck
 There never was such a smile
 Or such eyes of blue
 
 Gosh, I'm fortunate
 The thing we've begun
 Is much more than a pastime
 For this time is the one
 
 Where the first time is the last time
 I've got beginner's luck
 Lucky, through and through
 'Cause the first time that I'm in love
 
 I'm in love with you
 
 The thing we've begun
 Is much more than a pastime
 For this time is the one
 Where the first time is the last time
 
 I've got beginner's luck
 Lucky, through and through
 'Cause the first time that I'm in love
 Yes, the first time that I'm in love
 Oh, the first time that I'm in love
 
 I'm in love with you
 I'm in love with you
 I'm in love with you
 I'm in love with you
 
 Mister Paganini, please play my rhapsody
 And if you cannot play it, won't you sing it
 And if you can't sing it, you simply have to
 Swing it
 I said swing it
 Oh-oh-oh swing it
 And don't ding it
 Oh mister Paganini, we breathlessly await
 Your masterful d'tente, go-o on and sling it
 And if you can't sling it
 You'll simply have to swing it
 I said swing it
 And scattywahwah
 And wahdyscatla
 We've heard your repertoire and
 At the final bar
 We've greeted you with wild applause
 But what a great ovation
 Your interpretation
 Pat-scoodle-atty-doody yeah yeah yeah
 Oh Mister Paganini, now don't you be a meanie
 What have you up your sleeve, go on and spring it
 And if you can't spring it, you'll simply have to
 Swing it
 
 You see a pair of laughing eyes
 And suddenly you're sighing sighs
 You're thinking nothing's wrong
 You string along, boy, then snap
 
 Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
 
 You're hand-in-hand beneath the trees
 And soon there's music in the breeze
 You're acting kind of smart until your heart just goes wap
 
 Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
 
 Some starry night when her kisses make you tingle
 Shell hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single
 
 And all at once it seems so nice
 The folks are throwing shoes and rice
 You hurry to a spot that's just a dot on the map
 
 You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
 
 Some starry night when her kisses make you tingle
 Shell hold you tight, and youll hate yourself for being single
 
 And all at once it seems so nice
 The folks are throwing shoes and rice
 You hurry to a spot thats just a dot on the map
 
 And then you wonder how it all came about
 Its too late now; there's no gettin' out
 You fell in love, and love is the tender trap
 
 You say you love me
 You swear that you do
 But how can you love me
 And be so untrue?
 Oh, oh, what do you know about love?
 
 You say you mean it
 How happy we'll be
 But how can you mean it
 And be mean to me?
 Oh, oh, what do you know about love?
 
 It's funny
 When you hold me tight
 It thrills me so much it's a sin
 But, honey
 When you hold me tight
 This isn't love; it's the mood that you're in
 
 I'd like to believe you
 That we'll never part
 How can I believe you
 When you break my heart?
 Oh, oh, what do you know about love?
 
 It's funny
 When you hold me tight
 It thrills me so much it's a sin
 But, honey
 When you hold me tight
 This isn't love; it's the mood that you're in
 
 I'd like to believe you
 That we'll never part
 How can I believe you
 When you break my heart?
 Oh, oh, oh, what do you know about love?
 
 Darlin', you say we'll never part
 You'll mend a broken heart
 I'd like to believe you
 That we'll never part
 How can I believe you
 When you break my heart?
 But what do you know about love?
 
 This is the end of a beautiful friendship
 It ended a moment ago
 This is the end of a beautiful friendship
 I know
 'Cause your eyes told me so
 
 We've always been
 Like sister and brother
 Until tonight
 When we looked at each other
 
 That was the end of a beautiful friendship
 And just the beginning of love
 
 That was the end of a beautiful friendship
 And just the beginning of love
 
 One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
 One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
 One little heartache left as a token
 One little plaything carelessly broken
 
 Remember the night
 The night you said, "I love you"
 Remember?
 
 Remember you vowed
 By all the stars above you
 Remember?
 
 Remember we found a lonely spot
 And after I learned to care a lot
 
 You promised that you'd forget me not
 But you forgot
 To remember
 
 Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
 You loved me too; my dreams had come true, and all the world was May
 But soon the May-time turned to December
 You had forgotten; do you remember?
 
 When the rhythm gets to rockin' on the swing side
 And the cats condescend to lend an ear
 When the beatniks start to gather 'round the ringside
 There's a certain thing they always want to hear
 Seven-twenty, seven-twenty in the books
 
 What's the tune they like the best
 When the jive becomes deluxe?
 What's the number one request?
 Seven-twenty in the books
 
 When the band begins to play
 You should see the dirty looks
 If the leader doesn't say
 Seven-twenty in the books
 
 It's something that you'll approve
 Gets you right in the groove
 To keep in step
 You really gotta be hep
 
 Just be like the kangaroo
 Or the fishes in the brooks
 Ev'rybody's jumpin' to
 Seven-twenty in the books
 
 It's something that you'll approve
 Gets you out of the groove
 To keep in step
 You really gotta be hep
 
 Just be like the kangaroo
 Or the fishes in the brooks
 Ev'rybody's jumpin' to
 Seven-twenty in the books
 
 Seven-twenty
 Seven-twenty
 Seven-twenty
 Let's keep jumpin' to seven-twenty in the books
 
 Tristeza n'o tem fim 
 Felicidade sim 
 
 A felicidade ' como a gota 
 De orvalho numa p'tala de flor 
 Brilha tranquila 
 Depois de leve oscila 
 E cai como uma l'grima de amor 
 
 A felicidade do pobre parece 
 A grande ilus'o do carnaval 
 A gente trabalha o ano inteiro 
 Por um momento de sonho 
 Pra fazer a fantasia 
 De rei ou de pirata ou jardineira 
 Pra tudo se acabar na quarta feira 
 
 Tristeza n'o tem fim 
 Felicidade sim 
 
 A felicidade ' como a pluma 
 Que o vento vai levando pelo ar 
 Voa t'o leve 
 Mas tem a vida breve 
 Precisa que haja vento sem parar 
 
 A minha felicidade est' sonhando 
 Nos olhos da minha namorada 
 ' como esta noite 
 Passando, passando 
 Em busca da madrugada 
 Falem baixo, por favor 
 Pr' que ela acorde alegre como o dia 
 Oferecendo beijos de amor 
 
 Tristeza n'o tem fim 
 Felicidade sim
 
 A fine romance, with no kisses
 A fine romance, my friend this is
 We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
 But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
 
 A fine romance, you won't nestle
 A fine romance, you won't wrestle
 I might as well play bridge
 With my old maid aunt
 I haven't got a chance
 This is a fine romance
 
 A fine romance, with no kisses
 A fine romance, my friend this is
 We two should be like clams in a dish of chowder
 But we just fizz like parts of seidlitz powder
 
 Yes, a fine romance, with no glitches
 A fine romance, with no beaches
 Just as hard to land as the Isle de France
 I haven't got a chance
 This is a fine romance
 
 A fine romance, my good fellow
 You take romance, I'll take jello
 You're calmer than the seals
 In the arctic ocean
 At least they flap their fins
 To express emotion
 
 A fine romance with no quarrels
 With no insults and all morals
 I've never mussed the crease
 In your blue serge pants
 I never get the chance
 This is a fine romance
 
 Yes, a fine romance, my dear judges
 Two old fogies who need crutches
 True love should have the thrills
 That a healthy crime has
 Oh we don't have the thrills
 That the march of time has
 
 A fine romance, my good woman
 My strong aged in the wood, woman
 You never give the orchids I sent a glance
 No you like cactus plants
 This is a fine romance
 
 A fine romance, my dear duchess
 Two old fogies who need crutches
 True love should have the thrills
 That a healthy crime has
 You know Louie we don't have half the thrills
 That the march of time has
 
 You're telling me
 Fine romance, my very good woman
 My strong aged in the wood woman
 You never give the orchids I sent a glance
 No I prefer cactus plants
 This is a fine romance
 
 I was a stranger in the city
 Out of town were the people I knew
 I had that feeling of self pity
 What to do, what to do, what to do
 The outlook was decidedly blue
 
 But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
 It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known
 
 A foggy day, in London town
 Had me low, had me down
 I viewed the morning, with alarm
 British museum, had lost its charm
 
 How long I wondered
 Could this thing last
 But the age of miracles, hadn't past
 For suddenly, I saw you there
 And through foggy London town
 The sun was shining everywhere
 
 For suddenly, I saw you there
 And through foggy London town
 The sun was shining everywhere
 
 Everywhere
 Everywhere
 Everywhere
 
 It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
 It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
 But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
 Will make me feel alright
 
 You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
 And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
 So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
 You know I feel OK
 
 When I'm home everything seems to be right
 When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight
 
 It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
 It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
 But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
 Will make me feel alright, ow
 
 So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
 You know I feel OK
 
 When I'm home everything seems to be right
 When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight
 
 It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
 It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
 But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
 Will make me feel alright
 You know I feel alright
 You know I feel alright
 
 Doo doo doo doo doo
 Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
 Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 
 A chair is still a chair even when there's no one sittin' there
 But a chair is not a house and a house is not a home
 When there's no one there to hold you tight
 And no one there you can kiss goodnight
 
 Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 Girl
 
 A room is a still a room even when there's nothin' there but gloom
 But a room is not a house and a house is not a home
 When the two of us are far apart
 And one of us has a broken heart
 
 Now and then I call your name
 And suddenly your face appears
 But it's just a crazy game
 When it ends, it ends in tears
 
 Pretty little darling, have a heart: don't let one mistake keep us apart
 I'm not meant to live alone, turn this house into a home
 When I climb the stairs and turn the key
 Oh, please be there, sayin' that you're still in love with me, yeah
 
 I'm not meant to live alone, turn this house into a home
 When I climb the stairs and turn the key
 Oh, please be there, still in love
 I said, still in love
 Still in love with you, yeah
 
 Are you gonna be in love with me?
 I want you and need to be, yeah
 Still in love with me
 Say you're gonna be in love with me
 It's drivin' me crazy to think that, my baby
 Couldn't be still in love with me
 
 Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
 Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
 Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
 Well, well, well, well
 Still in love, so in love, still in love with me
 Are you gonna be?
 Say that you're gonna be
 
 Still in love with me, yeah
 With me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 Still in love with me, yeah, yeah
 
 A kiss goodnight is alright
 But remember this
 That a kiss goodnight leads to another kiss
 A kiss goodnight with a hug real tight
 Is nothing short of bliss
 And a kiss goodnight leads to another kiss
 It's an old custom for a boy and girl to embrace
 In some secluded place
 LIttle mister cupid never could be quite so stupid
 As to do a turn about face
 So it just ain't right to kiss goodnight
 And stop at 3 or 4
 'Cause a kiss goodnight leads to a dozen or more
 
 It's an old custom for a boy and girl to embrace
 In some secluded place
 Little mister cupid never could be quite so stupid
 As to do a turn about face
 So a kiss goodnight is alright
 But remember this
 That a kiss goodnight leads to another kiss
 
 If you like me like I like you
 Don't stand there at the door knock knock
 A kiss goodnight and hug real tight
 And we'll run into a dozen more
 
 Give me a kiss to build a dream on
 And my imagination will thrive upon that kiss
 Sweetheart, I ask no more than this
 A kiss to build a dream on
 
 Give me a kiss before you leave me
 And my imagination will feed my hungry heart
 Leave me one thing before we part
 A kiss to build a dream on
 
 And when I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you
 Weaving romances, making believe they're true
 
 Oh, give me your lips for just a moment
 And my imagination will make that moment live
 Give me what you alone can give
 A kiss to build a dream on
 
 When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you
 Weaving romances, making believe they're true
 
 Oh, give me lips for just a moment
 And my imagination will make that moment live
 Oh, give me what you alone can give
 A kiss to build a dream on
 
 A little bit later on
 A little bit later on
 Just wait and you'll see
 How lonely you'll be
 A little bit later on
 
 Just wait till you start missin'
 My huggin' and my kissin'
 Now, baby, better listen
 You'll be cryin', boo, hoo, hoo
 
 A little bit later on
 You're gonna wake up some day
 And open your eyes
 To a great big surprise, baby
 
 Don't forget it
 You'll regret it
 After I'm gone
 
 You'd better think twice
 It won't be so nice
 A little bit later on
 
 Oh, a little bit later on
 Say you're gonna wake up some day
 And open your eyes
 To a great big surprise, my baby
 
 Don't forget it
 You'll regret it
 After I'm gone
 
 You'd better think twice
 It won't be so nice
 A little bit later on
 
 Yesterday we were gay
 I was high on a rainbow
 But now there's no rainbow
 You've gone and so a lover is blue
 
 Life was sweet, so complete
 Now I've suddenly wakened
 To find I'm forsaken
 Alone and so a lover is blue
 
 Do you still remember our love affair?
 Does it matter to you?
 But I'll have to go through our door to care
 
 Here and there everywhere
 Every scene just reminds me
 Of something that binds me
 To you and so a lover is blue
 
 The moon is the same moon above you
 Aglow with it's cool evening light
 But shining at night, in Tunisia
 Never does it shine so bright
 
 The stars are aglow in the heavens
 But only the wise understand
 That shining at night in Tunisia
 They guide you through the desert sand
 
 Words fail, to tell a tale
 Too exotic to be told
 Each night's a deeper night
 In a world, ages old
 
 The cares of the day seem to vanish
 The ending of day brings release
 Each wonderful night in Tunisia
 Where the nights are filled with peace
 
 Each wonderful night in Tunisia
 
 I don't know what day it is
 Or if it's dark or fair
 Somehow, that's just the way it is
 And I don't really care
 
 I go to this or that place
 I seem alive and well
 My head is just a hat place
 My breast an empty shell
 And I've a faded dream to sell
 
 All alone, all at sea
 Why does nobody care for me?
 When there's no love to hold my love
 Why is my heart so frail?
 Like a ship without a sail.
 
 Out on the ocean,
 Sailors can use a chart
 I'm on the ocean
 Guided by just a lonely heart
 
 Still alone, still at sea
 Still there's no one to care for me
 When there's no hand to hold my hand
 Life is a loveless tale
 For a ship without a sail
 
 Still alone, still at sea
 Still there's no one to care for me
 When there's no hand to hold my hand
 Life is a loveless tale
 For a ship without a sail
 
 I want a Sunday kind of love
 A love to last past Saturday night 
 And I'd like to know it's more than love at first sight
 I want a Sunday kind of love oh yeah
 
 I want a love that's on the square
 Can't seem to find somebody someone to care
 And I'm on a lonely road that leads to nowhere 
 I need a Sunday kind of love
 
 I do all my Sunday dreaming
 And all my Sunday scheming
 Every minute, every hour, every day
 And I'm hopin' to discover
 A certain kind of lover
 Who will show me the way
 And my arms need someone to enfold 
 To help keep me warm 
 When Mondays, and Tuesdays grow cold
 And I need a love for all my life
 To have and to hold
 I need a Sunday kind of love
 
 I do all my Sunday dreaming
 And all my Sunday scheming
 Every minute, every hour, every day
 And I'm hopin' to discover
 A certain kind of lover
 Who will show me the way
 And my arms need someone to enfold 
 To help keep me warm 
 When Mondays, and Tuesdays grow cold
 And I need a love for all my life
 To have and to hold
 I need a Sunday kind of love
 
 I don't want a Monday or a Tuesday
 A Wednesday or a Thursday
 Friday or Saturday
 I don't want nothin' baby
 I want a Sunday kind of love
 
 What, that chile ain`t asleep yet? Give him to me.
 I`ll fix him for you.
 
 Lissen to yo` daddy warn you,
 `Fore you start a-travelling,
 Woman may born you, love you and mourn you,
 But a woman is a sometime thing,
 Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
 
 Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.
 
 Yo` mammy is the first to name you,
 Then she`ll tie you to her apron string,
 Then she`ll shame you and she`ll blame you
 Till yo` woman comes to claim you,
 `Cause a woman is a sometime thing,
 Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
 
 Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.
 
 Don`t you never let a woman grieve you
 Just 'cause she got yo` weddin` ring.
 She`ll love you and deceive you,
 Take yo` clothes and leave you
 `Cause a woman is a sometime thing.
 
 Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
 Yes, a woman is a sometime thing,
 Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
 
 There now, what I tells you; he`s asleep already.
 
 A-tisket, a-tasket
 A green and yellow basket
 I send a letter to my mommy
 On the way I dropped it
 
 I dropped it, I dropped it
 Yes, on the way I dropped it
 A little girlie picked it up
 And took put it in her pocket
 
 She was truckin' on down the avenue
 Without a single thing to do
 She went peck, peck, peckin' all around
 When she spied it on the ground
 
 She took it, she took it
 She took my yellow basket
 And if she doesn't bring it back
 I think that I would die
 
 A-tisket, a-tasket
 A green and yellow basket
 And if that girlie don't return it
 Don't know what I'll do
 
 Oh dear, I wonder where my basket can be
 Oh gee, I wish that little girl I could see
 Oh, why was I so careless with that basket of mine
 That itty-bitty basket was a joy of mine
 
 A-tisket, a-tasket
 I lost my yellow basket
 Won't someone help me find my basket
 And make me happy again
 
  no no no no
  no no no no
  no no no no
 Just a little yellow basket
 
 A little yellow basket
 
 Gather 'round me, everybody
 Gather 'round me while I preach some
 Feel a sermon comin' on me
 The topic will be sin
 And that's what I'm agin
 If you want to hear my story
 Then settle back and just sit tight
 While I start reviewing
 The attitude of doing right
 
 You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
 E-lim-i-nate the negative
 And latch on to the affirmative
 Don't mess with mister inbetween
 
 You got to spread joy up to the maximum
 Bring gloom down to the minimum
 Have faith, or pandemonium
 Liable to walk upon the scene
 
 To illustrate my last remark
 Jonah in the whale
 Noah in the ark,
 What did they do
 Just when everything looked so dark? 
 Man, they said, we better
 
 Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
 E-lim-i-nate the negative
 And latch on to the affirmative
 Don't mess with mister inbetween
 Don't, don't mess with mister inbetween
 
 To illustrate my last remark
 Jonah in a whale
 Noah in the ark,
 What did they do
 Just when everything looked so dark? 
 Man, they said, we better
 
 Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
 E-lim-i-nate the negative
 Latch on to the affirmative
 Don't mess with mister inbetween
 No don't mess with mister inbetween
 
 Sad times, may follow your tracks
 Bad times, may bar you from Sak's
 At times, when Satan in slacks
 Breaks down your self-control
 
 Maybe, as often it goes
 Your Abie, may tire of his rose
 So baby, this rule I propose
 Always have an ace in the hole
 
 Sad times, may follow your tracks
 Bad times, may bar you from Sak's
 At times, when Satan in slacks
 Breaks down your self control

 Your Abie, may tire of his rose
 So baby, this rule I propose
 Always have an ace in the hole
 
 Always have an ace in the hole
 
 
 
 This couldn't happen again
 This is that once in a lifetime
 This is the thrill divine
 What's more, this never happened before
 Though I have prayed for a lifetime
 That such as you would suddenly be mine
 Mine to hold as I"m holding you now and yet never so near
 Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
 What matters, dear, for when
 This doesn't happen again
 We'll have this moment forever
 But never, never, again
 
 Again, this couldn't happen again
 This is that once in a lifetime
 This is the thrill divine
 What's more, this never happened before
 Though I have prayed for a lifetime
 That such as you would suddenly be mine
 Mine to hold as I"m holding you now and yet never so near
 Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
 What matters, dear, for when
 This doesn't happen again
 We'll have this moment forever
 
 No one to talk with
 All by myself
 No one to walk with
 But I'm happy on the shelf
 Ain't misbehavin'
 I'm savin' my love for you
 
 I know for certain
 The one I love
 I'm through with flirtin'
 It's just you I'm thinkin' of
 Ain't misbehavin'
 I'm savin' my love for you
 
 Like Jack Horner
 In the corner
 Don't go nowhere
 What do I care?
 Your kisses are worth waitin' for
 Believe me
 
 I don't stay out late
 Don't care to go
 I'm home about eight
 Just me and my radio
 Ain't misbehavin'
 I'm savin' my love for you
 
 Like Jack Horner
 In the corner
 Don't go nowhere
 What do I care?
 Your kisses are worth waitin' for
 Believe me
 
 I don't stay out late
 Don't care to go
 I'm home about eight
 Just me and my radio
 Ain't misbehavin'
 I'm savin' my love for you
 
 You got a gal you love on Sunday
 Then you get another for Monday
 
 Ain't nobody's business but my own
 
 You say you're always home alone
 How come I can't get you on the phone?
 
 Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own
 
 Nobody's business
 Nobody's business
 Nobody's business but my own
 Nobody's business
 Nobody's business
 Nobody's business but my own
 
 All night long you're playin' poker
 Tell me, what's the name of that joker?
 
 Ain't nobody's business but my own
 
 I come over, say, "Here I am"
 Then I hear the back door slam
 
 Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own
 
 Nobody's business
 Nobody's business
 Nobody's business but my own
 Nobody's business
 Nobody's business
 Nobody's business but my own
 
 You tell me you're in bed by seven
 But your light's on past eleven
 
 Well, that ain't nobody's business but my own
 
 Now you ain't so smart and you ain't good lookin'
 How come you got so much cookin'?
 
 Ain't nobody's business but my own
 
 And you wear the prettiest ties and collars
 Whereabouts do you get those dollars?
 
 Ain't nobody's business but my own
 
 You always talk about settlin' down
 When I bring a ring, you're not around
 
 Well, I'll be there the next time that you call
 
 Well, let's not fuss and let's not fight
 
 I'm sick and tired of sayin' goodnight
 
 Well, let's make up and hold each other tight
 
 We both know we're birds of a feather
 Let's go into business together
 We can start a business of our own
 
 Left New York this morning early
 Traveling south so wide and high
 Sailing through the wide blue yonder
 It's that Airmail Special on the fly
 
 Listen to the motors humming
 She is streaking through the sky
 Like a bird that's flying homeward
 It's that Airmail Special on the fly
 
 Over plains and high dark mountains
 Over rivers deep and wide
 Carrying mail to California
 It's that Airmail Special on the fly
 
 Watch her circle for the landing
 Hear her moan and cough and sigh
 Now she's coming down the runway
 It's that Airmail Special on the fly
 
 Come on and hear , alexander's ragtime band,
 Come on and hear , it's the best band in the land!
 They can play a bugle call like you never heard before,
 So natural that you want to go to war--
 That's just the bestest band what am, honey lamb!
 Come on along , let me take you by the hand
 Up to the man , who's the leader of the band,
 And if you want to hear the swanee river played in ragtime
 Come on and hear , alexander's ragtime band!
 
 What's it all about, Alfie?
 Is it just for the moment we live?
 What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?
 Are we meant to take more than we give
 Or are we meant to be kind?
 
 And if only fools are kind, Alfie
 Then I guess it is wise to be cruel
 And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
 What will you lend on an old golden rule?
 
 As sure as I believe
 There's a heaven above, Alfie
 I know, I know there's something much more
 Something even non-believers can believe in
 
 I believe in love, Alfie
 Without true love we just exist, Alfie
 Until you find the love you've missed
 You're nothing, Alfie
 
 When you walk, let your heart lead the way
 And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie
 
 I'm so unhappy
 What'll I do? 
 I long for somebody who
 Will sympathize with me
 I'm growing so tired of living alone
 I lie awake all night and cry
 Nobody loves me
 That's why
 
 All by myself in the morning
 All by myself in the night
 
 I sit alone with a table and a chair
 So unhappy there
 Playing solitaire
 
 All by myself I get lonely
 Watching the clock on the shelf
 
 I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
 I hate to grow older
 All by myself
 
 Sometimes when I'm down and alone
 I feel just like a child with out a home
 The love you give me keeps me hangin' on, honey
 All I'll ever need is you
 
 You're my first love, you're my last
 You're my future, you're my past
 Oh, loving you is all I ask, honey
 All I'll ever need is you
 
 Winters come and then they go
 And we watch the melting snow
 Sure, Summer follows Spring, all the things you do
 Give me a reason to build my world around you
 
 Some men follow rainbows I am told
 Some men search for silver, some for gold
 But I found my treasures in my soul
 And all I'll ever need is you
 
 Without love I'd never find the way
 Through ups and downs of every single day
 And I won't sleep at night until you say
 Honey, all I'll ever need is you
 
 La, la, la, la, la, la
 The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
 Honey, all I'll ever need is you
 
 La, la, la, la, la, la
 But I found my treasures in my soul
 Honey, and all I'll ever need is you
 
 La, la, la, la, la, la
 
 All my life
 I've been waiting for you
 My wonderful one, I've begun
 Living all my life
 
 All my love
 Has been waiting for you
 My life is sublime, now that I'm
 Living all my love
 
 You seem so lovely, so far above me
 I'm almost afraid to look
 But I adore you; I pledge before you
 A heart that's an open book
 
 All my life
 Hold me close to your heart
 But all else above, hold my love
 Darling, just hold my love
 
 All my life
 I've been waiting for you
 My wonderful one, I've begun
 Living all my life
 
 All my love
 Has been waiting for you
 My life is sublime, now that I'm
 Living all my love
 
 You seem so lovely, so far above me
 I'm almost afraid to look
 But I adore you; I pledge before you
 A heart that's an open book
 
 All my life
 Hold me close to your heart
 But all else above, hold my love
 Darling, just hold my love
 
 All of me, why not take all of me?
 Baby, can't you see I'm no good without you?
 Take my lips, I'll never use them
 Take my arms, I want to lose them
 
 Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
 Tell me how can I go on, dear, without you?
 You took the part that once was my heart
 So why not take all of me?
 
 All of me, why not take all of me?
 Can't you see I'm no good without you?
 Take my lips, I want to lose 'em
 Take my arms, I'll never use them
 
 Your g-g-goodbye left me with eyes that cry
 How can I go on, dear, without you?
 You took the part that once was my heart
 So why not take all of me?
 
 Come on and take, take all of me
 
 Time and again I've longed for adventure,
 Something to make my heart beat the faster.
 What did I long for? I never really knew.
 Finding your love I've found my adventure,
 Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
 All that I want in all of this world is you.
 
 You are the promised kiss of springtime
 That makes the lonely winter seem long.
 You are the breathless hush of evening
 That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
 
 You are the angel glow that lights a star,
 The dearest things I know are what you are.
 Some day my happy arms will hold you,
 And some day I'll know that moment divine,
 When all the things you are, are mine!
 
 I love the looks of you
 The lure of you
 The sweet of you
 The pure of you
 The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
 The east, west, north, and the south of you
 I'd love to gain complete control of you
 And handle even the heart and soul of you
 So love at least a small percent of me, do
 For I love all of you
 
 I'd love to gain complete control of you
 And handle even the heart and soul of you
 So love at least a small percent of me, do
 For I love all of you
 
 All or nothing at all
 Half a love never appealed to me
 If your heart never could yield to me
 Then I'd rather  have nothing at all
 
 All or nothing at all
 If it's love, there is no in-between
 Why begin, then cry for something that might have been?
 No, I'd rather  have nothing at all
 
 But, please, don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
 Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
 The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
 And my heart may go dizzy and fall
 
 And if I fell  under the spell of your call
 I would be caught in the undertow
 So, you see, I've got to say no, no
 All or nothing at all
 
 I'm in love with you
 And all that jazz
 You're my dream come true
 And all that jazz
 Baby, you're too much
 You've got the skin I love to touch
 The skin I love to touch too much, mmm
 And all that jazz
 You have got the lips that suit my taste
 And your fingertips can't be replaced
 Oh, baby, what you've got, nobody has
 And I've got you
 And all that jazz
 
 I said I'm in love with you
 And all that jazz
 You're my dream come true
 And all that jazz
 Baby, you're too much
 You've got the skin I love to touch
 The skin I love to touch too much, mmm
 And all that jazz
 You have got the lips that suit my taste
 And your fingertips can't be replaced
 Oh, baby, what you've got, nobody has
 And I've got you
 And all that jazz
 
 All the live-long day and the long, long night
 What do I do?  Dream about you
 Felt this way the first time you came in sight
 Suddenly my gloomy old sky turned magically bright
 
 You'll find I'm perfect casting opposite you
 You'll find love everlasting
 You're the why and wherefore
 I was born to care for
 
 All I live for now is to hold you tight
 All the live-long day and the long, long night
 
 No chance you're taking chances taking me on
 No doubt my lifelong plan says
 "You're the why and wherefore
 I was born to care for"
 
 All I live for now is to hold you tight
 All the live-long day and the long, long night
 All the live-long night
 All the live-long night
 
 Time and again I've longed for adventure,
 Something to make my heart beat the faster.
 What did I long for? I never really knew.
 Finding your love I've found my adventure,
 Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
 All that I want in all of this world is you.
 
 You are the promised kiss of springtime
 That makes the lonely winter seem long.
 You are the breathless hush of evening
 That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
 
 You are the angel glow that lights a star,
 The dearest things I know are what you are.
 Some day my happy arms will hold you,
 And some day I'll know that moment divine,
 When all the things you are, are mine!
 
 The day is my enemy, the night my friend
 For I'm always so alone
 'Till the day draws to an end
 But when the sun goes down
 And the moon comes through
 To the monotone of the evening's drone
 I'm all alone with you
 
 All through the night
 I delight in your love
 All through the night
 You're so close to me
 All through the night
 From a height far above
 You and your love brings me ecstasy
 
 When dawn comes to waken me
 You're never there at all
 I know you've forsaken me
 'Till the shadows fall
 But then once again
 I can dream
 I've the right
 To be close to you
 All through the night
 
 All too soon
 We had to part
 The moment you had touched my heart
 And with you went my dream
 
 All too soon
 All too sweet
 Was our affair
 And you put all the sweetness there
 
 What a shame that it's gone
 All too soon
 I knew the strange delights
 That only you in love could bring
 
 And as I reached the heights
 The bottom fell from everything
 You should know as well as I
 Our love deserves another try
 
 For we whispered goodbye
 All too soon
 Too soon
 
 What a day this has been!
 What a rare mood I'm in!
 Why, it's almost like being in love
 
 There's a smile on my face
 For the whole human race
 Why it's almost like being in love
 
 All the music of life seems to be
 Like a bell that is ringing for me
 And from the way that I feel
 When the bell starts to peal
 I would swear I was falling
 I could swear I was falling
 It's almost like being in love
 
 Alone together, beyond the crowd
 Above the world, we're not too proud
 To cling together; we're strong
 As long as we're together
 
 Alone together, the blinding rain
 The starless night were not in vain
 For we're together, and what is there
 To fear together?
 
 Our love is as deep as the sea
 Our love is as great as a love can be
 And we can weather the great unknown
 If we're alone together
 
 Well, alright, okay, you win
 I'm in love with you
 Well, alright, okay, you win
 Baby, what can I do?
 I'll do anything you say
 It's just got to be that way
 
 Well, alright, okay, you win
 I'm in love with you
 Well, alright, okay, you win
 Baby, what can I do?
 Anything you say, I'll do
 As long as it's me and you
 
 All that I am askin'
 All I want from you
 Is just love me like I love you
 And it won't be hard to do
 
 Well, alright, okay, you win
 I'm in love with you
 Well, alright, okay, you win
 Well, baby, what can I do?
 I'll do anything you say
 Oh, it's just got to be that way
 
 All that I am askin'
 All I want from you
 Just love me like I love you
 It won't be hard to do
 
 All night, all day
 I'm in, oh, and I'm telling you
 Alright, okay, you win
 What are you waiting for?
 If you're gonna be my man
 Sweet baby, take me by the hand
 Well, alright, okay, you win
 
 I'll be loving you always
 With a love that's true always.
 When the things you've planned
 Need a helping hand,
 I will understand always.
 
 Always.
 
 Days may not be fair always,
 That's when I'll be there always.
 Not for just an hour,
 Not for just a day,
 Not for just a year,
 But always.
 
 I'll be loving you, oh always
 With a love that's true always.
 When the things you've planned
 Need a helping hand,
 I will understand always.
 
 Always.
 
 Days may not be fair always,
 That's when I'll be there always.
 Not for just an hour,
 Not for just a day,
 Not for just a year,
 But always.
 
 Not for just an hour,
 Not for just a day,
 Not for just a year,
 But always.
 
 Sweetheart if you should stray a million miles away
 I'll always be in love with you.
 Although you find more fish in someone else's dish
 I'll always be in love with you.
 
 I can't do any more, I tried so hard to please
 But let me thank you for those tender memories
 
 I wish you happiness, as for me sweetheart I guess
 I'll always be in love with you.
 
 If a custom tailored vet
 Asks me out for something wet
 When the vet begins to pet, I cry Hooray
 
 But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
 Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
 
 I've been asked to have a meal
 By a big tycoon in steel
 If the meal includes a deal, accept I may
 
 But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
 Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
 
 There's an oil man known as Tex
 Who is keen to give me checks
 And his checks, I fear, means that Tex is here to stay
 
 But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
 Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
 
 From Ohio Mister Thorn
 Calls me up from night till morn
 Mister Thorn once cornered corn and that ain't hay
 
 But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
 Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
 
 From Milwaukee Mister Fritz
 Often dines me at the Ritz
 Mister Fritz invented schlitz and schlitz must pay
 
 But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
 Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
 
 Mister Harris, plutocrat
 Wants to give my cheek a pat
 If the Harris pat means a Paris hat, pay, pay!
 
 But I'm always true to you, darlin', in my fashion
 Yes, I'm always true to you, darlin', in my way
 
 When she wakes up this morning and turns to kiss me
 She'll find I let her sleep cause we talked so late last night
 She'll know I kissed her face gently till my returning
 And when she finds the rose on my pillow I know she'll smile
 Her amazing love unending is so much more than I am worthy of
 If the rose could speak my feelings she'd know I cherished her amazing love
 
 If I call her a little late she forgives me
 Her voice does not betray she's spent another day alone
 She softly thanks me for the rose and says I miss you
 And then I can feel her smiling on the phone
 Her amazing love
 
 He would spend it on the ponies
 He would spend it on the girls
 Buy his mother gin and roses
 For her poor old hennaed curls
 And when his wife said, "Hey now
 What did you get for me?"
 He socked her in the chopper
 Such a sweet, sweet guy was he
 
 And her tears flowed like wine
 Yes, her tears flowed like wine
 She's a real sad tomato
 She's a busted valentine
 Knows her mama done told her
 That her man is darned unkind
 
 How he loved the old race horses
 He would bet them every day
 One day he caught a winner
 And the cabbage wasn't hay
 He indulged in fancy spending
 Ordered rings, cars, and furs
 But alas, alack
 Like a stab in the back
 She found out they were not hers
 
 He got mixed up with a Maisie
 He got mixed up with a Flo
 So Flo shoved him in the river
 He'll not get mixed up no more
 His wife then draped herself in black
 That showed her figure fine
 Then she cussed him out, the two-faced guy
 No insurance could she find
 
 We meet and the angels sing
 The angels sing the sweetest song I've ever heard
 You speak and the angels sing
 Or am I reading music into every word?
 
 Suddenly the setting is strange
 I can see water and moonlight beaming
 Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore 
 Then suddenly I see it all change
 Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
 Through it all your face that I adore
 
 You smile and the angels sing
 And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
 We kiss and the angels sing
 And leave their music ringing in my heart
 
 I try to think that love's not around
 But it's uncomfortably near
 My old heart ain't gaining no ground
 Because my angel eyes ain't here
 
 Angel eyes, that old devil sent
 They glow unbearably bright
 Need I say that my love's misspent
 Misspent with angel eyes tonight
 
 So drink up all you people
 Order anything you see
 Have fun you happy people
 The laughs and the jokes on me
 
 Pardon me but I got to run
 The fact's uncommonly clear
 Got to find who's now number one
 And why my angel eyes
 Oh, where is my angel eyes
 
 Excuse me while I disappear
 
 Angels we have heard on high
 Sweetly singing o'er the plain
 And the mountains in reply
 Echoing their joyous strains
 Glo-glo-glo-gloria, in excelsis deo
 Ooh, no, yeah yeah
 
 Shepards, why this jubilee
 Why your joyous song prolong
 What the gladsome tidings be, ohh
 That inspire your heavenly song
 Glo-glo-glo-gloria, in excelsis deo
 Oh oh oh, ooh oh, oh yeah
 
 Ohh, come to bethlehem and see
 Him whose birth the angels sing, oh
 Come on adore on bended knee
 Christ, the lord, our new-born king
 Glo-glo-glo-gloria, in excelsis deo, oh yeah
 
 On the day, that christ was born
 The angels sang such a heavenly song
 In excelsis deo, ohh
 
 Angels we have heard on high
 Angels we have heard on high
 Angels we have heard on high
 Angels we have heard on high
 In excelsis deo
 In excelsis deo
 
 In excelsis deo
 
 Any old time you want me
 I am yours for the asking, darling
 Any old time you need me
 I'll be there with love that's lasting, darling
 All through the years we'll stand together
 Sharing the tears and stormy weather
 And the sunshine will be yours and mine
 Any old time you're blue
 You'll have our love to chase away the blues
 And any old thing you do I'll see you through
 So just remember that I am waiting, dear
 If ever you want me, I'll be near
 Any old time and any place where you may be
 
 Times have changed
 And we've often rewound the clock
 Since the Puritans got a shock
 When they landed on Plymouth Rock
 If today
 Any shock they should try to stem
 'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock
 Plymouth Rock would land on them
 
 In olden days, a glimpse of stockings
 Was looked on as something shocking
 Now, heaven knows
 Anything goes
 Good authors too, who once knew better words
 Now only use four-letter words
 Writing prose
 Anything goes
 The world has gone mad today
 And good's bad today
 And black's white today
 And day's night today
 When most guys today
 That women prize today
 Are just silly gigolos
 
 So though I'm not a great romancer
 I know that I'm bound to answer
 When you propose
 Anything goes
 
 The world has gone mad today
 And good's bad today
 And black's white today
 And day's night today
 When most guys today
 That women prize today
 Are just silly gigolos
 
 So though I'm not a great romancer
 I know that I'm bound to answer
 When you propose
 Anything goes
 Anything goes
 
 April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
 Holiday tables under the trees
 April in Paris, this is a feeling
 No one can ever reprise
 
 I never knew the charm of spring
 Never met it face to face
 I never new my heart could sing
 Never missed a warm embrace
 
 Till April in Paris
 Whom can I run to
 What have you done to my heart
 
 Yes, April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
 Holiday tables under the trees
 April in Paris, this is a feeling
 No one can ever reprise
 
 I never knew the charm of spring
 Never met it face to face
 I never new my heart could sing
 Never missed a warm embrace
 
 Till April in Paris
 Now whom can I run to
 Oh, what have you done to my heart
 
 I never knew the charm of spring
 Never met it face to face
 I never new my heart could sing
 Never missed a warm embrace
 
 Till April in Paris
 Whom can I run to
 What have you done to my heart
 
 Oh, it really wasn't my intention
 To disregard convention
 It was just an impulse
 That had to be obeyed
 Though it seems convention we've been scorning
 I'll still not go in mourning
 Though my reputation
 Is blemished, I'm afraid
 With just one kiss
 What heaven, what rapture, what bliss
 Honestly, I thought you wouldn't
 Naturally, you thought you couldn't
 And probably we shouldn't
 But aren't you kind of glad we did?
 Actually, it all was blameless
 Nevertheless, they'll call it shameless
 So let's keep the lady nameless
 But aren't you kind of glad we did?
 Socially, I'll be an outcast
 Obviously, we dined alone
 On my good name there will be doubt cast
 With never a sign of any chaperon
 No matter how they may construe it
 Whether or not, we have to rue it
 Whatever made us do it
 Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?
 
 Whatever made us do it
 Say, aren't you kind of glad we did?
 
 Maybe I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
 Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live. 
 
 Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,
 But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live. 
 
 I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.
 That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every 
 day then see the doctor anyway. 
 
 What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
 Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live. 
 
 I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow
 I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,
 And that would never never do
 What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
 Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live.
 
 
 He stays out every night
 And leaves me all alone
 He never tells me where he goes
 I'm not the only lonely one
 Just ask a woman who knows
 We used to share our troubles
 And our good times too
 But now I'm left with all the woes
 I'm not the only sorry one
 Lord, just ask a woman who knows
 The days are long
 The nights are longer
 I've got the lonesomest blues
 You know my only consolation
 Is I ain't got nothing more to lose
 So there you've got the story 
 Of a love gone wrong
 That used to blossom like a rose
 I'm not the only broken heart
 Mmm, ask a woman who knows
 Well my only consolation
 Is I got nothing more to lose
 So there you have the story
 Of a love gone wrong
 That used to blossom like a rose
 But I'm not the only broken heart
 Just ask a woman
 And I'm a woman
 Just ask a woman who knows
 
 At last, my love has come along
 my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
 At last,the skies above are blue
 My heart was wrapped in clover
 Every since the night I looked at you
 
 And I found a dream that I could speak to
 A dream to call my own
 I found a thrill to press my cheek to
 A thrill I'd never known
 When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
 And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last
 
 I found a dream that I could speak to,
 A dream  to call my own
 I found a thrill to press my cheek to
 A thrill like I had never known
 You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
 And here we are in Heaven
 I found my love at last
 
 Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
 Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
 Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
 Or is what I feel the real McCoy?
 
 Is it for all-time or simply a lark?
 Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?
 Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
 Or is it at long last love?
 
 Is it an earthquake, or simply a shock?
 Is it the good turtle soup, or is it merely the mock?
 Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
 Or is what I feel the real McCoy?
 
 Is it for all-time or simply a lark?
 Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?
 Is it a fancy, not worth thinking of?
 Or is it at long, long, long last love?
 
 Autumn in New York
 Why does it seem so inviting
 Autumn in New York
 It spells the thrill of first nighting
 
 Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
 In canyons of steel
 They're making me feel I'm home
 
 It's autumn in New York
 That brings the promise of new love
 Autumn in New York
 Is often mingled with pain
 
 Dreamers with empty hands
 They sigh for exotic lands
 It's autumn in New York
 It's good to live it again
 
 Autumn in New York
 The gleaming rooftops at sundown
 Oh, autumn in New York
 It lifts you up when you run down
 
 Yes, jaded roues and gay divorcees
 Who lunch at the Ritz
 Will tell you that it's divine
 
 This autumn in New York
 Transforms the slums into Mayfair
 Oh, autumn in New York
 You'll need no castles in Spain
 
 Yes, lovers that bless the dark
 On the benches in Central Park
 Greet autumn in New York
 It's good to live it again
 
 Autumn in New York
 That brings the promise of new love
 Autumn in New York
 Is often mingled with pain
 
 Dreamers with empty hands
 They sigh for exotic lands
 It's autumn in New York
 It's good to live it again
 
 Away in a manger,
 No crib for His bed
 The little Lord Jesus
 Laid down His sweet head
 
 The stars in the bright sky
 Looked down where He lay
 The little Lord Jesus
 Asleep on the hay
 
 The cattle are lowing
 The poor Baby wakes
 But little Lord Jesus
 No crying He makes
 
 I love Thee, Lord Jesus
 Look down from the sky
 And stay by my side,
 'Til morning is nigh.
 
 Be near me, Lord Jesus,
 I ask Thee to stay
 Close by me forever
 And love me I pray
 
 Bless all the dear children
 In Thy tender care
 And take us to heaven
 To live with Thee there
 
 Driftin' Dreamin'
 In an Azure mood,
 Stardust gleamin' 
 Thru my solitude:
 Here in my seclusion, 
 You're a blue illusion 
 While I'm in this Azure interlude.
 I'm not wanted I'm so all alone;
 Always haunted
 By the dreams I own;
 But, though Im tormented
 I must be contented 
 Driftin' Dreamin' 
 In an Azure mood!
 Driftin' Dreamin'
 In an Azure mood,
 Star dust gleamin'
 Thru my solitude:
 Here in my seclusion, 
 You're a blue illusion
 While I'm in this Azure interlude!
 
 Baby doll, you wonderful baby doll
 Let's go home and tell my mother
 That I found a baby brother
 
 I am taking you off the shelf
 And showing you off myself
 
 Can't you see it now?
 You're taking me walkin'
 Holding my hand
 Oh honey, there's no use talkin'
 You're a wonderful baby doll
 
 I am taking you off the shelf
 And showing you off myself
 
 Can't you see it now?
 You're taking me walkin'
 Holding my hand
 Oh honey, there's no use talkin'
 You're a wonderful baby doll
 
 A wonderful baby doll
 
 I must confess what you say is true
 I had a rendezvous with somebody new
  that's the only one I ever had
 Baby, baby, don'cha go 'way mad
 
 Cheatin' shows and it never goes
 You've got a reason to be mad I suppose
 But she only was a passing fad
 Baby, don'cha be mad
 
 Her kind's a dime a dozen
 And that's not the kind I want 
 Who'd ever dream your cousin
 Would wander in to that restaurant ?
 
 I understand that you feel  upset
 What do you say that you forgive and forget?
 Come on and kiss me just to show your glad
 Baby, baby  don'cha go 'way mad
 
 I really can't stay
 But, baby, it's cold outside
 I got to go away
 But baby, it's cold outside
 This evening has been
 Been hoping that you'd drop in
 So very nice
 I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
 
 My mother will start to worry
 Beautiful, what's your hurry?
 And father will be pacing the floor
 Listen to the fireplace roar
 So really I'd better scurry
 Beautiful, please don't hurry
 Well, maybe just a half a drink more
 Put some records on while I pour
 
 The neighbors might think
 But baby, it's bad out there
 Say, what's in this drink?
 No cabs to be had out there
 I wish I knew how
 Your eyes are like starlight now
 To break the spell
 I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
 
 I ought to say no, no, no, Sir
 Mind if I move in closer
 At least I'm gonna say that I tried
 What's the sense of hurting my pride?
 I really can't stay
 Oh, baby don't hold out, baby
 Ahh, but it's cold outside
 
 I simply must go
 But, baby, it's cold outside
 The answer is no
 But, baby, it's cold outside
 The welcome has been
 How lucky that you dropped in
 So nice and warm
 Look out the window at that storm
 
 My sister will be suspicious
 Gosh, your lips look delicious
 My brother will be there at the door
 Waves upon a tropical shore
 My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
 Gosh, your lips are delicious
 Well, maybe just a cigarette more
 Never such a blizzard before
 
 I've got to get home
 But, baby, you'll freeze out there
 Say, lend me a comb
 It's up to your knees out there
 You've really been grand
 I thrill when you touch my hand
 But don't you see
 How can you do this thing to me?
 
 There's bound to be talk tomorrow
 Think of my life long sorrow
 At least there will plenty implied
 If you caught pneumonia and died
 I really can't stay
 Get over that old out, baby
 Ahh, but it's cold outside
 
 Where could you be going
 When the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?
 Baby, it's cold, cold outside
 
 Life has a crazy pattern
 And fortune comes to few
 I'd like to take the pattern
 And fashion it for you
 
 Though there may be lean while
 Darling, in the meanwhile
 
 I'll give you my love
 I'm sure that love will see us through
 Baby, baby, what else can I do?
 If you want the moon
 I'll bring the moon right down to you
 Baby, baby, what else can I do?
 
 Someday we'll live in a mansion
 Out where the pastures are green
 But even in a small room
 Just a little hall room
 You'll be the king
 I'll be the queen
 
 So, please, take my heart
 Just for a start till dreams come true
 Baby, baby, what else can I do?

 Just for a start till dreams comes true
 Baby, baby, what else can I do?
 Baby, baby, what else can I do?
 
 Oh baby, won't you, please, come home
 'Cause your mama's all alone
 I have tried in vain
 Never no more to call your name
 
 When you left you broke my heart
 Because I never thought we'd part
 Every hour in the day you will hear me say
 Baby, won't you, please, come home?
 
 When you left you broke my heart
 Because I never thought we'd part
 Every hour in the day you will hear me say
 Oh baby, my baby
 Baby, won't you, please, come home?
 'Cause your mama needs some lovin'
 Baby, won't you, please, come on home?
 
 We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
 Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
 But we all return as we live wo learn,
 That we left our happiness behind.
 
 When they sing you "Look for the Silver Lining,"
 It is silver dollars they're looking for.
 You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
 Is somewhere around your kitchen door.
 
 The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
 Back in your own back yard,
 You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
 Back in your own back yard.
 Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
 But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
 You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
 Back in your own backyard.
 
 Won't you come along with me
 To the Mississippi
 We'll take the boat to the land of dreams
 Steam down the river down to New Orleans
 
 The band's there to meet us
 And old friends to greet us
 Where all the people always meet
 Heaven on earth they call it Basin Street
 
 Basin Street is the street
 Where the elite always meet
 In New Orleans the land of dreams
 You'll never know how nice it seems 
 Or just how much it really means
 
 Glad to be oh yessiree
 Where welcome's free are dear to me
 Where I can lose
 My Basin Street blues
 
 Glad to be oh yessiree
 Where welcome's free are dear to me
 Where I can lose
 My Basin Street blues
 
 Ain't you glad you came with me
 Way down to the Mississippi
 We took the boat to the land of dreams
 Steam down the river to New Orleans
 
 In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
 There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
 He can play piano any way that you like it
 But the way he likes to play is eight to the bar
 When he plays, it's a ball
 He's the daddy of them all
 
 The people gather around when he gets on the stand
 Then when he plays, he gets a hand
 The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance
 Nobody there bothers to dance
 But when he plays with the bass and guitar
 They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
 
 A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank
 A-plunkin' on the keys
 A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
 A-riffin' out with ease
 And when he plays with the bass and guitar
 They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
 
 He plays a boogie, he plays eight to the bar
 A boogie-woogie, that is the way he likes to play on his piano
 And we all know
 That when he plays he puts them all in a trance
 The cats all holler "Hooray"
 You'll hear them say, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
 
 In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
 There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
 When he plays with the bass and guitar
 They holler, "Beat me up Daddy, beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
 
 The people gather around when he gets up on the stand
 Then when he plays, he gets a hand
 The rhythm that he plays puts the cats in a trance
 Nobody there ever bothers to dance
 But when he plays with the bass and guitar
 They holler out, "Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar"
 
 A-plink plink, a-plank plank, a-plink plank, plink plank

 Because of rain, I fell in love with you
 The raindrops seem to want to help me too
 Because of rain, we stayed indoors and watched it pour
 That's how I found the one that I adore
 
 Because of rain, we stole a kiss or two
 The cloudy day gave way to skies of blue
 We must thank the misty, moisty windowpane
 We found our love because of rain
 
 Because of rain, we stole a kiss or two
 The cloudy day gave way to skies of blue
 We must thank the misty, moisty windowpane
 We found our love because of rain
 
 When they begin the beguine
 It brings back the sound of music so tender
 It brings back a night of tropical splendor
 It brings back a memory ever green
 
 I`m with you once more, under the stars
 And down by the shore, an orchestra`s playing
 And even the palms seem to be swaying
 When they begin the beguine
 
 To live it again is past all endeavor
 Except when that tune clutches my heart
 And there we are, swearing to love forever
 And promising never, never to part
 
 What moments divine, what rapture serene
 'Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
 And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
 I know but too well what they mean
 
 So don`t let them begin the beguine
 Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
 Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
 When they begin the beguine
 
 Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
 'Till the stars that were there before return above you
 'Till you whisper to me once more, darling, I love you
 
 And we suddenly know What heaven we`re in
 When they begin the beguine
 When they begin the beguine
 
 Of all the boys I've known, and I've known some
 Until I first met you, I was lonesome
 And when you came in sight, dear, my heart grew light
 And this old world seemed new to me
 
 You're really swell; I have to admit you
 Deserve expressions that really fit you
 And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
 All the things that you do to me
 
 Bei mir bist du schon; please, let me explain
 Bei mir bist du schon means you're grand
 Bei mir bist du schon; again, I'll explain
 It means you're the fairest in the land
 
 I could say bella, bella, even say voonderbar
 Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
 
 I've tried to explain, bei mir bist du schon
 So kiss me and say you understand
 
 Bei mir bist du schon; you've heard it all before
 But let me try to explain
 Bei mir bist du schon means that you're grand
 Bei mir bist du schon; it's such an old refrain
 And yet I should explain
 It means I am begging for your hand
 
 I could say bella, bella, even say voonderbar
 Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
 
 I could say bella, bella, even say voonderbar
 Each language only helps me tell you how grand you are
 
 I've tried to explain bei mir bist du schon
 So kiss me and say that you will understand
 
 Make with the roast beef
 Make with the gravy
 Make with the shortcake
 'Cause Benny's comin' home on Saturday
 
 Make with the clean sheets
 Make with the soft bed
 Make with the hot bath
 'Cause Benny's comin' home on Saturday
 
 Omit the beans, cancel the hash
 'Cause Benny had a-plenty of that
 Delete the Spam, evade the stew
 Benny may be skinny, but he's gonna be fat
 
 Call up the girlfriends
 Make with the party
 Spread with the good news
 'Cause Benny's comin' home on Saturday
 
 Omit the beans, cancel the hash
 'Cause Benny had a-plenty of that
 Delete the Spam, evade the stew
 Benny may be skinny, but he's gonna be fat

 Bess, you is my woman now
 You is, you is

 For two instead of one
 Want no wrinkle on yo' brow

 Because the sorrow of the past is all done, done
 Oh, Bess, my Bess
 
 Porgy, I's yo' woman now

 And I ain't never goin' nowhere 'less you shares the fun
 There's no wrinkle on my brow

 Porgy, I's yo' woman now
 I's yours forever
 Mornin' time and evenin' time and
 Summer time and winter time
 
 Mornin' time and evenin' time and
 Summer time and winter time

 Oh, my Porgy, my man, Porgy

 From this minute I'm tellin' you, I keep this vow

 I betcha, a nickel,
 I bet you I win.
 I betcha, a nickel
 That you will give in.
 
 What's a matter honey?
 'Fraid you'll lose?
 Do what you wanna,
 And say what you choose.
 
 I still betcha, a nickel,
 That you will be mine.
 I betcha, a nickel,
 Even raise it a dime.
 
 I always win my money;
 You can bet on that.
 I always take a tip,
 And keep it under my hat.
 
 You've got yourself, to yourself.
 Come on, get off that shelf.
 You can fool some of the people, some of the time,
 But you can't fool all the people, all of the time.
 
 That's why I betcha, a nickel,
 That you will be mine.
 I betcha, you'll sign on, the dotted line.
 I don't see no sense in wasting all this time,
 'Cause whatever you bet, your bet is gonna be mine.
 
 You've got yourself, to yourself.
 Come on, get off that shelf.
 You can fool some of the people, some of the time,
 But you can't fool all the people, all of the time.
 
 Say that ain't no money, you're wastin' my time.
 I don't see no sense in all this rhythm, and rhyme.
 'Cause whatever you bet, your bet is gonna be mine.
 
 I don't want you
 But I hate to lose you
 You've got me in between
 The devil and the deep blue sea
 
 I forgive you
 'Cause I can't forget you
 You've got me in between
 The devil and the deep blue sea
 
 I ought to cross you off my list
 But when you come a-knocking at my door
 Fate seems to give my heart a twist
 And I come running back for more
 
 I should hate you
 But I guess I love you
 You've got me in between
 The devil and the deep blue sea
 
 I ought to cross you off my list
 But when you come a-knocking at my door
 Fate seems to give my heart a twist
 And I come running back for more
 
 I should hate you
 But I guess I love you
 You've got me in between
 The devil and the deep blue sea
 
 After one whole quart of brandy
 Like a daisy, I'm awake
 With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
 I don't even shake
 
 Men are not a new sensation
 I've done pretty well I think
 But this half-pint imitation
 Put me on the blink
 
 I'm wild again, beguiled again
 A simpering, whimpering child again
 Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
 
 Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
 When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
 Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
 
 Lost my heart, but what of it
 He is cold I agree
 He can laugh, but I love it
 Although the laugh's on me
 
 I'll sing to him, each spring to him
 And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
 Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
 
 He's a fool and don't I know it
 But a fool can have his charms
 I'm in love and don't I show it
 Like a babe in arms
 
 Love's the same old sad sensation
 Lately I've not slept a wink
 Since this half-pint imitation
 Put me on the blink
 
 I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
 But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
 Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
 
 I'll sing to him, each spring to him
 And worship the trousers that cling to him
 Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
 
 When he talks, he is seeking
 Words to get off his chest
 Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best
 
 Vexed again, perplexed again
 Thank God, I can be oversexed again
 Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
 
 Wise at last, my eyes at last, 
 Are cutting you down to your size at last
 Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more
 
 Burned a lot, but learned a lot
 And now
 
 But I'm Bidin' My Time;
 'Cause that's the kinda guy I'm
 While other folks grow dizzy
 I keep busy
 
 Bidin' My Time.
 Next year, next year,
 Somethin's bound to happen;
 This year, this year,
 
 I'll just keep on nappin'
 And Bidin' My Time
 'Cause that's the kinda guy I'm.
 There's no regrettin'
 
 When I'm settin'
 Bidin' My Time.
 
 Big Boy Blue come blow your horn,
 Big Boy Blue it's almost dawn,
 And the band will soon be gone,

 Swing me high and swing me low,
 Rock me to and rock me fro
 Come on Blue, blow your horn!
 
 Now she wants, a butter an egg man
 From way out in the west
 She wants somebody, who's workin' all day
 So she's got money, when she wants to play
 
 Now pretty clothes, they'll never be mine
 But what she told me the other day
 I hope she don't change her mind
 Now she wants, a butter an egg man
 A great big butter and egg man
 From way down south
 
 Thank you, you're very kind
 Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?
 Won't you come home?
 Ah, you've been away too long
 I do that cooking, honey
 You just bring home the money
 Bill Bailey, please, come on home
 Each night, when we sing this
 We're making an attempt to swing this
 We sing this song a different way
 That's why I say
 Who knows, like Mack the Knife
 You may play this song all your life
 So, Bill Bailey, won't you come on home?
 
 As Miss Sophie Tucker might say
 Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?
 I say, won't you come home?
 Oh, you've been away
 Oh honey, you've been away too long
 I'll do that cooking, honey, yes
 You just bring home the money
 Some of these days, Bill
 You're gonna come on home
 
 As Miss Della Reese might say
 Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?
 I say, won't you come home?
 I say, you've been away too long
 
 And as Miss Pearl Bailey might say
 Bill, honey, daddy, you'd better bring it on home
 'Cause, honey, I'm just so tired of waiting on you
 Honey, these shoes--I, I'm telling you, baby, it can't wait no longer
 
 Yes, I said
 Won't you come, won't you come?
 Won't you come on home, Bill Bailey?
 I say, you've been away too long
 Since you've been gone, there's no stopping
 To this thing they call bee-bopping
 So, Bailey, please, come on home
 
 Now, everybody, twist it
 I say, everybody, twist it
 So, Bailey, please, come home, no more to roam
 
 I've sung the lyrics to this song so long
 I guess it's time to say so long
 So, Bailey, won't you come on home?
 Mama needs loving
 Bill, Bailey, won't you come?
 Come home
 
 Thank you, you're very kind
 Won't you come home, Bill Bailey?
 Won't you come home?
 Ah, you've been away too long

 You just bring home the money
 Bill Bailey, please, come on home

 Come home
 
 Oh, lullaby of birdland
 That's what I always hear,
 When you sigh,
 Never in my wordland could there be words to reveal
 in a phrase how I feel
 
 Have you ever heard two turtle doves
 Bill and coo, when they love?
 That's the kind of magic music we get from our lips
 When we kiss
 
 And there's a weepy old willow
 He really knows how to cry,
 That's how I'd cry in my pillow
 If you grew tired and just said goodbye
 
 Lullaby of birdland whisper low
 Kiss me sweet, then we'll go
 Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
 All because were in love
 
 So sing me to sleep
 Rock me to sleep
 Birdland 
 
 I'm feeling mighty lonesome
 Haven't slept a wink
 I walk the floor and watch the door
 And in between I drink
 Black coffee
 Love's a hand me down brew
 I'll never know a Sunday
 In this weekday room
 
 I'm talking to the shadows
 From 1 o'clock til 4
 And lord, how slow the moments go
 When all I do is pour
 Black coffee
 Since the blues caught my eye
 I'm hanging out on Monday
 My Sunday dreams to dry
 
 Now a man is born to go a lovin'
 A woman's born to weep and fret
 To stay at home and tend her oven
 And drown her past regrets
 In coffee and cigarettes
 
 I'm moaning all the morning
 And mourning all the night
 And in between it's nicotine
 And not much heart to fight
 Black coffee
 Feelin' low as the ground
 It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby
 To maybe come around... around
 I'm waiting for my baby
 To maybe come around
 
 My nerves have gone to pieces
 My hair is turning gray
 All I do is drink black coffee
 Since my man's gone away
 
 While other lovers sing your praisesin phases deftly lyrical. 
 I'm a cat who's better at a scat songthat's satirical
 In begging for your hand, sweet chick I hope you'll understand this lick.
 My love to you I bring on account a you can sing 
 Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp
 My love for you in true on account a you can do 
 Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp
 My poor heart gives a start like a Jitter Bug just won't stop
 Mix your crooning with my spooning and let me blow my top.
 Your love to me I've sworn on account a mine is your'n
 Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp.
 My love to you I bring on account a you can sing 
 Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp
 My love for you in true on account a you can do 
 Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp
 My poor heart gives a start like a Jitter Bug just won't stop
 Mix your crooning with my spooning and let me blow my top.
 Your love to me I've sworn on account a mine is your'n
 Bli-Blip Varthy Flam flam flam Hipideedleada Baaaaaaaaaaimp.
 
 Its not the pale moon that excites me
 That thrills and delights me, oh no
 Its just the nearness of you
 
 It isn't your sweet conversation
 That brings this sensation, oh no
 Its just the nearness of you
 
 When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me
 All my wildest dreams come true
 
 I need no soft lights
 To enchant me
 If you'll only grant me the right
 To hold you ever so tight
 And to feel in the night the
 
 Blue moon you saw me standing alone
 Without a dream in my heart
 Without a love of my own
 
 Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
 You heard me saying a prayer for 
 Someone I really could care for
 
 And then there suddenly appeared before me
 The only one my arms will ever hold
 I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"
 And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold
 
 Blue moon now I'm no longer alone
 Without a dream in my heart
 Without a love of my own
 
 And then there suddenly appeared before me
 The only one my arms will ever hold
 I heard somebody whisper "Please adore me"
 And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold
 
 Blue moon now I'm no longer alone
 Without a dream in my heart
 Without a love of my own
 
 Blue skies
 Smiling at me
 Nothing but blue skies
 Do I see
 
 Bluebirds
 Singing a song
 Nothing but bluebirds
 All day long
 
 Never saw the sun shining so bright
 Never saw things going so right
 Noticing the days hurrying by
 When you're in love, my how they fly
 
 Blue days
 All of them gone
 Nothing but blue skies
 From now on
 
 I never saw the sun shining so bright
 Never saw things going oh-so right
 Noticing the days hurrying by
 When you're in love, my how they fly
 
 Blue days
 All of them gone
 Nothing but blue skies
 From now on
 
 My mama done tol' me, when I was in knee-pants
 My mama done tol' me, " Son a woman'll sweet talk"
 And give ya the big eye, but when the sweet talkin's done
 
 A woman's a two-face, A worrisome thing 
 Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night
 Now the rain's a-fallin', hear the train's a-callin,
 "Whooee!"
  Hear dat lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle, "Whooee!"
  A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's a-echoin' back th' blues in the night
 
 The evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin' and the moon'll hide its light 
 When you get the blues in the night
 Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song, 
 He knows things are wrong and he's right
 
 From Natchez to Mobile, from Memphis to St. Joe, wherever the four winds blow
 I been in some big towns an' heard me some big talk, but there is one thing I know
 
 A woman's a two-face, a worrisome thing 
 Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night
 My mama was right, there's blues in
 
 My heart is sad and lonely
 For you I pine, for you dear only
 Why haven`t you seen it?
 I`m all for you, body and soul
 
 I spend my days in longing
 And wondering why it`s me you`re wronging
 I tell you I mean it
 I`m all for you, body and soul
 
 I can`t believe it, it`s hard to conceive it
 That you`d turn away romance.
 Are you pretending? It looks like the ending 
 Unless I can have
 Just one more chance, dear
 
 My life a wreck you`re making
 My heart is yours for just the taking
 I`ll gladly surrender
 Myself to you, body and soul
 
 What can I say to you, Bonita, what magic word would capture you
 Like a soft salacious mist you are, Bonita, you fly away when love is new
 What do you ask of me, Bonita, what part do you want me to play,
 Shall I be the clown for you, Bonita, I will be anything you say.
 Bonita, don't run away, Bonita.
 
 Bonita, don't be afraid to fall in love with me,
 I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you, Bonita.
 If you love me, life would be beautiful, Bonita.
 I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you.
 If you love me, life would be beautiful, Bonita.
 
 Born to lose, I lived my life in vain
 Every dream has only brought me pain
 All my life I've always been so blue
 Born to lose and now I'm losing you
 Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
 How I long to always have you there
 You've grown tired and now you say we're through
 Born to lose and now I'm losing you
 Born to lose and now I'm losing you
 
 I've just finished writing an advertisement
 Calling for a boy.
 No half-hearted Romeo or flirt is meant;
 That`s the kind I`d not employ.
 Though anybody interested can apply,
 He must know a thing or two to qualify.
 For instance:
 
 He must be able to dance.
 He must make life a romance.
 I said a boy wanted,
 One who can smile;
 Boy wanted, lovable style.
 
 He must know how to say "Yes!"
 When I look at a new dress.
 Oh, I`ll be ready when the right one calls,
 And I`ll start vamping him until he falls;
 Yes, if he proves to be the right little laddie,
 I`ll make him glad he answered my ad.
 
 He must like musical shows,
 And he must wear snappy clothes.
 Yes, that is my story,
 And to it I`ll stick;
 No glory
 In having a hick.
 
 He needn't be such a saint,
 But, Oh! he doesn't say "ain`t."
 I don`t care if his bankroll totals naught,
 For we can live on love and food for thought.
 If he`s a scholar, when I see him I`ll holler,
 My lad, I`m glad you answered my ad!`

 Primrose Version:
 Verse:
 I`ve just finished writing an advertisement
 Calling for a boy.
 No half-hearted Romeo or flirt is meant;
 That`s the kind I won`t employ.
 Though anybody interested can apply,
 He must know a thing to qualify.
 For instance:
 
 Refrain 1:
 To have a ghost of a chance,
 He must be able to dance.
 The sort of boy wanted
 Must have a smile
 Boy wanted,
 Lovable style.
 He must be tender and true,
 And if he knows what to do,
 I think I`ll learn to love him very soon;
 I`ll want him morning, night and afternoon.
 So if you know of one who`s wanting employment,
 Just tell him that
 I`m wanting a boy!
 
 Refrain 2:
 To be the boy of my choice,
 He`s got to own a Rolls Royce.
 He must be quite reckless
 Buying me things:
 Pearl necklace,
 Diamond rings.
 He must be ready to pay
 A dozen bills ev`ry day.
 I`ll simply smothing him with tender care
 If I could find a multimillionaire.
 So if you could seen one dining at the Savoy-oh!
 Just tell him
 I`m wanting a boy!
 
 Refrain 3:
 I won`t have anyone small,
 He must be handsome and tall.
 I said a boy wanted,
 Beautifully dressed;
 Boy wanted,
 Trousers well pressed.
 He must have wonderful eyes;
 He must wear wonderful ties.
 I want a boy who`ll always look as though
 He`s only just come out of Savile Row.
 So if some Paris wants a Helen of Troy-oh!
 Just tell him that
 I`m wanting a boy.
 
 I fetch his slippers, fill up the pipe he smokes
 I cook the kippers, laugh at his oldest jokes
 Yet here I anchor, I might have had a banker
 Boy! what love has done to me
 His nature's funny, quarrelsome half the time
 And as for money, he hasn't got a dime
 And here's the joker, I might have had a broker
 Boy! what love has done to me
 When a guy looks my way
 Does he get emphatic, say he gets dramatic?
 I just want to fly 'way
 But if I left him I'd be all at sea
 I'm just a slavey, life is a funny thing
 He's got the gravy, I got a wedding ring
 And still I love him, there's nobody above him
 Boy! what love has done to me
 His brains are minus,
 Never a thought in sight
 
 And yet his highness
 Lectures me day and night;
 Oh where was my sense
 To sign that wedding license?
 Boy! What love has done to me!
 My life he's wrecking, bet you could find him now
 Out somewhere necking somebody else's frau
 You get to know life when married to a low life
 Boy! what love has done to me
 I can't hold my head up
 The butcher, the baker, oh no he's a faker
 Brother I am fed up
 But if I left him he'd be up a tree
 Where will it wind up, I don't know where I'm at
 I make my mind up, I oughta leave him flat
 But I have grown so, I love that dirty so-and-so
 Boy! what love has done to me.
 
 Do not wait until some deed of greatness you may do
 Do not wait to shed your light afar
 To the many duties ever near you now be true
 Brighten the corner where you are
 
 Brighten the corner where you are
 Brighten the corner where you are
 Someone far from harbor you may guide across the bar
 Brighten the corner where you are
 
 Just above are clouded skies that you may help to clear
 Let not narrow self your way debar
 Though into one heart alone may fall your song of cheer
 Brighten the corner where you are
 
 Here for all your talent you may surely find a need
 Here reflect the bright and Morning Star
 Even from your humble hand the Bread of Life may feed
 Brighten the corner where you are
 
 
 You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
 You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
 Thin or fat, young or old;
 Shake their shoulders bold.
 You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
 You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
 Hold me baby; Let's syncopate to that blue melody;
 Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!
 While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.
 
 They're writing songs of love, but not for me
 A lucky star's above, but not for me
 With love to lead the way
 I've found more clouds of gray
 Than any Russian play could guarantee
 
 I was a fool to fall and get that way
 Hi ho, alas, and also lackaday
 Although I can't dismiss
 The memory of his kiss
 I guess he's not for me
 
 I was a fool to fall and get that way
 Hi ho, alas, and also lackaday
 Although I can't dismiss
 The memory of his kiss
 I guess he's not for me
 
 I'm so unhappy
 What'll I do?
 I long for somebody who
 Will sympathize with me
 I'm growing so tired of living alone
 I lie awake all night and cry
 Nobody loves me
 That's why
 
 All by myself in the morning
 All by myself in the night
 I sit alone with a table and a chair
 So unhappy there
 Playing solitaire
 
 All by myself I get lonely
 Watching the clock on the shelf
 I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
 I hate to grow older
 All by myself
 
 Away with the music of Broadway
 Be off with your Irving Berlin
 Oh I give no quarter to Kern or Cole Porter
 And Gershwin keeps pounding on tin
 
 How can I be civil when hearing this drivel
 It`s only for nightclubbin` souses
 Oh give me the free `n` easy waltz that is Vienneasy and
 Go tell the band If they want a hand
 The waltz must be Strauss`s
 
 Ya, ya ya, give me oom-pa-pah
 When I want a melody
 Lilting through the house
 Then I want a melody
 By Strauss
 It laughs, it sings, the world is in rhyme
 Swinging to three-quarter time
 
 Let the Danube flow along
 And the Fledermauss
 Keep the wine and give me song
 By Strauss
 
 By Jove, by Jing, by Strauss is the thing
 So I say to ha-cha-cha, heraus!
 Just give me your oom-pa-pah, by Strauss!
 
 Let the Danube flow along
 And the Fledermauss
 Keep the wine and give me song
 By Strauss
 
 By Jove, by Jing, by Strauss is the thing
 So I say to ha-cha-cha, heraus!
 Just give me your oom-pa-pah,
 
 Baby, take me down to Duke's place
 Wildest box in town is Duke's place
 Love that piano sound in Duke's place
 Saxes do their tricks in Duke's place
 
 Fellas swing their chicks in Duke's place
 Come on, get your kicks in Duke's place
 You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat
 You look around and yell waiter
 
 You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up
 You're jetting along with your girlie
 It's after three o'clock, but, baby, it's still early
 If you've never been to Duke's place
 Take your tootsies into Duke's place
 Life is in a spin in Duke's place
 
 When love comes in and take you for a spin
 Oo la la la, c'est magnifique
 When every night your loved one holds you tight
 Oo la la la, c'est magnifique
 But when, one day, your loved one drifts away
 Oo la la la, it's so tragique
 But when, once more, she whispers, "Je t'a dore"
 C'est magnifique
 
 Hmm, c'est si bon 
 Lovers say that in France 
 When they thrill to romance 
 It means that it's so good 
 
 Oh, c'est si bon
 So I say it to you 
 Like the French people do 
 Because it's oh-so good, ba-ba-doo, doo day
 
 Every word, every sigh
 Every kiss, dear 
 Leads to only one thought 
 And it's this, dear!
 
 Hmm, it's so good
 Nothing else can replace 
 Just your slightest embrace 
 And if you only would
 Be my own
 For the rest of my days 
 I will whisper this phrase 
 My darling, c'est si bon, oui oui!
 
 Baby, take me down to Duke's place
 Wildest box in town is Duke's place
 Love that piano sound in Duke's place
 Saxes do their tricks in Duke's place
 
 Fellas swing their chicks in Duke's place
 Come on, get your kicks in Duke's place
 You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat
 You look around and yell waiter
 
 You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up
 You're jetting along with your girlie
 It's after three o'clock, but, baby, it's still early
 If you've never been to Duke's place
 Take your tootsies into Duke's place
 Life is in a spin in Duke's place
 
 In this cloudy sky overhead now
 There's no guiding star I can see
 And I would be lost by each wild tempest tossed
 Oh, if I didn't know of a place we two can go
 
 There's a little cabin in the sky, Mister
 For me and for you
 I feel that it's true somehow
 
 Can't you see that cabin in the sky, Mister
 An acre or two of heavenly blue to plow?
 
 We will be oh-so gay
 Eat fried chicken every day
 As the angels go sailing by
 
 And that is why my heart is flyin' high, Mister
 'Cause I know we'll have a cabin in the sky
 
 We will be oh-so gay
 Eat fried chicken every day
 As the angels go sailing by
 
 That is why my heart is flying high, baby
 'Cause I know we'll have a cabin in the sky
 
 Call me darlin', call me sweetheart, call me dear
 Thrill me, darlin', with words I want to hear
 In your dark eyes so smilin' a promise I see
 But your two lips won't say you care for me
 
 Oh my darlin', if my daydreams would come true
 You would meet me at a secret rendezvous
 And I'd find the paradise that lies deep in your eyes
 Call me darlin', call me sweetheart, call me dear
 
 Can anyone explain the thrill of a kiss?
 No! No! No!
 But when two eager lips are pressed against yours
 You'll know, yes, you'll know
 
 Can anyone explain the glow of romance?
 No! No! No!
 But when you hear the phrase "It's you I adore"
 You'll know, yes, you'll know
 
 And you will find, to give love a start
 Don't think with your mind; just feel with your heart
 
 Can anyone explain the wonder of love?
 No! No! No!
 But now that you and I are sharing a sigh
 We know, yes, we know
 
 And you will find, to give love a start
 Don't think with your mind; just feel with your heart
 
 Can anyone explain the wonder of love?
 No! No! No!
 But now that you and I are sharing a sigh
 We know, yes, we know
 
 
 Oh listen, sister,
 I love my mister man,
 And I can't tell yo' why,
 Dere ain't no reason
 Why I should love dat man.
 It must be sumpin' dat de angels done plan.
 
 Refrain:
 
 Fish got to swim, birds got to fly,
 I got to love one man till I die.
 Can't help lovin' dat man of mine.
 Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,
 Tell me I'm crazy .
 Can't help lovin' dat man of mine.
 When he goes away
 Dat's a rainy day,
 But when he comes back dat day is fine,
 De sun will shine!
 He kin come home as late as kin be,
 Home widout him ain't no home to me.
 Can't help lovin' dat man of mine.
 ~~~
 My man is shif'less
 An' good for nuthin' too
 
 He's never round here
 When dere is work to do.
 He's never round here when dere's workin' to do.
 De chimbley's smokin',
 De roof is leakin' in,
 But he don't seem to care.
 He kin be happy
 Wid jes' a sip of gin.
 Ah even love him when his kisses got gin!
 
 Repeat Refrain

 I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
 Now it seems, this is how the story ends
 He's going to turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends
 
 I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
 Not for long, I can see the way this ends
 He's going to turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends
 
 Never again, through with love
 Through with men
 They play their game without shame
 And who's to blame
 
 I thought I'd found a man I could trust
 What a bust, this is how the story ends
 He's going to turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends
 
 Yes, I thought I knew the wheat from the chaff
 What a laugh, this is how our story ends
 I'll let her turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends
 
 I acted like a kid out of school
 What a fool, now I see this is the end
 I'll let her turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends
 
 Oh what should I give
 Though he gave me the air
 Why should I cry
 He was sigh and wonder why
 
 Yes, I should have seen the signal to stop
 What a flop, this is how the story ends
 She's gonna turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends
 
 What should I give
 Though he gave me the air
 And why should I cry
 He was sigh and wonder why
 
 I should have seen the signal to stop
 What a flop, this is how the story ends
 I let him turn me down and say
 
 Can't we be, can't we be, can't we be
 Can't we be, can't we be, can't we be friends
 Oh yes
 
 Night and stars above that shine so bright 
 The mystery of their fading light 
 That shines upon our caravan 
 
 Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
 Across the sand so I may keep 
 The memory of our caravan 
 
 This is so exciting 
 You are so inviting 
 Resting in my arms 
 As I thrill to the magic charms 
 Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
 My dream of love is coming true 
 Within our desert caravan
 
 Love was the thing that you wanted
 That's why we answered loves call
 Now that you've got what you wanted
 You don't seem to want it at all
 
 Careless
 Now that you've got me loving you
 You're careless
 Careless in everything you do
 
 You break up appointments and think you are smart
 If you're not careful you'll break my heart
 
 Careless
 Now that my bridges all are burned
 You're careless
 Careless in things where I'm concerned
 Are you just careless, as you seem to be
 Or do you just care less for me?
 
 Cari'o de mis cari'os
 Tormento de mis tormentos
 Delirio de mis delirios
 Amor de mis pensamientos
 
 Ternura de mis ternuras
 Refugio de mis pesares
 Locura de mis locuras
 Y cantar de mis cantares
 
 Sangre que va por mis venas
 Y anida en mi coraz'n
 Eres due'o de mis penas
 Raz'n de m' sin raz'n
 
 Cari'o, cari'o, cari'o de mis cari'os
 
 Cari'o, cari'o, cari'o de mis cari'os
 
 Sol que calienta mi vida
 Luna que alumbra mi cielo
 Canci'n, caricia y herida
 Y causa de mis desvelos
 
 Cari'o de mis cari'os
 Causa de mis alegr'as
 Descanso de mis angustias
 Amor de todos mis d'as
 
 Sangre que va por mis venas
 Y anida en mi coraz'n
 Eres due'o de mis penas
 Raz'n de m' sin raz'n
 
 Cari'o, cari'o, cari'o de mis cari'os
 
 Must you dance every dance with the same fortunate man? 
 You have danced with him since the music began.
 Won't you change partners and dance with me? 
 Must you dance quite so close with your lips touching his face? 
 Can't you see
 I'm longing to be in his place? 
 Won't you change partners and dance with me? 
 
 Ask him to sit this one out.
 While you're alone,
 I'll tell the waiter to tell
 Him he's wanted on the telephone.
 
 You've been locked in his arms ever since heaven-knows-when.
 Won't you change partners and then,
 You may never want to change partners again.
 
 Heaven, I'm in heaven
 And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
 And I seem to find the happiness I seek
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
 
 Yes, heaven, I'm in heaven
 And the cares that hung around me through the week
 Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
 
 Oh I love to climb to mountain
 And reach the highest peak
 But it doesn't thrill me half as much
 As dancing cheek to cheek
 
 Oh I love to go out fishing
 In a river or a creek
 But I don't enjoy it half as much
 As dancing cheek to cheek
 
 Now mama dance with me
 I want my arms about you
 That charm about you
 Will carry me through
 
 Yes, heaven, I'm in heaven
 And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
 And I seem to find the happiness I seek
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
 Take it Ella swing it
 
 Heaven, I'm in heaven
 And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
 And I seem to find the happiness I seek
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
 
 Heaven, I'm in heaven
 And the cares that hung around me through the week
 Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
 
 Oh I love to climb a mountain
 And reach the highest peak
 But it doesn't thrill me half as much
 As dancing cheek to cheek
 
 Oh I love to go out fishing
 In a river or a creek
 But I don't enjoy it half as much
 As dancing cheek to cheek
 
 Come on and dance with me
 I want my arms about you
 That charm about you
 Will carry me through
 
 To heaven, I'm in heaven
 And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
 And I seem to find the happiness I seek
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
 
 Dance with me
 I want my arms about you
 That charm about you
 Will carry me through
 
 To heaven , I'm in heaven 
 And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
 And I seem to find the happiness I seek
 When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
 Cheek to cheek
 Cheek to cheek
 Cheek to cheek
 
 There`s a cheerful little earful
 Gosh I miss it something fearful
 And this cheerful little earful
 Is the well known "I love you."
 
 Stocks can go down, business slow down
 But the milk and honey flow down
 With a cheerful little earful
 Of the well known "I love you."
 
 In ev`ry play it`s a set phrase
 What the public get phrase
 But as a pet phrase it`ll do do do
 Poo-pa-roo-it
 Soft and see you-it
 Make me happy, you can do it.
 
 With a cheerful little earful
 Of the well known "I love you."
 
 I was a stranger in the city
 Out of town were the people I knew
 I had that feeling of self-pity
 What to do, what to do, what to do?
 The outlook was decidedly blue
 
 But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
 It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known
 
 A foggy day, in London town
 Had me low, had me down
 I viewed the morning with much alarm
 British museum had lost it's charm
 
 How long I wondered
 Could this thing last
 But the age of miracles hadn't past
 For, suddenly, I saw you there
 And through foggy London town
 The sun was shining everywhere
 
 For, suddenly, I saw you there
 And through foggy London town
 The sun was shining everywhere
 
 Everywhere
 Everywhere
 Everywhere
 
 Right here pretty baby sit here on your mommas knee

 Come on lead me pretty baby cause you know I can be led
 Squeeze me pretty baby yes until my face turns cherry red
 Right here pretty baby sit here onyour mommas knee
 Squeeze me pretty baby yes until my face turns cherry red

 And it's solid too

 Let's get away from sleigh bells
 Let's get away from snow 
 Let's make a break some Christmas, dear
 I know the place to go
 
 How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? 
 How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea? 
 How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? 
 How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree? 
 
 How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do? 
 Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
 If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island 
 You will never stray for everyday 
 Your Christmas dreams come true
 
 How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do? 
 Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe 
 If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island 
 You will never stray, for everyday 
 Your Christmas dreams come true 
 On Christmas Island your dreams come true
 
 Clap hands, here comes Charlie
 Clap hands, good time Charlie

 Hey, hey, Charlie, take a bow
 
 Ginger ale and white rock for his table
 Grab a chair, move over there
 And let him sit right next to Mabel
 
 Clap hands, here comes Charlie

 They can tell that he's a buyer
 From those wide and open spaces
 
 Clap hands, here comes Charlie

 He's a big man with the ladies
 And sail her with his doubt
 When he starts to wail and holler, "Go man go"
 
 Oh boy, there was Charlie
 What joy, swingin' Charlie
 Clap hands, there goes Charlie now
 
 Verse
 POTTER:
 Come on, you children, gather around -
 Gather around, you children.
 And we will lose that evil spirit
 Called the voodoo.
 Nothin' but trouble, if he has found,
 
 If he has found you, children -
 But you can chase the hoodoo
 With the dance that you do.
 Let me lead the way.
 Jubilee today!
 He'll never hound you;
 Stamp on the ground, you children!
 Come on!
 
 Refrain
 Clap-a yo' hand! Slap-a yo' thigh!
 Halleluyah! Halleluyah!
 Ev'rybody come along and join the Jubilee!
 Clap-a yo' hand! Slap-a yo' thigh!
 Don t you lose time! Don't you lose time!
 Come along-it's shake yo' shoes time
 Now for you and me!
 On the sands of time
 You are only a pebble;
 Remember, trouble must be treated
 Just like a rebel;
 Send him to the Debble!
 Clap-a yo' hand! Slap-a yo' thigh!
 Halleluyah! Halleluyah!
 Everybody come along and join the Jubilee!
 
 Why do birds suddenly appear
 Every time you are near?
 Just like me, they long to be
 Close to you
 
 Why do stars fall down from the sky
 Every time you walk by?
 Just like me, they long to be
 Close to you
 
 On the day that you were born, the angels got together
 And decided to create a dream come true
 So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
 And starlight in your eyes of blue
 
 That is why all the girls in town
 Follow you all around
 Just like me, they long to be
 Close to you
 
 On the day that you were born, the angels got together
 And decided to create a dream come true
 So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
 And starlight in your eyes of blue
 
 That is why all the girls in town
 Follow you all around
 Just like me, they long to be
 Close to you
 
 Just like me they long to be
 Close to you
 I've only just began to live close to you
 
 Music, play 
 Something dreamy for dancing 
 While we're here romancing 
 It's love's holiday 
 And love will be our guide 
 
 Close your eyes 
 When you open them, dear 
 I'll be right here by your side 
 So
 
 Close your eyes 
 Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep 
 Close your eyes 
 And I will close mine 
 
 Close your eyes 
 Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep 
 Close your eyes 
 This is divine 
 
 Music, play 
 Something dreamy for dancing 
 While were here romancing 
 It's love's holiday 
 And love will be our guide
 
 Close your eyes 
 When you open them, dear 
 I'll be near by your side 
 So won't you close your eyes?
 
 
 I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you
 Come rain or come shine
 High as a mountain, deep as a river
 Come rain or come shine
 I guess when you met me
 It was just one of those things
 
 But don't you ever bet me
 'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me
 You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me
 Come rain or come shine
 
 We'll be happy together, unhappy together
 Now won't that be just fine
 The days may be cloudy or sunny
 We're in or out of the money
 But I'm with you always
 I'm with you rain or shine
 
 Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet
 Comes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat
 Comes love, nothing can be done
 
 Comes a fire, then you know just what to do
 Blow a tire, you can buy another shoe
 Comes love, nothing can be done
 
 Don't try hiding, cause there isn't any use
 You'll start sliding, when your heart turns on the juice
 
 Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
 Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away
 Comes love, nothing can be done
 
 Comes a heatwave, you can hurry to the shore
 Comes a summons, you can hide behind the door
 Comes love, nothing can be done
 
 Comes the measles, you can quarantine a room
 Comes a mousy, you can chase it with a broom
 Comes love, nothing can be done
 
 That's all, brother, if you ever been in love
 That's all, brother, you know what I'm speaking of
 
 Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake
 Comes depression, you may get another break
 Comes love, nothing can be done
 Comes love, nothing can be done
 Comes love, nothing can be done
 
 Comes love
 Comes love
 Comes love
 Comes love
 
 Si vieras como me duele
 Que no tomaras en serio
 Mis sentimientos si vieras
 Como estoy sabiendo que
 No te tengo
 
 Si vieras como me duele
 Que no tomaras en serio
 Mis sentimientos si vieras
 Como estoy sabiendo que
 No te tengo
 
 Quisiera que te metieras
 Un poquilito aqu' en mi
 Pensamiento para que vieras
 A este amor, como
 Desgarra por dentro
 
 Si vieras como me duele, ay!
 Sentir tu fuego de amor
 Que tan solo represente yo
 Un pasatiempo mejor
 Si vieras como me duele
 Como consumes mi ser
 Tambi'n presiento
 Que te voy a perder
 Pero soy necia en querer
 Si vieras como me duele
 Como me duele tu amor
 Si vieras como me duele, ay!
 Si vieras como me duele
 
 
 Come on, wail
 Wail, Cotton Tail
 Benny Webster, come on and blow for me
 
 That's Cotton Tail
 
 Come on, wail
 Wail, Cotton Tail
 Benny Webster, come on and blow for me
 
 That's Cotton Tail
 
 Out on the plains down near Santa Fe
 I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day
 And as he jogged along I heard him singin'
 The most peculiar cowboy song
 It was a ditty, he learned in the city
 Comma ti yi yi yeah
 Comma ti yippity yi yeah
 
 Now get along, get hip little doggies
 Get along, better be on your way
 Get along, get hip little doggies
 He trucked 'em on down that old fairway
 Singin' his Cow Cow Boogie in the strangest way
 Comma ti yi yi yeah
 Comma ti yippity yi yeah
 
 Now singin' his cowboy songs
 He's just too much
 He's got a knocked out western accent with a dixie 
 Touch
 He was raised on local ways
 He's what you call a swingin' half breed
 Singin' his Cow Cow Booogie in the strangest way
 Comma ti yi yi yeah
 Comma ti yippity yi yeah
 
 CRAB MAN
 I'm talkin' about devil crabs
 1'm talkin' about devil crabs
 I'm talkin' about de food I sells
 
 She crab, she crab.
 
 PORGY
 On yo' way, brother.
 
 CRAB MAN
 Devil crab!
 
 MARIA
 Hey, crab man!
 
 CRAB MAN
 I'm talkin' about de food I sells
 When I done talkin' about de food I sells
 Talkin' about devil crab.
 (Maria picks crab, counts out money, pays Crab mon,
 who then leaves.)
 Now I's talkin' about yo' pocketbook
 I'm talkin' about devil crabs, she crab, she crab,
 Devil crab, I'm talkin' about de food I sells.
 
 Crazy rhythm, here's the doorway
 I'll go my way, you'll go your way
 Crazy rhythm, from now on we're through
 
 Here is where we have a showdown
 I'm too high and you're too low down
 Crazy rhythm, here's goodbye to you
 
 They say that when a high brow meets a low brow
 Walking along Broadway
 Soon the high brow he has no brow
 Ain't it a shame and you're to blame?
 
 What's the use of our mission?
 You produce the same condition
 Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too
 
 They say that when a high brow meets a low brow
 Walking along Broadway
 Soon the high brow he has no brow
 Ain't it a shame and you're to blame?
 
 What's the use of prohibition?
 You produce the same condition
 Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too
 Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too
 Crazy rhythm, I've gone crazy too
 
 Now you say you're lonely 
 You cry the long night through
 Well, you can cry me a river
 Cry me a river
 I cried a river over you
 Now you say you're sorry
 For being so untrue
 Well, you can cry me a river
 Cry me a river
 'Cause I cried, I cried, I cried a river over you
 You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
 While you never shed a tear
 Remember, I remember, all that you said?
 You told me love was too plebeian
 Told me you were through with me and
 
 And now you say, you say you love me
 Well, just to prove you do
 Come on and cry me a river
 Cry me a river
 'Cause I cried a river over you
 
 You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
 While you never shed a tear
 Remember, I remember, all that you said?
 Told me love was too plebeian
 Told me you were through with me and
 
 Now, now you say you love me
 Well, just to prove you do
 Come on and cry, cry, cry me a river
 Cry me a river
 'Cause I cried a river over you
 
 If my pillow could talk, imagine what it would have said
 Could it be a river of tears I cried instead?
 So you can cry me a river
 Daddy, go ahead and cry me a river
 'Cause I cried, how I cried a river over you
 How I cried a river over you
 
 I don't know why
 We're saying goodbye
 But you say it's best we should part
 I'm gonna hurrying you out of my mind
 And cry you out of my heart
 
 I thought that you would always be true
 But I was mistaken it seems
 I'm gonna worrying you out of my mind
 And cry you out of my dreams
 
 I try to pretend this isn't the end
 But that's not so easy I find
 I should gay and call it day
 But you know me the sentimental kind
 
 Somebody new means heaven to you
 You're leaving to make a new start
 I'm gonna hurrying you out of my mind
 And cry you out of my heart
 
 I try to pretend this isn't the end
 But that's not so easy I find
 I should gay and call it day
 But you know me the sentimental kind
 
 Somebody new means heaven to you
 You're leaving to make a new start
 I'm gonna hurrying you out of my mind
 And cry you out of my heart
 
 Woe is me
 I'm as blue as anyone can be
 I feel like a weepin' willow tree
 I'm in a cryin' mood
 
 Pair by pair
 I see happy lovers everywhere
 But the one I love don't seem to care
 I'm in a cryin' mood
 
 Each day I'm by my own-some
 Blue Mondays rain or shine
 I'll say this world is lonesome
 I'm just the lonesome kind
 
 Why, oh, why
 Did he have to go and say goodbye?
 Seems the moon is low and so am I
 I'm in a cryin' mood
 
 Each day I'm by my own-some
 Blue Mondays rain or shine
 I'll say this world is lonesome
 I'm just the lonesome kind
 
 Oh, why, oh, why
 Did he have to go and say goodbye?
 Seems the moon is low and so am I
 I'm in a cryin' mood
 
 You saw me crying in the chapel
 The tears I shed were tears of joy
 I know the meaning of contentment
 I am happy with the Lord
 
 Just a plain and simple chapel
 Where all good people go to pray
 I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger
 As I live from day to day
 
 I searched and I searched but I couldn't find
 No way on earth to find peace of mind
 
 Now I'm happy in the chapel
 Where people are of one accord
 Yes, we gather in the chapel
 Just to sing and praise the Lord
 
 You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find
 No way on earth to find peace of mind
 
 Take your troubles to the chapel
 Get down on your knees and pray
 Then your burdens will be lighter
 And you'll surely find a way
 
 
 
 Dancing in the dark till the tune ends
 We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends
 We're waltzing in the wonder of why we're here
 Time hurries by--we're here and gone
 
 Looking for the light of a new love
 To brighten up the night, I have you, love
 And we can face the music together
 Dancing in the dark
 
 The world is lyrical
 Because a miracle
 Has brought my lover to me
 Though she's some other place, her face I see
 
 At night I creep in bed
 And never sleep in bed
 But look above in the air
 And to my greatest joy, my love is there
 
 She dances overhead
 On the ceiling near my bed
 In my sight
 All through the night
 
 I try to hide in vain
 Underneath my counterpane
 But there's my love
 Up there above
 
 I whisper, "Go away, my lover
 It's not fair"
 But I'm so grateful to discover
 That she's still there
 
 I love my ceiling more
 Since it is a dancing floor
 Just for my love
 
 Darn that dream I dream each night
 You say you love me and hold me tight
 But when I awake and you're out of sight
 Oh, darn that dream
 
 Darn your lips and darn your eyes
 They lift me high above the moonlit sky
 Then I tumble out of paradise
 Oh, darn that dream
 
 Darn that one-track mind of mine
 I can't understand that you don't care
 Just to change the mood I'm in
 I'd welcome a nice old nightmare
 
 Darn that dream and bless it too
 Without that dream I never have you
 But it haunts me and it won't come true
 Oh, darn that dream
 
 Day by day
 Day by day
 Oh dear Lord
 Three things I pray
 To see thee more clearly
 Love thee more dearly
 Follow thee more nearly
 Day by day
 
 Oh
 Day by day
 Day by day
 Oh dear Lord

 To see thee more clearly
 Love thee more dearly
 Follow thee more nearly

 Funny the way I feel now
 Can't keep my feet on the ground
 Everything seems unreal now
 When you're not around
 
 Day Dream
 Why do you haunt me so?
 Deep in a rosy glow 
 The face of my love you show
 
 Day Dream
 I walk along on air
 Building a castle there
 For me and my love to share
 
 Don't know the time
 Lordy, I'm in a daze
 Sun in the sky
 While I moon around, feeling hazy
 
 Day Dream
 Don't break my reverie
 Until I find that he
 Is day dreaming just like me

 Don't break my reverie
 Until I find that he

 Day in, day out
 That same old voodoo follows me about
 That same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
 And, darling, I think of you, day in and day out
 
 Day out, day in
 I needn't tell you how my days begin
 When I awake, I get up with a tingle, one possibility in view
 That possibility of maybe seeing you
 
 Come rain, come shine
 I meet you and to me the day is fine
 Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
 The ocean's roar, a thousand drums
 
 Can't you see it's love?
 Can there be any doubt
 When there it is
 Day in and day out?
 
 I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you, come rain or come shine
 I meet you and to me the day is fine
 Then I kiss your lips and the pounding becomes
 The ocean's roar, a thousand drums
 
 Can't you see it's love
 Can there be any doubt
 When there it is
 
 There it is, day in, day out
 There it is, day in
 There it is, there it is
 There, there, there it is
 There it is, there it is
 Day out
 
 The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play
 Through a meadowland toward a closing door
 A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before
 
 The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories
 Of the golden smile that introduced me to
 The days of wine and roses and you
 
  just a passing breeze filled with memories
 Of the golden smile that introduced me to
 The days of wine and roses and you
 
 If I should write a book for you
 That brought me fame and fortune too
 That book would be like my heart and me
 Dedicated to you
 
 And if I should paint a picture too
 That showed the loveliness of you
 My art would be like my heart and me
 Dedicated to you
 
 To you because your love is
 The beacon that lights up my way
 To you because with you I know
 One lifetime could be just one heavenly place
 
 If I should find a twinkling star
 One half so wondrous as you are
 That star would be like my heart and me
 Dedicated to you
 
 To you because your love is
 A beacon that lights up my way
 To you because with you I know
 One lifetime could be just one heavenly place
 
 If I should find a twinkling star
 One half so wondrous as you are
 That star would be like my heart and me
 Dedicated to you
 
 Oh, cover me with Dixie skies
 While the wind is crooning lullabies
 Tuck me into paradise
 Somewhere deep in the heart of the south
 
 Yellow moon is hangin' low
 Over fields of cotton white as snow
 My heart longs to turn in hope
 Somewhere deep in the heart of the south
 
 Laughter fills the afternoon, and every evening
 Lovers linger on the Swanee shore
 I can see magnolias bloom around a cabin door
 And that's where I'm goin', sure as you're born
 
 I'm a weary rollin' stone
 Made my mind up and I'm rollin' home
 Come on, feet, and start to roam
 Somewhere deep in the heart of the south
 
 Laughter fills the afternoon, and every evening
 Lovers linger on the Swanee shore
 I can see magnolias bloom around a cabin door
 And that's where I'm goin', sure as you're born
 
 I'm a weary rollin' stone
 Made my mind up and I'm rollin' home
 Come on, feet, and start to roam
 Somewhere deep in the heart of the south
 
 Say come on, feet, and do your stuff
 The way is long and the road is rough
 Somewhere deep in the heart of the south
 
 Woo, 
 Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
 Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
 Wo-o-oo-wo-wo
 When the deep purple falls
 Over sleepy garden walls
 And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
 In the mist of a memory
 You wander all back to me
 Breathing my name with a sigh
 
 In the still of the night
 Once again I hold you tight
 Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
 And as long as my heart will beat
 Sweet lover, we'll always meet
 Here in my deep purple dreams
 
 When the deep purple falls
 Over sleepy garden walls
 And the stars begin to twinkle
 In the night
 In the mist of a memory
 You wander all back to me
 Breathing my name with a sigh
 
 In the still of the night 
 Once again I hold you tight
 Tho' you're gone your love lives on when moonlight beams
 And as long as my heart will beat
 Sweet lover, we'll always meet
 Here in my deep purple dreams
 And as long as my heart will beat
 Sweet lover, we'll always meet
 Here in my deep purple dreams
 Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
 Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
 Wo-o-oo-wo-wo
 
 Love is like a never-ending melody 
 Always have compared it to a symphony 
 A symphony conducted by the lighting of the moon 
 But our song of love is slightly out of tune 
 Once your kisses raised me to a fever pitch 
 Now the orchestration doesn't seem so rich 
 Seems to me you've changed the tune we used to sing 
 Like the bossa nova, love should swing 
 We used to harmonize, two souls in perfect time 
 Now the song is different and the words don't even rhyme 
 Cause you forgot the melody our hearts would always croon 
 So what good's a heart that's slightly out of tune 
 Tune your heart to mine the way it used to be 
 Join with me in harmony and sing a song of loving 
 We've got to get in tune again before too long 
 There'll be no desafinado 
 When your heart belongs to me completely 
 Then you won't be slightly out of tune 
 You'll sing along with me
 
 Smooth road, clear day
 But why am I the only one travelin' this way?
 How strange--the road to love should be so easy
 Can't you see the detour ahead?
 
 Wake up, slow down
 Before you crash and break your heart, gullible clown
 You fool, you're headed in the wrong direction
 Can't you see the detour ahead?
 
 The further you travel, the harder to unravel the web
 She spins around you
 Turn back while there's time
 Don't you see the danger sign?
 Soft shoulders surround you
 
 Smooth road, clear night
 Oh, lucky me that suddenly I saw the light
 I'm turning back away from all that sorrow
 Smooth road, clear day
 No detour ahead
 
 The further you travel, the harder to unravel the web
 She spins around you
 Turn back while there's time
 Don't you see the danger sign?
 Soft shoulders surround you
 
 Smooth road, clear night
 Oh, lucky me that suddenly I saw the light
 I'm turning back away from all that sorrow
 Smooth road, clear day
 No detour ahead
 
 Zulu man is feelin' blue
 Gear his heart beat a little tattoo
 Diga diga doo diga doo doo
 Diga diga doo diga doo
 
 You love me and I love you
 And when you love it is natural to 
 Diga diga doo diga doo doo
 Diga diga doo diga doo
 
 I'm so very diga diga doo by nature
 If you don't say diga diga to your mate
 You're gonna lose a papa.
 
 So let those funny people smile
 How can there be a Virgin isle
 With diga diga doo diga doo doo
 Diga diga doo diga doo 
 
 No one heeds the marriage laws
 Yours is mine and mine is yours
 With diga diga doo diga doo doo
 Diga diga doo diga doo 
 
 Sky, so vast is the sky, with far away clouds just wandering by
 Where do they go? Oh, I don't know, don't know
 Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes
 Stories of love belong to you and to me
 
 Oh, Dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
 Things that I see when you're with me, oh, my Dindi
 Oh, Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
 Singing Dindi, happy Dindi, when you're with me
 
 I love you more each day; yes, I do; yes, I do
 I'd let you go away if you take me with you
 
 Don't you know, Dindi, I'd be running and searching for you
 Like a river that can't find the sea
 That would be me without you, my Dindi
 Can't find the sea
 That would be me without you, Dindi
 
 Like a river that can't find the sea
 That would be me without you, my Dindi
 
 Once there was a wicked witch in the lovely land of Oz
 And a wickeder, wickeder, wickeder witch there never, never was
 She filled the folks in Munchkin land with terror and with dread
 'Till one fine day from Kansas way a cyclone caught a house 
 That brought the wicked, wicked witch her doom 
 As she was flying on her broom
 For the house fell on her head and the coroner pronounced her dead
 And thru the town the joyous news was spread
 
 Ding-dong, the witch is dead! Which old witch? The wicked witch
 Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
 Wake up, you sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
 Wake up, the wicked witch is dead!
 She's gone where the goblins go below, below, below, yo ho
 Let's open up and sing, and ring the bells out
 Ding-dong! the merry-o sing it high, sing it low
 Let them know the wicked witch is dead
 
 Ding-dong, the witch is dead! Which old witch? The wicked witch
 Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
 Wake up, you sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
 Wake up, the wicked witch is dead!
 She's gone where the goblins go below, below, below, yo ho
 Let's open up and sing, and ring the bells out
 Ding-dong! the merry-o sing it high, sing it low
 Let them know the wicked witch is dead
 
 Dites-moi
 Pourquoi
 La vie est belle,
 Dies-moi
 Pourquoi
 La vie est gai,
 Dites-moi
 Pourquoi,
 Chere Mad'moiselle,
 Est-ce que
 Parce que
 Vous m'aimez?
 
 Dites-moi
 Pourquoi,
 Chere Mad'moiselle,
 Est-ce que
 Parce que
 Vous m'aimez?
 
 Tell me why
 The sky is filled with music,
 Tell me why
 We fly on clouds above
 Can it be
 That we
 Can fly to music
 Just because,
 Just because
 We're in love?
 
 Do I love you, do I?
 Doesn't one and one make two?
 Do I love you do I?
 Does July need a sky of blue?
 Would I miss you, would I
 If you ever should go away?
 If the sun should desert the day
 What would life be?
 
 Will I leave you, never?
 Could the ocean leave the shore?
 Will I worship you forever?
 Isn't heaven forevermore?
 Do I love you, do I?
 Oh, my dear it's so easy to see
 Don't you know I do, don't I show you I do?
 Just as you love me
 
 Will I leave you, never?
 Could the ocean leave the shore?
 Will I worship you forever?
 Isn't heaven forevermore?
 Do I love you, do I?
 Oh, my dear, it's so easy to see
 Don't you know I do, don't I show you I do?
 Just as you love me
 
 Someone told someone and someone told you
 But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
 Since everyone spread the story 
 With his own little personal touch
 
 Do nothin' till you hear from me
 Pay no attention to what's said
 Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
 Is over my head
 Do nothin' till you hear from me
 At least consider our romance
 If you should take the word of others you've heard
 I haven't a chance
 True I've been seen with someone new
 But does that mean that I'm untrue
 When we're apart the words in my heart
 Reveal how I feel about you
 Some kiss may cloud my memory
 And other arms may hold a thrill
 But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
 And you never will
 Do nothin' till you hear from me
 
 Do nothin' till you hear from me
 Pay no attention to what's said
 Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream 
 Is over my head
 Do nothin' till you hear from me
 At least consider our romance
 If you should take the word of others you've heard
 I haven't a chance
 True I've been seen with someone new
 But does that mean that I'm untrue
 When we're apart the words in my heart
 Reveal how I feel about you
 Some kiss may cloud my memory
 And other arms may hold a thrill
 But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
 And you never will
 
 I must confess what you say is true
 I had a rendezvous with somebody new
  that's the only one I ever had
 Baby, baby, don'cha go 'way mad
 
 Cheatin' shows and it never goes
 You've got a reason to be mad I suppose
 But he only was a passing fad
 Baby, don'cha be mad
 
 His kind's a dime a dozen
 And that's not the kind I want 
 Who'd ever dream your cousin
 Would wander in to that restaurant? 
 
 I understand that you feel  upset
 What do you say, that you forgive and forget?
 Come on and kiss me just to show you're glad
 Baby, baby , don'cha go 'way mad
 
 April skies are in your eyes
 But darling, don't be blue
 Don't cry, oh honey, please
 Don't be that way
 
 Clouds in the sky
 Should never make you feel that way
 The rain will bring the violets of May
 Tears are in vain, so honey, please
 Don't be that way
 
 As long as we see it through
 You'll have me, I'll have you
 Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day
 Don't break my heart, oh honey, please
 Don't be that way
 
 Don't cry, oh honey, please
 Don't be that way
 Clouds in the sky
 Should never make you feel that way
 The rain will bring the violets of May
 Tears in vain, so honey, please
 Don't be that way
 
 As long as we will see it through
 You'll have me and I'll have you
 Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day
 Don't break my heart, oh honey, please
 Don't be that way
 
 Don't cry
 
 Oh honey, please
 Don't be that way
 
 Clouds in the sky
 
 Should never make you feel that way
 
 Dig the rain
 
 Bring the violets of May
 
 Tears in vain
 
 So honey, please
 Don't be that way
 
 As long as we will see it through
 Oh baby, you'll have me and I'll have you
 Sweetheart, tomorrow is another day
 
 Don't break my heart
 Oh honey, please
 Don't be that way
 Look here, baby don't cry
 Oh honey, please
 Don't be that way
 Clouds in the sky
 Should never make you feel that way
 
 Yeah, don't cry
 Honey, please don't be that way
 Clouds in the sky
 Oh honey, please
 Don't be that way
 
 Though you vacation in Hawaii
 Or go to Switzerland to ski
 When you're scanning the snow-covered mountain
 Or fanning yourself by the sea
 Don't dream of anybody but me
 
 Though you may fly the Scottish Highlands
 Or take a trip to some isle near Napoli
 When you're whistling "The Campbells Are Coming"
 Or humming "The Isle Of Capri"
 Don't dream of anybody but me
 
 In a cafe on the Rhine
 Any place along the line
 I'll forgive you when a stranger
 Puts your little heart in danger
 If his face resembles mine
 
 When a guy at a mike in a nightclub
 Begins bellowing something off-key
 Won't even mind if suddenly he reminds you of me
 
 No matter where you care to roam
 Doesn't even matter whom you choose to see
 Whenever your head hits that pillow
 Whatever the hour may be
 Don't dream of anybody but me
 Don't dream of anybody but me
 Don't dream of anybody but me
 
 Hush now, don't explain
 Just say you'll remain
 I'm glad you're back, don't explain
 
 Quiet, don't explain
 What is there to gain
 Skip that lipstick
 Don't explain
 
 You know that I love you
 And what love endures
 All my thoughts of you
 For I'm so completely yours
 
 Cry to hear folks chatter
 And I know you cheat
 Right or wrong, don't matter
 When you're with me, sweet
 
 Hush now, don't explain
 You're my joy and pain
 My life's yours, love
 Don't explain
 
 You know that I love you
 And what love endures
 Nothing rates above you
 For I'm so completely yours
 
 Cry to hear folks chatter
 And I know you cheat
 Right or wrong, don't matter
 When you're with me, sweet
 
 Hush now, don't explain
 You're my joy and pain
 My life's yours, love
 Don't explain
 
 Wildcat kelley, lookin' mighty pale
 Was standin' by the sherrif's side
 And when the sherrif said "I'm sendin you to jail
 Wildcat raised his head and cried
 
 Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above
 Don't fence me in
 Let me ride through the wide-open country that I love
 Don't fence me in
 Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
 Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
 Send me off forever, but I ask you, please
 Don't fence me in
 
 Just turn me loose, let me straddle my ol' saddle underneath the western skies
 On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder 'till I see the mountains rise
 
 I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
 Gaze at the moon 'till I lose my senses
 I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
 Don't fence me in
 
 Wildcat kelley, back again in town
 Was standin by his sweetheart's side
 And when his sweetheart said "come on, let's settle down
 Wildcat raised his head and cried
 
 Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above
 Don't fence me in
 Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
 Don't fence me in
 Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
 Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
 Send me off forever but I ask you please
 Don't fence me in
 
 Just turn me loose, let me straddle my ol' saddle underneath the western skies
 On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder 'till I see the mountains rise
 
 I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
 Gaze at the moon 'till I lose my senses
 Can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
 Don't fence me in
 
 Missed the Saturday dance
 Heard they crowded the floor
 Couldn't bear it without you
 Don't get around much anymore
 
 Thought I'd visit the club
 Got as far as the door
 They'd have asked me about you
 Don't get around much anymore
 
 Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
 But nevertheless, why stir up memories?
 
 Been invited on dates
 Might have gone but what for
 Awfully different without you
 Don't get around much anymore
 
 Don't tell me not to fly
 I've simply got to
 If someone takes a spill
 It's me and not you
 Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade
 
 Don't tell me not to leave
 Just sit and putter
 Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter
 Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade?
 
 I'll march my band out
 I'll beat my drum
 And if I'm fanned out
 Your turn at bat, sir
 At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir
 I guess I didn't make it
 
 But whether I'm the rose of sheer perfection
 A freckle on the nose of life's complexion
 A Cinderella or a shine apple of an eye
 I gotta fly once
 I gotta try once
 Only can die once, right, sir?
 Oh, life is juicy
 Juicy and you see
 I gotta have my bite, sir
 
 Get ready for me, love
 'Cause I'm a comer
 I simply gotta march
 My heart's a drummer
 Don't bring around the cloud to rain on my parade
 
 Yes, sir
 No, sir
 I'm gonna live and live now
 Get what I want--I know how
 All that the law will allow
 One roll for the whole shebang
 One throw, that bell will go clang
 Though I'm alone, I'm a gang
 Eye on the target and wham
 One shot, one gun shot, and bam
 
 Hey, world, here I am
 Get ready for me life 'cause I'm a comer
 I simply gotta march; my heart's a drummer
 Nobody, no, nobody is gonna rain on my parade
 
 Don't worry 'bout me
 I'll get along
 Forget about me
 Be happy, my love
 
 Let's say that our little show is over
 And so the story ends
 Why not call it a day the sensible way
 And still be friends
 
 Look out for yourself
 So the ways be the rule
 Give your heart and your love to whom ever you love
 Don't you be a fool
 
 Darlin', why stop to cling to some fading thing
 That used to be?
 If you can't forget
 Don't you worry 'bout me
 
 Baby, why should you cling to some fading thing
 That used to be?
 If you can't forget
 Don't you worry 'bout me
 
 
 With a million neon rainbows burning below me
 And a million blazing taxis raising a roar
 Here I sit, above the town
 In my pet-palliated gown
 Down in the depths
 Of the ninetieth floor
 While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet
 And the bars are packed with couples calling for more
 I'm deserted and depressed
 In my regal-eagle nest
 Down in the depths
 Of the ninetieth floor
 When the only one you wanted wants another
 What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
 Why, even the janitor's wife
 Has a perfectly good love life
 And here I am, facing tomorrow
 Alone in my sorrow
 Down in the depths
 Of the ninetieth floor
 
 Gee, but it's hard to love someone when that someone don't love you! 
 I'm so disgusted, heart-broken, too; I've got those down-hearted blues; 
 Once I was crazy 'bout a man; he mistreated me all the time, 
 The next man I get has got to promise me to be mine, all mine! 
 
 Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days, 
 Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days,
 It seems like trouble going to follow me to my grave. 
 
 I ain't never loved but three men's in my life,
 I ain't never loved but three men in my life,
 My father, my brother, the man that wrecked my life. 
 
 It may be a week, it may be a month or two, 
 It may be a week, it may be a month or two, 
 But the day you quit me, honey, it's comin' home to you. 
 
 I got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand, 
 I got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand, 
 I'm gonna hold it until you meet some of my demands.
 
 Get in touch with that sundown fellow
 As he tiptoes across the sand
 He's got a million kinds of stardust
 Pick your favourite brand, and
 
 Dream, when you're feeling blue
 Dream, that's the thing to do
 Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air
 You'll find your share of memories there
 
 So dream when the day is through
 Dream, and they might come true
 Things never are as bad as they seem
 So dream, dream, dream
 
 Dream when the day is through
 Dream, and they might come true
 Things never are as bad as they seem
 So dream, dream, dream
 Dream
 So dream, dream, dream
 
 Stars shining bright above you
 Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
 Birds singing in the sycamore trees
 Dream a little dream of me
 
 Say nighty-night and kiss me
 Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
 While I'm alone and blue as can be
 Dream a little dream of me
 
 Stars fading but I linger on dear
 Still craving your kiss
 I'm longing to linger till dawn dear
 Just saying this
 
 Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
 Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
 But in your dreams whatever they be
 Dream a little dream of me
 
 Stars fading but I linger on dear
 Still craving your kiss
 I'm longing to linger till dawn dear
 Just saying this
 
 Sweet dreams, till sunbeams find you
 Gotta keep dreaming leave all worries behind you
 But in your dreams whatever they be
 You gotta make me a promise, promise to me
 You'll dream, dream a little of me
 
 When day is gone and night comes on
 Until the dawn what do I do?
 I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land
 Dream dancing with you
 
 We dance between a sky serene
 And fields of green sparkling with dew
 It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time
 Dream dancing with you
 
 Dream dancing
 Oh, what a lucky windfall
 Touching you, clutching you
 All the night through
 
 So say you love me, dear
 And let me make my career
 Dream dancing, dream dancing with you
 
 When day is gone and night comes on
 Until the dawn what do I do?
 I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land
 Dream dancing with you
 
 We dance between a sky serene
 And fields of green sparkling with dew
 It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time
 Dream dancing with you
 
 Dream dancing
 Oh, what a lucky windfall
 Holding you, clutching you
 All the night through
 
 So say you love me, dear
 And let me make my career
 Dream dancing, dream dancing
 With you, with you, with you
 
 Why are my eyes always full of this vision of you
 Why do I dream silly dreams that I fear won't come true
 I long to show you the stars
 Caught in the dark of the sea
 I long to speak of my love but you don't come to me
 So I go on asking if maybe one day you'll care
 I tell my sad little dreams to the soft evening air
 I am quite hopeless it seems, two things I know how to do
 One is to dream
 Two is loving you
 
 Dim the light, little man
 And tonight, little man
 On a ship of dreams you'll sail
 
 Dreams are made for children
 And a dream is a fairytale
 
 You don't need a magic wand
 To see all that lies beyond
 If you just believe in fairyland
 Fairyland appears
 
 Dream away, little man
 Dream as long as you can
 Don't grow up, I beg of you
 
 Dreams are made for children
 And for children dreams come true
 
 Drop me off in Harlem
 Any place in Harlem
 There's someone waiting there
 Who makes it seem like Heaven up in Harlem
 
 I don't want your Dixie
 You can keep your Dixie
 There's no one down in Dixie
 Who can take me 'way from my hot Harlem
 
 Harlem has those southern skies,
 They're in my baby's smile, 
 I idolize my baby's eyes
 And classy up-town style
 
 If Harlem moved to China,
 I know of nothing finer,
 Than to stow away on a 'plane some day
 And have them drop me off in Harlem

 Baby, take me down to Duke's Place
 Wildest box in town is Duke's Place
 Love that piano sound in Duke's Place
 
 Saxes do their tricks in Duke's Place
 Fellas swing their chicks in Duke's Place
 Come on, get your kicks in Duke's Place
 
 You find yourself a seat, and when you want to eat
 You look around and yell, ?Waiter?
 You fill your cup chock full of dreams and drink it up
 You're jetting along with your girlie
 
 It's after three o'clock, but baby, it's early
 If you've never been to Duke's Place
 Take your tootsies into Duke's Place
 Life is in a spin in Duke's Place
 
 Baby, take me down to Duke's Place
 Wildest box in town is Duke's Place
 Love that piano sound in Duke's Place

 When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze
 And touches with her hand the summer trees,
 Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
 There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,
 
 A winding country lane all russet brown,
 A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
 That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
 Seemed made for just a boy and girl.
 
 I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
 So early, early.
 Darling if you care, please, let me know,
 I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
 Let's never have to share another early autumn.
 
 East of the sun and west of the moon
 We'll build a dream house so lovely
 Near to the sun in a day, near to the moon at night
 We'll live in a lovely way dear
 
 Living our love in memory
 Just you and I, forever and a day
 Love will not die; we'll keep it that way
 Up among the stars we'll find
 
 A harmony of life, too lovely tune
 East of the sun and west of the moon, dear
 East of the sun and west of the moon
 
 Living for you is easy living
 It's easy to live when you're in love
 And I'm so in love
 There's nothing in life but you
 
 I'll never regret the things I'm giving
 They're easy to give when you're in love
 I'm happy to do whatever I do for you
 
 For you maybe I'm a fool, but it's fun
 People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
 Darling, it's grand; they just don't understand
 
 Living for you is easy living
 It's easy to live when you're in love
 And I'm so in love
 There's nothing in life but you
 
 For you maybe I'm a fool, but it's fun
 People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
 Darling, it's grand; they just don't understand
 
 Living for you is easy living
 It's easy to live when you're in love
 And I'm so in love
 There's nothing in life but you
 
 I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
 In thinking such a thing could be
 That you could ever care for me
 I'm sure you hate to hear that I adore you, dear
 But grant me, just the same
 I'm not entirely to blame
 
 For you'd be so easy to love
 So easy to idolize
 All others above
 
 So worth the yearning for
 So swell to keep every home fire burning for
 We'd be so grand at the game
 So carefree together
 
 That it does seem a shame
 That you can't see
 Your future with me
 'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love
 
 We'd be so grand at the game
 So carefree together
 That it does seem a shame
 That you can't see
 Your future with me
 'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love
 
 Lo andas diciendo que me vas abandonar
 Porque me vuelas que ya voy hacer feliz
 Y hasta presiento que ya Dios me hizo el milagro
 Que tanto he so'ado
 Mirarte partir
 
 Tu dices que vas
 Y yo no s' porque
 Porque tu indecisi'n ha sido tan infiel
 
 Yo te aconsejo que te vayas de un calor
 Que yo esta noche tengo un nuevo amanecer
 
 Y yo en confianza te digo vida m'a
 Que me haces martezio
 Con otro querer
 
 Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you
 Embrace me, you irreplaceable you
 
 Just one look at you
 My heart grew tipsy in me
 You and you alone
 Bring out the Gypsy in me
 
 I love all the many charms about you
 Above all, I want my arms about you
 
 Don't be a naughty baby
 Come to mama, come to mama do
 My sweet embraceable you
 
 I love all the many charms about you
 Above all, I want my arms about you
 
 Don't be a naughty baby
 Come to mama, come to mama do
 My sweet embraceable you
 
 Don't stamp your foot at me,
 It's impolite
 To stamp your foot at me
 Is not quite right.
 At man's ingratitude
 A woman winks,
 But such an attitude just stinks.
 
 I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks.
 I have words that do not come from children's books
 there's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
 And everything I've got belongs to you.
 I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist,
 And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist.
 There are hammerlock holds,
 I've mastered a few,
 And everything I've got belongs to you.
 Share for share, share alike,
 You get struck each time I strike.
 You for me, me for me
 I'll give you plenty of nothing.
 I'm not yours for better but for worse,
 And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse.
 I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two,
 And everything I've got belongs to you.
 
 Don't raise your voice at me,
 That's very rude.
 To raise your voice at me
 Is rather crude.
 It's wrong essentially when woman yells,
 And confidentially, it smells.
 
 I'll converse with you on politics at length,
 I'll protect you with my superhuman strength.
 If you're ever attacked I'll scream and say , "Boo!"
 And everything I've got belongs to you.
 I will never stray from home, I'll just stay put,
 'Cause I've got a brand-new thing called athlete' s foot.
 I'm a victim of colds, anemia, too,
 And everything I've got belongs to you.
 Off to bed we will creep,
 Then we'll sleep and sleep and sleep
 'Til the birds start to peep.
 I'll give you plenty of nothing.
 I'll be
 
 Everyday, everyday I have the blues
 Oh, everyday, everyday I have the blues
 When you see me worryin', baby, yeah, it's you I hate to lose
 
 Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
 Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
 Well, worries and trouble, darling, babe, you know I've had my share
 
 Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
 Everyday, everyday I have the blues
 When you see me worryin', baby, yeah, it's you I hate to lose
 
 Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
 Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
 Well, worries and trouble darling, babe, you know I've had my share
 
 Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little,
 Everytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
 Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.
 Think so little of me, they allow you to go.
 When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
 I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
 There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to
 minor,
 Everytime we say goodbye.

 Soon you'll hear a tune
 That's gonna lift you out of your seat
 It could be sweeter, but then the meter
 Was written especially for your feet
 Fly away up high
 Upon a syncopated balloon
 A little ginger will never injure
 Hear them tuning up; they'll be playing soon
 
 Everybody step to the syncopated rhythm
 Let's be goin' with 'em when they begin
 You'll be sayin', "Yes, sir, the band is grand
 He's the best professor in all the land"
 
 Listen to the pep that emerges from the middle
 Of the jazzy fiddle under his chin
 Oh, what music
 The clarineter could not be better
 
 Hear that strain
 I don't know just what it is, but it's great
 They simply ruin it
 Look at 'em doin' it
 Come, come, don't hesitate
 
 Everybody step if you want to see a glutton
 When it comes to struttin' over the ground
 Wait'll you see my little sweetie and me
 Step, step, stepping around
 
 Everyone's saying you'll break my heart
 But I just can't agree
 'Cause I love you
 Everyone's wrong but me
 
 I keep repeating we'll never part
 They tell me wait and see
 Still, I love you
 Everyone's wrong but me
 
 Till the end of time
 This much I know is true
 Till the end of time
 I'll go on loving you, only you
 
 Tell them you love me right from the start
 And when they disagree
 Just you tell them
 Everyone was wrong but me
 
 'Cause I love you
 Everyone's wrong but me
 Oh, still, I love you
 Everyone's wrong but me
 
 Tell them you love me right from the start
 And when they disagree
 Just you tell them
 Everyone was wrong but me
 
 And when they disagree
 And when they disagree
 Just tell them
 That everyone's wrong but me
 
 You left me a horse from Texas,
 A house with installments due,
 A letter with lots of x-s
 Everything but you.
 
 You left me some beans from Boston,
 A bicycle built for two,
 A memory to get lost in,
 Everything but you.
 
 Each day was so gay and so daring,
 I loved every breathtaking minute,
 For how could I know I was sharing
 A kiss without a future in it.
 
 You left me a dream to room with,
 A coffee pot from Peru,
 A knife and fork to spoon with,
 Everything but you.

 Black cats creep across my path
 Until I'm almost mad
 I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
 'Cause all my luck is bad
 I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
 I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
 I guess I'll go through life just catching colds and missin' trains
 
 Everything happens to me
 I never miss a thing
 I've had the measles and the mumps
 And every time I play an ace
 My partner always trumps
 Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps
 
 Everything happens to me
 At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
 That love would turn the trick to end despair
 But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
 I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
 I've telegraphed and phoned
 I send an 'Airmail Special' too
 Your answer was 'Goodbye'
 And there was even postage due
 I fell in love just once
 And then it had to be with you
 
 Everything happens to me
 
 I know why I've waited, know why I've been blue
 Prayed each night for someone exactly like you
 Why should we spend money on a show or two?
 No one does those love scenes exactly like you
 
 You make me feel so grand; I'd like to hand the world to you
 You seem to understand each foolish little scheme I'm scheming
 And the dream I'm dreaming
 Now I know why my mother taught me to be true
 She meant me for someone exactly like you
 
 You make me feel so grand; I wanna hand the world to you
 You seem to understand each foolish little scheme that I'm scheming

 Fairy tales were the tales that you told me
 Fairy tales made me happy as I could be
 For I had been dreaming of some day
 But now somehow it's all faded away
 
 Fairy tales, like a child I believed you
 Fairy tales, none of them came true
 But sometimes in my dreams, I can hear you, it seems
 Telling me the same old fairy tales
 
 Oh, fairy tales were the tales that you told me

 Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
 That pit a pats through my brain
 So darn persistent
 The day isn't distant
 When it'll drive me insane
 Comes in the morning
 Without any warning
 And hangs around me all day
 I'll have to sneak up to it
 Someday, and speak up to it
 I hope it listens when I say
 
 Fascinating rhythm
 You've got me on the go
 Fascinating rhythm
 I'm all a quiver
 
 What a mess you're making
 The neighbors want to know
 Why I'm always shaking
 Just like a fliver
 
 Each morning I get up with the sun
 Start a hopping
 Never stopping
 To find at night no work has been done
 
 I know that
 Once it didn't matter
 But now you're doing wrong
 When you start to patter
 I'm so unhappy
 
 Won't you take a day off
 Decide to run along
 Somewhere far away off
 And make it snappy
 
 Oh, how I long to be the girl I used to be
 Fascinating rhythm
 Oh won't you stop picking on me
 
 I know that
 Once it didn't matter
 But now you're doing wrong
 When you start to patter
 I'm so unhappy
 
 Won't you take a day off
 Decide to run along
 Somewhere far away off
 And make it snappy
 
 Oh, how I long to be the girl I used to be
 Fascinating rhythm
 Fascinating rhythm
 Won't you stop picking on me
 
 Feelings, nothing more than feelings
 Trying to forget my feelings of love
 Teardrops rolling down on my face
 Trying to forget my feelings of love
 Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it
 I wish I've never met you
 You'll never come again
 Feeling, woo-o-o feeling
 Woo-o-o, feel you again in my arms
 Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
 And feelings like I'll never have you again in my heart
 Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it
 I wish I've never met you; you'll never come again
 Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
 And feelings like I'll never have you again in my life
 Feelings, woo-o-o feeling it,
 woo-o-o, feeling again in my arms
 Feelings
 
 Never know how much I love you
 Never know how much I care
 When you put your arms around me
 I get a fever that's so hard to bear,
 You give me Fever....when you kiss me
 Fever when you hold me tight
 Fever....in the morning
 Fever all through the night.
 
 Sun lights up the daytime
 Moon lights up the night
 I light up when you call my name
 And you know I'm gonna treat you right,
 You give me Fever....when you kiss me
 Fever when you hold me tight
 Fever.....in the morning
 Fever all through the night.
 
 Everybodys got the Fever
 That is something you all know
 Fever is such a nuisance
 Fever started long ago.
 
 Romeo loved Julliet
 Julliet she felt the same
 But when he put his arms around her
 He said Julie baby you're my flame
 I'll give you Fever.....when you kiss me
 Fever when I flame in you
 Fever.....I'm on fire
 Fever, yea I burn for you
 
 Captain Smith and Pocahontas
 Had a very mad affair
 But when her daddy tried to kill him
 She said Daddy oh don't you dare
 He gives me Fever....with his kisses
 Fever when he holds me tight
 Fever....I'm his misses
 Daddy won't you treat him right
 
 Now you've listened to my story
 Here's the point that I have made
 Chicks were born to give you Fever
 Be it fair and hide or sandy grey
 They give you Fever...when you kiss them
 Fever when you live and learn
 Fever....till you're sizzlin'
 But what a lovely way to burn.
 
 My man don't love me
 Treats me oh-so mean
 My man he don't love me
 Treats me awful mean
 He's the lowest man
 That I've ever seen
 
 He wears high-trimmed pants
 Stripes are really yellow
 He wears high-trimmed pants
 Stripes are really yellow
 
 But when he starts in to love me
 He's so fine and mellow
 
 Love will make you drink and gamble
 Make you stay out all night long
 Make you stay out all night long
 Love will make you drink and gamble
 Make you stay out all night long
 Make you stay out all night long
 
 Love will make you do things
 That you know is wrong
 
 But if you treat me right, baby
 I'll stay home everyday
 Just treat me right, baby
 I'll stay home night and day
 
 But you're so mean to me, baby
 I know you're gonna drive me away
 
 Love is just like the faucet
 It turns off and on
 Love is just like the faucet
 It turns off and on
 
 Sometimes when you think it's on, baby
 It has turned off and gone
 
 The five o'clock whistle's on the blink
 The whistle won't blow and whadd'ya think?
 My pop is still in the factory 'cause he don't know
 What time it happens to be
 
 The five o'clock whistle didn't blow
 The whistle is broke and whadda'ya know?
 If somebody don't find out what's wrong
 Oh, my pop'll be workin' all night long
 
 Oh, who's gonna fix the whistle?
 Won't somebody fix the whistle?
 Oh, who's gonna fix the whistle?
 So my poor old pop will know
 It's time for him to stop
 
 Ya ought to hear what my mommy said
 When papa came home and sneaked into bed
 And told her he worked till half past two
 'Cause the five o'clock whistle never blew
 
 Poets often use many words to say a simple thing
 It takes thought and time and rhyme
 To make a poem sing
 With music and words I've been playing
 
 For you I have written this song
 To be sure you known what I'm saying
 I'll translate as I go along
 
 Fly me to the moon,
 And let me play among the stars.
 Let me see what spring is like,
 On Jupiter and Mars.
 In other words, hold my hand,
 In other words, darling kiss me.
 
 Fill my heart with song,
 And let me sing forever more,
 You are all I long for,
 All I worship and adore,
 In other words, please be true,
 In other words, I love you.
 
 Fill my heart with song,
 And let me sing forever more,
 You are all I long for,
 All I worship and adore,
 In other words, please be true,
 In other words, I love you.
 
 We're sitting out here on the runway
 Waiting for the plane to leave
 And the captain says, "There'll be a short delay
 Bear with me, please"
 
 They gave us the usual hassle
 "You can't take those guitars on board"
 But the boys in the band just smiled
 Heard it all before
 
 And as they're starting to serve champagne
 To the folks at the front of the plane
 I can hear the engines roaring
 We're on our way
 
 And we are flying home
 I feel the freedom in my soul
 Flying home at last
 Flying home
 I've got the freedom in my soul
 
 And it's four in the morning
 My world is calling
 Speeding through the universe tonight
 
 The movie reminds of my lady
 As she waits, "Where are those guys?"
 Yes, it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky
 
 And now the sun is beginning to rise
 It's like looking down on Paradise
 There's a ball of fire that's burning
 Giving life
 
 And we are flying home
 I feel the freedom in my soul
 Flying home at last
 Flying home
 I've got the freedom in my soul
 
 And it's four in the morning
 My world is calling
 Speeding through the universe tonight
 
 For once in my life I've got someone who needs me
 Someone I've needed so long
 For once unafraid I can go where life leads me
 And somehow I know I'll be strong
 
 For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
 Long before I knew
 Someone warm like you
 
 Could make my dreams come true
 
 For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
 Not like it's hurt me before
 For once I've got someone I know won't desert me
 And I'm not alone anymore
 
 For once I can say: ;this is mine you can't take it;
 As long as I've got love I know I can make it
 For once in my life I've got someone who needs me
 
 Paradise can not refuse us
 Never such a happy pair
 
 Everybody must excuse us
 If we walk on air
 
 All the shadows now will lose us
 Lucky stars are everywhere
 
 As a happy being
 Here's what I'm foreseeing
 
 For you, for me, forever more
 It's bound to be forever more
 
 It's plain to see
 We found, by finding each other
 The love we waited for
 
 I'm yours, you're mine
 And in our hearts
 The happy ending starts
 
 What a lovely world
 This world will be
 With a world of love in store
 For you, for me, forever more
 
 What a lovely world
 This world will be
 With a world of love in store
 For you, for me, forever more
 
 From this moment on, you for me dear
 Only two for tea dear, from this moment on
 From this happy day, no more blue songs
 Only whoop-dee-doo songs, from this moment on
 
 For you've got the love I need so much
 Got the skin I love to touch
 Got the arms to hold me tight
 Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
 From this moment on, you and I, babe
 We'll be ridin' high, babe
 Every care is gone, from this moment on
 
 From this happy day, no more blue songs
 Only whoop-dee-doo songs, from this moment on
 
 For you've got the love I need so much
 Got the skin I love to touch
 Got the arms to hold me tight
 Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
 From this moment on, you and I, babe
 We'll be ridin' high, babe
 Every care is gone, from this moment on
 
 Frosty the Snowman
 Was a jolly happy soul
 With a corncob pipe and a button nose
 And two eyes made out of coal
 Frosty the Snowman
 
 Is a fairytale they say
 He was made of snow
 But the children know
 How he came to life one day
 There must have been some magic
 
 In that old silk hat they found
 For when they placed it on his head
 He began to dance around
 Frosty the Snowman
 
 Was alive as he could be
 And the children say
 He could laugh and play
 Just the same as you and me
 Frosty the Snowman
 
 Knew the sun was hot that day
 So he said let's run
 And we'll have some fun
 Now before I melt away
 Down to the village
 
 With a broomstick in his hand
 Running here and there all around the square
 Saying catch me if you can
 He led them down the streets of town
 
 Right to the traffic cop
 And he only paused a moment when
 He heard him holler stop
 Frosty the Snowman
 
 Had to hurry on his way
 But he waved goodbye
 Saying don't you cry
 I'll be back again some day
 Thumpety thump thump
 
 Thumpety thump thump
 Look at Frosty go
 Thumpety thump thump
 Thumpety thump thump
 Over the hills of snow
 
 Frankie, dear, your birthday gift reveals to me
 That at heart you`re really not so bad.
 If I add, why our funny face appeals to me.
 Please dont` think I`ve suddenly gone mad.
 You have all the qualities of Peter Pan;
 I`d go far before I`d find a sweeter pan
 And yet
 
 I love your funny face,
 Your sunny, funny face;
 For you`re a cutie
 With more than beauty
 You`ve got a lot
 Of personality N.T.
 A thousand laughs I`ve found
 In having you around.
 Through you`re not Gloria Swanson,
 For worlds I`d not replace
 Your sunny, funny face.
 
 Needn`t tell me that I`m not so pretty, dear,
 When my looking glass and I agree,
 In the contest at Atlantic City, dear,
 Miss America I`d never be,
 
 Truth to tell, though, you`re not such a bad lot yourself;
 As a Paul Swan, you are not so hot yourself.
 And yet.
 
 I love your funny face,
 Your sunny, funny face;
 You can`t repair it,
 So I declare it
 Is quite all right -
 
 Like Ronald Colman?
 
 So`s your ol` man!
 Yet it`s very clear,
 I`m gladwhen you are near.
 Though you`re no Handsome Harry
 
 For worlds I`d not replace
 Your sunny funny face.
 
 I love that funny face,
 That sunny, funny face;
 Thought it upsets one,
 In time, it gets one -
 
 That`s true, for you
 Have personality for two.
 Those eyes! Those nose! Those cheek!
 Won`t make a movie sheik,
 
 But though your`e not patootie,
 For worlds I`d not replace
 Your sunny, funny face.
 
 I love your funny face,
 Your sunny, funny face;
 You never bother
 About your father.
 
 Have you no shame?
 You`re just a mutt and nothing but!
 Yet when you wag your tail,
 You`ll never be for sale.
 
 Though you`re no Rin Tin Tin, dear,
 For worlds I`d not replace
 Your sunny, funny face.
 
 Love makes me treat you the way that I do
 Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
 There's nothing too good for a girl, so true
 Mama, ain't I good to you
 
 Yes, I bought you furs for Christmas
 And a diamond ring
 A big Cadillac car and everything
 Love makes me treat you the way I do
 Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
 
 Love makes me treat you the way that I do
 Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
 There's nothing too good for a boy, that's so true
 Gee, ain't I good to you
 
 Bought you some cashmeres for Christmas
 A diamond ring
 A Mark 7 car, and everything
 Love makes me treat you the way that I do
 Gee baby, ain't I good to you
 
 Love makes me treat you the way that I do
 Gee baby, ain't I good to you
 There's nothing too good for a boy that's so true
 Baby, baby, ain't I good to you
 
 Bought you some crazy sport shirts
 You had your fling
 A Mercedes Benz sport car and everything
 Love makes me treat you the way that I do
 Gee baby, ain't I good to you
 
 Get me paying taxes of what I gave to you
 Gee baby, ain't I good to you
 
 Georgia, Georgia
 The whole day through
 Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind
 
 I'm say Georgia, Georgia
 A song of you
 Comes as sweet and clear
 As moonlight through the pines
 
 Other arms reach out to me
 Other eyes smile tenderly
 Still in peaceful dreams I see
 The road leads back to you
 
 I said Georgia
 Oh Georgia, no peace I find
 Just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind
 
 Other arms reach out to me
 Other eyes smile tenderly
 Still in peaceful dreams I see
 The road leads back to you
 
 Georgia, Georgia
 No peace, no peace I find
 Just this old, sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind
 
 I said just an old sweet song
 Keeps Georgia on my mind

 Get out of town
 Before it's too late, my love

 Why wish me harm?
 Why not retire to a farm?
 And be contented to charm
 The birds off the trees
 
 Just disappear

 The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet

 And when you're near, close to me, dear
 We touch too much
 
 The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
 That darling, it's getting me down
 So on your mark, get set
 Get out of town

 Get thee behind me, Satan
 I want to resist
 But the moon is low and I can't say "no"
 Get thee behind me
 
 Get thee behind me, Satan
 I mustn't be kissed
 But the moon is low and I may let go
 Get thee behind me
 
 Someone I'm mad about
 Is waiting in the night for me
 Someone that I mustn't see
 Satan, get thee behind me
 
 He promised to wait
 But I won't appear and he may come here
 Satan, he's at my gate
 Get thee behind me
 Stay where you are
 It's too late
 
 The boys watch the girls while the girls watch the boys who watch the girls go by
 Eye to eye, they solemnly convene to make the scene
 Which is the name of the game, watch a guy watch a dame on any street in town
 Up and down and over and across, romance is boss
 
 Guys talk "girl talk", it happens everywhere
 Eyes watch girls walk with tender lovin' care
 
 It's keepin' track of the fact watching them watching back 
 That makes the world go 'round
 "What's that sound?" each time you hear a loud collective sigh
 They're making music to watch girls by
 
 Guys talk "girl talk", it happens everywhere
 Eyes watch girls walk with tender lovin' care
 
 It's keepin' track of the fact watching them watching back 
 That makes the world go 'round
 "What's that sound?" each time you hear a loud collective sigh
 They're making music to watch girls by
 
 The boys watch the girls while the girls watch the boys who watch the girls go by
 Eye to eye, they solemnly convene to make the scene
 
 I'm on the beam; I've got a flash
 On how to live in the civilization
 To make a dream come out of hash
 Give a little, get a little love
 
 A morning smile, an evening kiss
 Can be the pills for the ills of the nation
 Don't cramp your style; remember this
 Give a little, get a little love
 
 No love, no hope
 Then life's a dungeon
 So throw the sponge in
 With love there's hope
 Sing, hey, hallelujah
 
 So take a share and share the fun
 And keep the cold from this whole constellation
 It's everywhere for everyone
 Make a little, take a little
 Take a little, live a little
 Give a little, get a little love
 
 You carry on, tied in a knot
 To earn the pay that your neighbor is earning
 But when it's gone, what have you got?
 Give a little, get a little love
 
 You never think till there's a storm
 And till the real things you feel like returning
 You know that mink won't keep you warm
 Give a little, get a little love
 
 No love, no joy
 Then life's a nuisance and not worth two cents
 With love, there's joy
 Sing hey hallelujah
 
 So take a share and share the fun
 And keep the cold from this whole constellation
 It's everywhere for everyone
 Make a little, take a little
 Take a little, live a little
 Give a little, get a little love
 
 No joy, no joy
 Give a little, get a little
 Give a little, get a little
 
 Make a little, take a little 
 Live a little, give a little 
 Give a little, get a little love
 
 Old Peter Minuet had nothing to lose when he bought the isle of Manhattan
 For twenty-six dollars and a bottle of booze and they threw in the Bronx and Staten
 Pete thought that he had the best of the bargin but the poor red man just grinned,
 And he grunted "ugh!" meaning okay in his jargon for he knew poor Pete was skinned.
 We`ve tried to run the city....but the city ran away...
 And now Peter Minuet
 We can`t continue it...
 
 Broadway`s turning into Coney,
 Champagne Charlie`s drinking gin,
 Old New York is new and phony
 Give it back to the Indians!
 
 Two cents more to smoke a Lucky,
 Dodging buses keep you thin,
 Now New York is simply ducky,
 Give it back to the Indians!
 
 Take all the reds, on the boxes made for soap
 Whites on Fifth Avenue
 Blues down in Wall Street losing hope..
 Big bargain today...Chief take it away!
 
 Come you busted city slickers,
 Better take it on the chin
 Father Nick has lost his knickers
 Give it back to the Indians!
 
 Take all the reds, on the boxes made for soap
 Whites on Fifth Avenue
 Blues down in Wall Street losing hope..
 Big bargain today... Chief take it away!
 
 Come you busted city slickers,
 Better take it on the chin
 Father Nick has lost his knickers
 Give it back to the Indians!
 
 I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
 Why mess around with strife?
 I never was cut out to step and strut out
 Give me the simple life
 
 Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant
 Those things roll off my knife
 Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
 Give me the simple life
 
 A cottage small is all I'm after
 Not one that's spacious and wide
 A home that rings with joy and laughter
 And the ones you love inside
 
 Some like the high road, I like the low road
 Free from the grief and strife
 Sounds corny and seedy, but, yes, indeedy
 Give me the simple life
 
 God be with you till we meet again,
 By His counsels guide, uphold you,
 With His sheep securely fold you,
 God be with you till we meet again.
 
 Till we meet, till we meet,
 Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
 Till we meet, till we meet,
 God be with you till we meet again.
 
 God be with you till we meet again,
 'Neath His wings securely hide you,
 Daily manna still provide you,
 God be with you till we meet again.
 
 God be with you till we meet again,
 When life's perils thick confound you,
 Put His arms unfailing round you,
 God be with you till we meet again.
 
 God be with you till we meet again,
 Keep love's banner floating o'er you,
 Smite death's threat'ning wave before you,
 God be with you till we meet again.
 
 Them that's got shall have
 Them that's not shall lose
 So the Bible said and it still is news
 Mama may have, Papa may have
 But God bless the child that's got his own
 That's got his own
 
 Yes, the strong gets more
 While the weak ones fade
 Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
 Mama may have, Papa may have
 But God bless the child that's got his own
 That's got his own
 
 Money--you've got lots of friends
 Crowding 'round the door
 When you're gone, spending ends
 They don't come no more
 Rich relations give
 Crust of bread and such
 You can help yourself
 But don't take too much
 Mama may have, Papa may have
 But God bless the child that's got his own
 That's got his own
 That's got his own
 
 Mama may have, Papa may have
 But God bless the child that's got his own
 That's got his own
 He just worry 'bout nothin'
 'Cause he's got his own
 Yes, he's got his own
 
 God rest ye merry gentlemen
 Let nothing you dismay
 Remember Christ our savior
 Was born on Christmas day
 To save us all from Satan's power
 When we were gone astray
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy
 Comfort and joy
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy
 
 From God our heavenly father
 The blessed angel came
 And unto certain shepherds
 Brought tidings of the same
 How bad in Bethlehem was born
 The son of God by name
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy
 Comfort and joy
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy
 
 Now to the Lord sing praises
 All you with in this place
 And with true love and brotherhood
 Each other now embrace
 This holy tide of Christmas
 All ever that you can face
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy
 Comfort and joy
 Oh tidings of comfort and joy
 
 You go to my head
 And you linger like a haunting refrain
 And a find you swimming round in my brain
 Like the bubbles in a glass of Champagne
 
 Yes I think I'm going out of my head
 I think I'm going out of my head
 Over you, over you
 
 I want you, I need you
 I want you to want me 
 I can't think of anything but you
 
 Yes I think I'm going out of my head
 Cause I can't explain the tears that I've shed
 Over you, over you
 
 I see you each morning 
 But you just walk past me
 You don't even know that I exist
 
 Going out of my head over you
 Out of my head over you
 Out of my head
 Day and night, Night and day
 It's wrong, Wrong or right
 
 I must think of a way into your heart
 Ah, there's no other reason that we should be apart
 
 Yes I think I'm going out of my head
 I can't explain the tears that I've shed
 Over you, over you
 I see you each morning but you just walk past me
 You don't even know that I exist
 
 Going out of my head over you
 Out of my head over you
 Out of my head day and night
 Night and day it's wrong
 Wrong or right
 Going out of my head 
 Day and night, night and day
 It's wrong, wrong or right
 Going out of my head
 Going out of my head.
 
 Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
 Sunny, you smiled at me and then it eased my pain
 Now the dark days are gone and bright days are here
 My Sunny once shined so sincere, Sunny once so true
 I love you I love you
 
 Gone with the wind
 Just like a leaf that has flown away
 Gone with the wind
 My romance has blown away
 Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips
 I've had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips
 
 But now all-all is gone
 Gone is the rapture that fills my heart
 Gone with the wind
 My romance has flown apart
 
 Just like a flame
 Love burned brightly, then became
 An empty smoke ring that has gone
 Gone with the wind
 
 Gone, gone, gone with the wind
 Just like a leaf that has flown away
 Gone with the wind
 My romance has flown away
 Yesterday's kisses are still, still on my lips
 I've had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips
 
 But now all-all is gone
 Gone is the rapture that fills my heart
 Gone with the wind
 My romance has flown apart
 
 Just like a flame
 Love burned brightly, then became
 An empty smoke ring that has
 Gone with the wind
 
 Gone with the wind
 
 Good morning blues, blues how do you do
 Good morning blues, blues how do you do
 Babe, I feel alright but I come to worry you
 
 Baby, it's Christmas time and I want to see Santa Claus
 Baby, it's Christmas time and I want to see Santa Claus
 Don't show me my pretty baby, I'll break all of the laws
 
 Santa Claus, Santa Claus, listen to my plea
 Santa Claus, Santa Claus, listen to my plea
 Don't send me nothing for Christmas but my baby back to me
 
 Good morning heartache
 You old gloomy sight
 Good morning heartache
 Thought we said goodbye last night
 
 I turned and tossed until it seems you have gone
 But here you are with the dawn
 Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay
 It seems I met you
 When my love went away
 Now everyday I stop I'm saying to you
 Good morning heartache what's new
 
 Stop haunting me now
 Can't shake you no how
 Just leave me alone
 I've got those Monday blues
 Straight to Sunday blues
 
 Good morning heartache
 Here we go again
 Good morning heartache
 You're the one
 Who knows me well
 Might as well get use to you hanging around
 Good morning heartache
 Sit down
 
 Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending
 Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
 It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
 It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
 The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
 Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
 So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
 Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
 Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
 Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
 Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
 Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
 My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo
 Goodnight my love, your little Dutch dolly is yawning
 Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day
 Your doggy's fast asleep, my but he's smart

 Got to get you into my life, into my life
 Got to get you into my life, into my life
 Got to get you into my life, into my life
 Got to get you into my life, into my life
 Got to get you into my life, into my life
 
 I was alone, I took a ride
 I didn't know what I would find there
 Another road where maybe
 I could see another sign there
 Oh, then I suddenly see you
 Oh, and did I tell you I need you
 Every single day of my life?
 
 You didn't run, you didn't lie
 You know I want to hold you
 And had you gone, you knew in time
 We'd meet again, for I had told you
 Oh, you were meant to be near me
 Oh, I really want for you to hear me
 Say we'll be together every day
 
 Got to get you into my life
 Got to get you in, got to get you into my life
 Got to get you into my life
 Got to get you into my life
 
 Oh, then I suddenly see you
 Oh, and did I tell you that I need you
 Every single day of my life?
 
 Got to get you into my life
 Got to get you in, got to get you into my life
 Got to get you into my life
 Got to get you into my life
 
 Got to get you in, got to get you in
 Got to get you in, got to get you in
 Into my life
 Got to get you into my life
 
 If you ain't wrong, you're right
 If it ain't day, it's night
 If you ain't sure, you might
 Gotta be this or that
 
 If it ain't dry, it's wet
 If you ain't got, you get
 If it ain't gross, it's net
 Gotta be this or that
 
 If it ain't sis, you can't miss
 It's got to be your brother
 Can't you see it's gotta be
 One way or the other?
 
 If it ain't full, it's blank
 If you don't spend, you bank
 If it ain't Dee, it's Frank
 Gotta be this or that
 
 Got a pebble in my shoe, ouch
 Got a pebble in my shoe, ouch
 Got a pebble in my shoe, ouch
 I gotta keep dancing all the time
 
 How'd it ever get in my little toesy?
 Never thought a pebble could be so nosy
 Gotta shake it out of my little hosey
 Gotta keep dancing all the time
 
 Now it's going to my heel
 Maybe I got socks appeal
 I know how a floogy feels
 
 Got a pebble in my shoe, ouch
 Got a pebble in my shoe, ouch
 Only one thing I can do, oh
 I gotta keep dancing all the time
 
 Got a pebble in my shoe, ouch
 Got a pebble in my shoe, ouch
 Got a pebble in my shoe, ouch
 And you gotta keep dancin' all the time
 
 How'd it ever get in my little toesy?
 Never thought a pebble could be so nosy
 Got a pebble in my shoe, ouch
 And you gotta keep dancing all the time
 
 Though you've decided that our love is wrong
 And think that we should part
 It seems as though I have loved you so long
 You'll always be in my heart
 
 Is it a sin
 Is it a crime
 Loving you dear like I do
 If it's a crime then I'm guilty
 Guilty of loving you
 
 Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
 Dreaming the lonely night through
 If it's a crime then I'm guilty
 Guilty of dreaming of you
 
 What can I do
 What can I say
 After I've taken the blame?
 You say we're through
 You'll go your way
 But I'll always feel just the same
 
 Maybe I'm right
 Maybe I'm wrong
 Loving you dear like I do
 If it's a crime then I'm guilty
 Guilty of loving you
 
 I've been blue all day
 My man's gone away
 He left his mama cold
 For another gal, I'm told
 
 I've tried to treat him kind
 I thought he would be mine
 That man I hate to lose
 That's why mama's got the blues
 
 The man that I love he has left me in this town
 The man I love has gone and left me in this town
 And if it keeps on snowin' I will be Gulf Coast bound
 
 Mailman passed but he didn't leave no news
 The mailman's passed but he didn't leave no news
 I tell the world he left me cryin' those Gulf Coast blues
 
 These men up north honey sure do make me tired
 These men up north they surely do make me tired
 They've got a mouth full of gimme, and a handful of much obliged
 
 
 If I am fancy free
 And love to wander
 It's just the Gypsy in my soul
 
 There's something calling me
 From way out yonder
 It's just the Gypsy in my soul
 
 I've got to give vent to my emotions
 I'm only content havin' my way
 
 There is no other life
 Of which I'm fonder
 It's just the Gypsy in my soul
 
 No cares
 No strings
 My heart has wings
 
 If I am fancy free
 And I love to wander
 It's just the Gypsy in my soul
 
 I've got to give vent to my emotions
 I'm only content havin' my way
 
 There is no other life
 Of which I'm fonder
 It's just the Gypsy in my soul
 
 No cares
 No strings
 My heart has wings
 
 If I am fancy free
 And love to wander
 It's just the Gypsy in my soul
 It's just the Gypsy in my soul
 Just the Gypsy in my soul
 
 Sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
 And you'll shoo the blues away
 Cares pursue ya, Hallelujah!
 Gets you through the darkest day
 
 Satan lies a-waitin'
 And creatin' skies of gray
 But Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
 Helps to shoo the clouds away
 
 I recall in times when I was small
 In light and free Jubilee days
 In that sunny land of milk and honey
 I had no complaints while I thought of saints
 So I say to all who fearful are
 
 Sing Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
 And you'll shoo the blues away
 When cares pursue ya, Hallelujah!
 Gets you through the darkest day
 
 Satan lies a-waitin'
 And creatin' skies of gray
 But Hallelujah, Hallelujah!
 Helps to shoo the clouds away
 
 Up at dawn and hit the deck
 Put out your chest and straighten your neck
 Gotta be clean without a speck
 Tonight the admiral's comin' to check
 
 Here this! Here that!
 Shine your shoes and square your hat
 They'll give 'ya the boot if 'ya don't salute
 Hup one two!
 
 Satan lies a-waitin'
 And creatin' skies of gray
 But Hallelujah, sing Hallelujah!
 Helps to shoo the clouds away
 
 Sing Hallelujah!
 
 Let me tell you 'bout a boy I know
 He is my baby and he lives next door
 Every morning before the sun comes up
 He brings my coffee in my favorite cup
 That's why I know, yes, I know
 Hallelujah, I just love him so
 
 When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
 I know he'll go with me until the end
 Everybody asks me how I know
 I smile and tell them he told me so
 That's why I know, yes, I know
 Hallelujah, I just love him so
 
 Now if I call him on the telephone
 And tell him that I'm all alone
 By the time I count from one to four
 I hear him on my door
 In the evening when the sun goes down
 When there is nobody else around
 He kisses me and he holds me tight
 He tells me "baby, everything's all all right"
 That's why I know, yes, I know
 Hallelujah, I just love him so
 
 It seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe
 He got a smile that make the lilac want to grow
 He got a way that make the angels heave a sigh
 When they know little Joe's passing by
 
 Sometime the cabin gloomy and the table bare
 Soon he kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere
 Trouble fly away and life is easy go
 
 Does he love me good? That's all I has to know
 Seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe
 Seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe
 Little Joe, little Joe, little Joe
 
 We want to leave you happy
 Don't want to leave you sad
 We want to leave you happy
 Don't want to leave you sad
 Want to sing some blues
 But don't want to sing them bad
 
 Roy wailed for you
 He wailed the blues tonight
 Roy wailed for you
 He wailed the blues tonight
 He wailed, he wailed, he wailed 'em just right
 
 He talked about a mean woman
 Oh what a woman was she
 Talked about a mean woman
 What a woman was she
 I've got my chance to talk about a man
 I'll talk about he
 
 He was good to me
 He was good
 He was good to me
 Whoa, so good
 I don't know much about the blues
 But I know somewhere
 
 There's a little bit of soul in Ella
 There's a little bit of soul in me
 There's a little bit of soul in Ella
 There's a little bit of soul in me
 Oh somewhere down the line
 I've had misery
 
 Every woman gets misery
 Every woman is crying
 Every woman has misery
 Every woman is crying
 Crying 'bout a man
 And the way he did her wrong
 
 I had one too
 I had one too
 I had one too
 I had one too
 He did me wrong, but what did I do
 I picked up and took patoot
 
 Yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah
 Yeah, yeah
 I want to go out swinging
 Swinging the blues tonight
 
 Don't want to talk about Mack The Knife
 Don't want to talk about the snuffing
 Just want to have fun talking about
 Things that make you happy
 Snappy happy happy snappy, that's me
 
 Joe Williams sang the blues tune
 He talked about his woman

 With this happy music
 This happy music
 
 So I'd better leave while I'm happy
 And say good night to you
 Goodnight
 Goodnight
 Goodnight
 Goodnight
 Goodnight
 
 Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,
 Talk about things you'd like to do.
 You got to have a dream,
 If you don't have a dream,
 How you gonna have a dream come true?
 
 Talk about the moon floatin' in the sky
 Lookin' at a lily on the lake;
 Talk about a bird learnin' how to fly.
 Makin' all the music he can make.
 
 Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,
 Talk about things you'd like to do.
 You got to have a dream,
 If you don't have a dream,
 How you gonna have a dream come true?
 
 Talk about the sparrow lookin' like a toy
 Pickin' through the broaches of a tree;
 Talk about the girl, talk about the boy
 Countin' all the ripples on the sea.
 
 Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,
 Talk about things you'd like to do.
 You got to have a dream,
 If you don't have a dream
 How you gonna have a dream come true?
 
 Talk about the boy sayin' to the girl:
 "Golly, baby, I'm a lucky cause."
 Talk about the girl sayin' to the boy:
 "You an' me is lucky to be us!"
 
 Happy talk, keep talkin' happy talk,
 Talk about things you'd like to do.
 You got to have a dream,
 If you don't have a dream
 How you gonna have a dream come true?
 
 If you don't talk happy,
 And you never have dream,
 Then you'll never have a dream come true!
 
 In old Savannah, I said Savannah
 The weather there is nice and warm
 The climate's of a Southern brand
 But here's what I don't understand
 
 They got a gal there, a pretty gal there
 Who's colder than an arctic storm
 Got a heart just like a stone
 Even ice men leave her alone
 
 They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
 The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
 Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
 She's a gal who loves to see men suffer
 
 To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
 Is her delight, they say; I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
 There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man
 She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA
 
 They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
 The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
 Talk of your cold, refrigerating mamas
 Brother, she's the polar bear's pajamas
 
 To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
 Is her delight; they say an evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
 Is like traveling through Alaska in your B-V-D's
 She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA
 
 Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
 She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah
 Anytime a woman can take a great big pan
 Start pouring water on a drowning man
 She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA
 
 Oh, she's sweet as sour milk
 
 In old Savannah

 Hark the herald angels sing
 "Glory to the newborn King!
 Peace on earth and mercy mild
 God and sinners reconciled"
 Joyful, all ye nations rise
 Join the triumph of the skies
 With the angelic host proclaim:
 "Christ is born in Bethlehem"
 Hark! The herald angels sing
 "Glory to the newborn King!"
 
 Christ by highest Heav'n adored
 Christ the everlasting Lord!
 Late in time behold Him come
 Offspring of a Virgin's womb
 Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
 Hail the incarnate Deity
 Pleased as man with man to dwell
 Jesus, our Emmanuel
 Hark! The herald angels sing
 "Glory to the newborn King!"
 
 Hail the Heav'n-born Prince of Peace!
 Hail the Son of Righteousness!
 Light and life to all He brings
 Ris'n with healing in His wings
 Mild He lays His glory by
 Born that man no more may die
 Born to raise the sons of earth
 Born to give them second birth
 Hark! The herald angels sing
 "Glory to the newborn King!"
 
 It happened
 I felt it happened
 I was awake
 I wasn't blind
 I didn't think
 I felt it happened
 Now I believe in matter over mind.
 And now you see we mustn't wait
 The nearest moment that we marry is too late!
 Have you met Miss Jones
 Someone said as we shook hands
 She was just Miss Jones to me
 Then I said Miss Jones
 You're a girl who understand
 I'm a boy who must be free.
 And all at once I lost my breath
 And all at once was scared to death
 And all at once I hold the eatrh and sky!
 Now I met Miss Jones
 And we'll keep on meeting till we die
 Miss Jones and I
 
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
 Let your heart be light
 From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
 
 Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
 Make the yule-tide gay,
 From now on, our troubles will be miles away
 
 Here were are as in olden days,
 Happy golden days of yore.
 Faithful friends who are dear to us
 Gather near to us once more.
 
 Through the years we all will be together
 If the fates allow
 Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
 And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
 
 There's a sunny little funny little melody
 That was started by a native down in Waikiki
 He would gather a crowd down beside the sea
 And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
 Soon the other little natives started singin' it
 And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
 Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit
 Funny little gay Hawaiian Chant
 Ow way tah tualan Me big bad fightin' man
 Tho it started on an island down Hawaii way
 It's as popular in Tennessee or Ioway
 If you wander into any cabaret
 You will hear this gay Hawaiian Chant
 
 He loves and she loves
 And they love
 So why can't you love
 And I love like too?
 Birds love and bees love
 And whispering trees love
 And that's what we both should do
 
 Oh, I always knew someday you'd come along
 We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong
 Hear me? He loves and she loves
 And they love, so won't you
 Love me as I love you?
 
 Oh, I always knew someday you'd come along
 We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong
 Hear me? He loves and she loves
 And they love, so won't you
 Love me as I love you?
 Won't you love me as I love you?
 
 He's a carioca
 He's a carioca
 Just see the way he walks
 Nobody else can be
 What he is to me
 I look, and what do I see
 When I look deep in his eyes?
 I can see the sea
 A forgotten road
 The caressing skies
 And not only that I'm in love
 With him
 The most exciting way
 It's written on my lips
 Where his kisses stay
 He smiles and all of a sudden
 The world is smiling for me
 And you know what else
 He's a carioca
 He's a carioca
 
 He's a carioca
 He's a carioca
 Just see the way he walks
 Nobody else can be
 What he is to me

 A forgotten road
 The caressing skies
 And not only that I'm in love
 With him
 The most exciting way
 It's written on my lips
 Where his kisses stay
 He smiles and all of a sudden
 The world is smiling for me
 And you know what else
 He's a carioca
 He's a carioca
 
 Here he comes
 Here he comes
 Here he comes
 Here he comes
 
 He's my guy
 I don't care what he does
 Cause he's my guy
 I guess he always was
 He careless about me
 I don't think he tries
 But once in a while 
 he'll hug me and smile
 Then I can see me in his eyes
 
 Oh he's my guy
 I know he'll always be
 And I will try
 To keep him loving me
 However he wants me
 I'm his until I die
 For nobody knows better than I
 That he's my guy
 
 Oh he's my guy
 I know he'll always be
 And I will try
 To keep him loving me
 However he wants me
 I'm his until I die
 For nobody knows better than I
 That he's my guy
 
 Ramblin' man makes no change in me
 I'm going to ramble back to my used-to-be
 Aww, you hear me talkin' to ya
 I don't bite my tongue
 You wanna be my man?
 You gotta fetch it with you when you come
 
 Eve and Adam in a garden takin' a chance
 Adam didn't take time to get his pants
 Aww, you hear me talkin' to ya
 I don't bite my tongue
 You wanna be my man?
 You gotta fetch it with ya when you come
 
 I don't care whether they're old or young
 When the chips were down, they have trouble along
 I guess you hear me talkin' to ya
 I don't bite my tongue
 You wanna be my man?
 You gotta fetch it with ya when you come
 
 Hello sayin' true give me 6 0 9
 What takes gettin' in these
 His or mine?
 Hear me talkin' to ya
 I don't bite my tongue
 You wanna be my man?
 You gotta fetch it with you when you come
 
 Heart and soul
 I fell in love with you heart and soul
 Because you held me tight
 And stole a kiss in the night
 
 Heart and soul
 I begged to be adored
 I lost control and tumbled overboard gladly
 That magic night we kissed
 There in the moon mist
 Oh, but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling
 Never before were mine so faintly willing
 But now I see what one embrace can do
 That little kiss you stole
 Held all my heart and soul
 
 Now I see what one embrace can do
 Look at me; it's got me loving you madly
 That little kiss you stole
 Held all my heart and soul
 
 I can't believe you really love me
 That I can call the sun to shine
 I'm so afraid there'll be
 Another after me
 Heart of mine
 And yet when I receive your letter
 I'm reassured by every line
 I hope they still hold true
 For me there's only you
 Heart of mine
 Are you on the level?
 Do you tell me lies?
 I'm between the devil
 And your deep blue haunting eyes
 I love you so I hate to lose you
 To me you're something really fine
 Don't ever change of heart
 Say we'll never part
 Heart of mine
 
 We're having a heat wave,
 A tropical heat wave,
 The temperature's rising,
 It isn't surprising,
 She certainly can can-can.
 
 She started a heat wave
 By letting her seat wave
 In such a way that
 The customers say that
 She certainly can can-can.
 
 Gee, her anatomy
 Makes the mercury
 Jump to ninety-three.
 
 We're having a heat wave,
 A tropical heat wave,
 The way that she moves
 That thermometer proves
 That she certainly can can-can.
 
 I said hello, Dolly, 
 Well, hello, Dolly
 It's so nice to have you back where you belong
 You're lookin' swell, Dolly
 I can tell, Dolly
 You're still glowin'
 You're still crowin'
 You're still goin' strong
 I feel that room swayin'
 While the band's playin'
 One of your old favourite songs from way back when
 So take her wrap, fellas
 Find her an empty lap, fellas
 Dolly'll never go away again

 Hello Ma! I done it again
 I got the funniest yen
 And before I knew it
 I was in somebody's arms
 
 Y'know, ma, how gentlemen are
 He took me out in his car
 And before I knew it
 We were surrounded by farms
 
 Then we spoke of the drought
 And we chatted about his old uncle Ben
 Then he asked for a kiss
 And I gave him a kiss and then, then
 
 Hello Ma! I done it again
 I got the funniest yen
 And before I knew it my heart said do it
 And I fell in love again
 
 When I think of Tom
 I think about a night
 When the earth smelled of Summer
 And the sky was streaked with white
 And the soft mist of England
 Was sleeping on a hill
 
 I remember this
 And I always will
 There are new lovers now
 On the same silent hill
 Looking on the same blue sea
 And I know Tom and I
 Are a part of them all
 And they're all a part of Tom and me
 
 Hello, Young lovers, whoever you are
 I hope your troubles are few
 All my good wishes go with you tonight
 I've been in love like you
 
 Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
 Be brave and faithful and true
 Cling very close to each other tonight
 I've been in love like you
 
 I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
 And to fly down a street in a trance
 You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
 And you meet not really by chance
 
 Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do
 Don't cry because I'm alone
 All of my memories happy tonight
 I've had a love of my own
 I've had a love of my own like yours
 I've had a love of my own
 
 PETER
 
 Here come de honey man.
 Yes man, dis de honey man.
 You got honey in de comb?
 Yes man, I got honey in de comb.
 An' is yo honey cheap?
 Yes mam, my honey very cheap.
 Here come de honey man.
 
 ALL
 Hello, Peter.
 
 LILY
 Well, here come my ol' man.
 
 Now gimme the money! Now go sit and rest.
 
 Here in my arms it's adorable!
 It's deplorable
 That you were never there.
 
 When little lips are so kissable
 It's permissible
 For me to ask my share.
 
 Next to my heart it is ever so lonely.
 I'm holding only air.
 
 While here in my arms it's adorable!
 It's deplorable
 That you were never there.
 
 I should have saved
 Those leftover dreams
 Funny
 But here's that rainy day
 Here's that rainy day
 They told me about
 And I laughed at the thought
 That it might turn out this way
 Where is that worn out wish
 That I threw aside
 After it brought my love so near
 Funny how love becomes
 A cold rainy day
 Funny
 That rainy day is here
 It's funny
 How love becomes
 A cold rainy day
 Funny
 That rainy day is here
 
 I know a dark, secluded place
 A place where no one knows your face!
 A glass of wine, a fast embrace
 It's called Hernando's Hideaway, a-way!
 
 All you see are silhouettes
 And all you hear are castanets
 And no one cares how late it gets
 Not at Hernando's hideaway, a-way!
 
 At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go
 You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know
 But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of
 You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love
 Just knock three times and whisper low
 That you and I were sent by Joe
 Then strike and match and you will know
 You're in Hernando's hideaway, a-way!
 
 I know a dark, secluded place
 A place where no one ever knows your face!
 Wine is fine with a fast embrace
 Hernando's Hideaway -away!
 
 At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go
 You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know
 But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of
 You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love
 Just knock three times and whisper low
 That you and I were sent by Joe
 Then strike and match and you will know
 You're in Hernando's hideaway!
 
 Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
 Take a sad song and make it better
 Remember to let her into your heart
 Then you can start to make it better
 
 Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
 You were made to go out and get her
 The minute you let her under your skin
 Then you begin to make it better
 
 And anytime you feel the pain, hey, Jude, refrain
 Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
 For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
 By making his world a little colder
 
 Hey, Jude, don't let me down
 You have found her; now go and get her
 Remember to let her into your heart
 Then you can start to make it better
 
 So let it out and let it in; hey, Jude, begin
 You're waiting for someone to perform with
 And don't you know that it's just you; hey, Jude, you'll do
 The movement you need is on your shoulder
 
 Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
 Take a sad song and make it better
 Remember to let her under your skin
 Then you'll begin to make it
 Better, better, better, better, better, better, oh
 
 Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, hey, Jude
 
 Music music everywhere
 Happiness is in the air
 Not a soul has got a care
 Holiday in Harlem
 
 Up and down the avenue
 You see faces old and new
 With a smile that welcomes you
 'Cause it's holiday in Harlem
 
 Sophisticated ladies
 Dizzy, dumb, and wise
 My oh my, when they get high
 There's danger in their eyes
 
 Not a soul is feelin' blue
 Up and down the avenue
 With a smile that welcomes you
 Holiday in Harlem
 
 Sophisticated ladies
 Dizzy, dumb, and wise
 My oh my, when they get high
 There's danger in their eyes
 
 Not a soul is feelin' blue
 Up and down the avenue
 With a smile that welcomes you
 'Cause it's holiday in Harlem
 
 Every honey bee fills with jealousy
 When they see you out with me
 
 Goodness knows
 You're my honeysuckle rose
 
 When you're passin' by, flowers droop and sigh
 And I know the reason why
 
 Goodness knows
 You're my honeysuckle rose
 
 Don't buy sugar
 You just have to touch my cup
 You're my sugar
 It's sweeter when you stir it up
 
 When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
 Seems the honey fairly drips
 
 Goodness knows
 You're my honeysuckle rose
 
 Goodness knows
 You're my honeysuckle rose
 
 Don't buy sugar
 You just have to touch my cup
 You're my sugar
 It's sweeter when you stir it up
 
 When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
 Seems the honey fairly drips
 
 Goodness knows
 You're my honeysuckle rose
 
 It`s the wonder of the world, It`s a rocket to the moon
 It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...
 
 Here`s to my best romance, Here`s to my worst romance
 Here`s to my first romance - ages ago
 Here`s to the boys I've kissed, and to complete the list
 Here`s to the boys who said "No!"
 
 Love, love, hooray for love
 Who was ever too blase for love
 Make this the night for love
 If we have to fight, let`s fight for love
 
 Some sigh and cry for love
 Ah, but in Pa-ree they die for love
 Some waste away for love
 Just the same - hooray for love!
 
 It`s the rocket to the moon, with a touch of "Clare de Lune"
 It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...
 
 Some trust to fate for love,
 Others have to take off weight for love
 Some go berserk for love
 Loafers even go to work for love
 
 Sad songs are sobbed for love
 People have their noses bobbed for love
 Some say we pay for love
 Just the same - hooray for love!
 
 It's over, all over
 And soon somebody else will make a fuss about you
 But how about me?
 
 It's over, all over
 And soon somebody else will tell his friends about you
 But how about me?
 
 You'll find somebody new
 But what am I to do?
 I'll still remember you
 When you have forgotten
 
 And maybe, a baby
 Will climb upon your knee and put its arms about you
 But how about me?
 
 Mine was a simple story
 Never a thought of glory
 I did what I did and what I had
 I was glad to posses
 
 But you changed my whole direction
 And now that I've seen perfection
 How could I settle for less?
 
 I was the shyest lover
 Ready to run for cover
 But look at me now
 I'm not the same, I aim to impress
 
 You gave me a glance at heaven
 And given a change at heaven
 How could I settle for less?
 
 Could Caesar span Cleopatra's door?
 Columbus turn once he saw the shore?
 
 I, I don't want fame or treasure
 Miracles made to measure
 The beautiful things that people
 Rate the greatest success
 
 I only want you forever
 And you and I close together
 How could I settle for?
 How, how could I settle?
 How could I settle for less?
 
 Tell me, tell me, tell me
 Tell me daddy, how could I settle for less?
 I wanna know, I want to know
 How could I settle for?
 
 How can I tell you what is in my heart?
 How can I measure each and every part?
 How can I tell you how much I love you?
 How can I measure just how much I do?
 
 How much do I love you?
 I'll tell you no lie
 How deep is the ocean?
 How high is the sky?
 
 How many times a day do I think of you?
 How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
 
 How far would I travel
 To be where you are?
 How far is the journey
 From here to a star?
 
 And if I ever lost you
 How much would I cry?
 How deep is the ocean?
 How high is the sky?
 
 Somewhere there's music
 How faint the tune
 Somewhere there's heaven
 How high the moon
 There is no moon above
 When love is far away too
 Till it comes true
 That you love me as I love you
 
 Somewhere there's music
 It's where you are
 Somewhere there's heaven
 How near, how far
 The darkest night would shine
 If you would come to me soon
 Until you will, how still my heart
 How high the moon
 
 How high the moon
 Is the name of this song
 How high the moon
 Though the words maybe wrong
 We're singin' it because you ask for it
 So we're swingin' it just for you
 
 How high the moon
 Does it touch the stars
 How high the moon
 Does it reach out to mars
 Though the words maybe wrong to this song
 We're askin' how high high high high is the moon
 
 Though the words maybe wrong to that song
 We're askin' how high high high high is the moon
 
 How insensitive
 I must have seemed
 When she told me that he loved me
 How unmoved and cold
 I must have seemed
 When she told me so sincerely
 Why she must have asked
 Did I just turn and stare in icy silence?
 What was I to say?
 What can you say when a love affair is over?
 
 Now she's gone away
 And I'm alone with the memory of her last look
 Vague and drawn and sad
 I see it still
 All her heartbreak in that last look
 Why she must have asked
 Did I just stare in icy silence?
 What was I to do?
 What can one do when a love affair is over?
 
 'Neath the stars, at bazaars
 Often I've had to caress men
 Five or ten, dollars then, I'd collect from all those yes-men
 Don't be sad, I must add, that they meant no more than chess-men
 
 Darling, can't you see?
 'Twas for charity?
 Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
 Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?
 
 I could cry salty tears
 Where have I been all these years?
 Little wow, tell me now
 How long has this been goin' on?
 
 There were chills up my spine
 And some thrills I can't define
 Listen sweet, I repeat
 How long has this been goin' on?
 
 Oh, I feel that I could melt
 Into heaven I'm hurled
 I know how columbus felt
 Finding another world
 
 Kiss me once, then once more
 What a dunce I was before
 What a break, for heaven's sake
 How long has this been goin' on?
 
 Kiss me twice, once more, thrice, make it four
 
 What a break, for heaven's sake
 How long has this been goin' on?
 
 How long, baby how long,
 Has that evening train been gone?
 How long, how how long, baby how long?
 
 Went to the station, didn't see no train.
 Down in my heart, I have an aching pain.
 How long, how how long, baby how long?
 
 I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
 Thinking 'bout the good time that I once have had.
 How long, how how long, baby how long?
 
 I could see the green grass growing on the hill;
 I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill.
 How long, how how long, baby how long?
 
 You're gonna be sorry, you'll feel so blue.
 When you want me, baby, I declare I won't want you.
 How long, how how long, baby how long?
 
 Don't have no money for to ride the train.
 I would ride the rods, baby, to be with you again.
 How long, how how long, baby how long?
 
 How long, baby how long
 Must I keep my, my watch in pawn?
 How long, how how long, baby how long?
 
 When I want to see the boys
 I know where to find the boys
 I don't go through a club or two
 I just find you and there are the boys
 To get you alone I strive
 You ask me to tea at five
 I find you then with other men
 And wonder when my chance will arrive
 
 How's chances, say, how are the chances
 Of making you love me the way I love you
 
 How many young men must I fight with
 To be in right with
 In right with you
 
 How's chances for one of those glances
 A glimpse of the heaven I'm longing to see
 
 How's chances to end all your romances
 And start taking your chances with me
 
 My castle will need some restoring
 Ceiling and flooring
 Furniture, too
 
 I've been listening to the sounds of the night
 Waiting for you to come around and hold me tight
 I've been wanting you right here by my side
 
 I don't care what you've gotta do
 Just get here in a rush
 Every part of me aches for you
 It keeps getting stronger; I hunger, I long for you touch
 
 Hurry home
 I'm counting the minutes until you are in my arms
 Hurry home as fast as you can, baby
 I'll be here ready to hold you; don't take it slow
 Won't ya hurry home to me?
 
 I miss the way you laugh off the blues
 The way you're there to listen when I need you to
 And, baby, how I'm needing you now
 
 I know that you'll be coming soon
 It's taking way too long
 I asked the man up in the moon
 To send you to me instantly back to where you belong
 
 And when you come back, when you walk through that door
 
 Ain't got the change of a nickel
 Ain't got no bounce in my shoes
 Ain't go no fancy to tickle
 
 I ain't got nothing but the blues
 Ain't got no coffee that's perking
 Ain't got no winnings to lose
 
 Ain't got a dream that is working
 I ain't got nothing but the blues
 When trumpets flare up
 
 I keep my hair up
 I just can't make it come down
 Believe me peppie
 I can't get happy
 
 Since my ever loving baby left town
 Ain't got no rest in my slumbers
 Ain't got no feelings to bruise
 Ain't got no telephone numbers
 I ain't got nothing but the blues
 
 I am dejected, I am depressed
 Yet resurrected and sailing the crest
 Why this elation, mixed with deflation?
 What explanation, I am in love
 
 Such conflicting questions rise
 Around in my brain
 Should I order cynanide or order champagne?
 
 Oh, what is this sudden jolt?
 I feel like a frightened colt
 Just hit by a thunderbolt, I am in love
 
 I knew the odds were against me before
 I had no flair for flaming desire
 But since the gods gave me you to adore
 I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire
 
 So come and enlighten my days and never depart
 You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart
 For I am wildly in love with you
 And so in need of a stampede of love
 
 I knew the odds were against me before
 I had no flair for flaming desire
 But since the gods gave me you to adore
 I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire
 
 So come and enlighten my days and never depart
 You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart
 For I am wildly in love with you
 And so in need of a stampede of love
 And so in need of a stampede of love
 
 Bad news, go away
 Call `round someday
 In March or May
 I can't be bothered now
 
 My bonds and shares
 May fall downstairs
 Who cares, who cares
 I'm dancing and
 
 I can't be bothered now
 I'm up among the stars
 On earthly things I frown
 I'm throwing off the bars
 
 That held me down
 I'll pay the piper
 When times are riper
 Just now, I shan't
 
 Because you see I'm dancing and
 I can't be bothered now
 
 I'm up among the stars
 On earthly things I frown
 I'm throwing off the bars
 That held me down
 
 I'll pay the piper
 When times are riper
 Just now, I shan't
 Because you see I'm dancing and
 
 I can't be bothered now
 
 Yesterday you came my way,
 And when you smiled at me,
 In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
 That it was love at sight and
 I was right to love you as I do.
 Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.
 
 Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
 I never knew what they could do.
 I can't believe that you're in love with me.
 
 You're telling ev'ry one I know
 I'm on your mind each place we go
 They can't believe that you're in love with me.
 
 I have always placed you far above me.
 I just can't imagine that you love me.
 And after all is said and done,
 To think that I'm the lucky one.
 I can't believe that you're in love with me.
 
 Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
 When you are not around.
 Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
 But when you're by my side I fill with pride
 For I'm so proud of you
 It all seems too good to me to all be true
 
 Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
 I never knew what they could do.
 I can't believe that you're in love with me.
 
 You're telling ev'ry one I know
 I'm on your mind each place we go
 They can't believe that you're in love with me.
 
 I have always placed you far above me.
 I just can't imagine that you love me.
 And after all is said and done,
 To think that I'm the lucky one.
 I can't believe that you're in love with me.
 
 Breeze, stop moaning those wit melodies
 My man has left me, so I can't face the music
 Without singing the blues
 
 Rain, your rhythm on my window pane
 Drives me insane because I can't face the music
 Without singing the blues
 
 My heart is so broken
 I've spoken to the Lord for a little sympathy
 And if He don't help me, so help me
 It's the bottom of the deep blue sea for me
 
 I'm gonna end this misery; I'm almost crazy
 'Cause I can't face the music
 Without singing the blues
 
 My heart is so broken
 I've spoken to the Lord for just a little sympathy
 And if He don't help me, so help me
 Gonna jump to the bottom of the deep blue sea for me
 
 I'm going to end this misery; I'm going crazy
 'Cause I can't face the music
 Without singing the blues
 
 Tell you I'm almost crazy, baby
 'Cause I'm tired of facing these blues
 
 I've flown around the world in a plane
 I've settled revolutions in Spain
 The North Pole I have charted, but I can't get
 Started with you
 
 Around the golf course I'm under par
 And all the movies want me to star
 I've got a house, a show place, but I get no
 Place with you
 
 You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you
 Scheme, just for a sight of you
 Dream, both day and night of you
 And what good does it do?
 
 In 1929 I sold short
 In England I'm presented at court
 But you've got me downhearted, cause I can't get
 Started with you
 
 You're so supreme, lyrics I write of you
 Scheme, just for a sight of you
 Dream, both day and night of you
 And what good does it do?
 
 Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
 It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
 My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
 simply rotten to something worse
 Who knows, some day I will win too. 
 I'll begin to reach my prime.
 
 Now though I see what our end is,
 All I can spend is just my time.
 
 I can't give you anything but love, baby.
 That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.
 
 Dream awhile, scheme awhile
 We're sure to find
 
 Happiness and I guess
 All those things you've always pined for.
 
 Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
 Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.
 
 Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
 I can't give you anything but love.
 
 Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
 You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
 But I am willing to wait, dear, 
 Your little mate, dear, will not forget.
 
 You have a lifetime before you.
 I'll adore you, come what may.
 
 Please don't be blue for the present, 
 When it's so pleasant to hear you say
 
 I can't give you anything but love, baby.
 That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.
 
 Dream awhile, scheme awhile
 We're sure to find
 
 Happiness and I guess

 Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
 I can't give you anything but love.
 
 So you're leaving 
 In the morning 
 On the early train 
 I could say everything's alright 
 I could pretend and say good bye 
 
 Got your ticket 
 Got your suitcase 
 Got your leaving smile 
 
 I could say that's the way it goes 
 I could pretend and you won't know 
 That I was lying 
 'Cause I can't stop loving you 
 I can't stop loving you 
 No, I can't stop loving you 
 
 Though I try 
 Took a taxi 
 To the station 
 Not a word was said 
 I saw you walk across the road 
 Maybe the last time, I don't know 
 
 Feeling humble 
 I heard a rumble 
 On the railway track 
 And when I hear the whistle blow 
 I walk away and you don't know 
 
 That I was lying 
 'Cause I can't stop loving you 
 No, I can't stop loving you 
 I can't stop loving you 
 Though I try 
 
 'Cause I can't stop loving you 
 I can't stop loving you 
 No, I can't stop loving you 
 Though I try
 
 Whenever skies look grey to me
 And trouble begins to brew
 Whenever the winter winds
 Become too strong
 I concentrate on you
 
 When fortune cries nay, nay to me
 And people declare "you're through"
 Whenever the blues become my only song
 I concentrate on you
 
 On your smile, so sweet, so tender
 When at first, your kiss I decline
 On the love in your eyes when I surrender
 And once again, our arms intertwine
 
 And so, when wise men say to me
 That love's young dreams never come true
 To prove that even wise men can be wrong
 I concentrate on you
 
 I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
 And still have begged for more
 I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
 I've never done before
 
 I'll never know what made it so exciting
 Why all at once my heart took flight
 I only know when he began to dance with me
 I could have danced, danced, danced all night
 
 I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
 And still have begged for more, more, more
 I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
 I've never done before
 
 I'll never know what made it so, so exciting
 Why all at once my heart took flight
 I only know when he began to dance with me
 I could have danced, danced, danced all night

 I never learned to spell,
 At least not well.

 I never learned to count,
 A great amount.
 
 But my busy mind is burning to use what learning I`ve got,
 I won`t waste any time,
 I`ll strike while the iron is hot.
 
 If they asked me, I could write a book
 About the way you walk, and whisper, and look.
 I could write a preface
 On how we met
 So the world would never forget.
 
 And the simple secret of the plot
 Is just to tell them that I love you a lot.
 And the world discovers
 As my book ends,
 How to make two lovers
 Of friends.

 Away from the city that hurts and knocks
 I'm standing alone by the desolate docks
 In the still and the chill of the night
 I see the horizon, the great unknown
 
 My heart has an ache
 It's as heavy as stone
 With the dawn coming on; make it last
 
 I cover the waterfront
 I'm watching the sea
 Will the one I love
 Be coming back to me?
 
 I cover the waterfront
 In search of my love 
 And I'm covered
 By a starlit-sky above
 
 Here am I
 Patiently waiting
 Hoping and longing
 Oh, how I yearn
 Where are you?
 Have you thought back time?
 Will you remember?
 Will you return?
 
 Will the one I love
 Be coming back
 To me?
 
 I remember other days how I used to weep 
 Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
 You forgot your promises, every single vow
 All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
 I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 Every road has a turning
 That's one thing you're learning
 I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
 Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
 I found a heart just a little bit truer
 I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
 How can I forget the hours that I worried through
 Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
 In those days you never thought anything of me
 But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
 I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 Every road has a turning
 That's one thing you're learning
 I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
 Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
 I found a heart just a little bit truer
 I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
 I ran around, with my own little crowd
 The usual laughs, not often, but loud
 And in the world that I knew
 I didn't know about you
 
 Chasing after the ring, on the merry-go-round
 Just taking my fun, where it could be found
 And yet what else could I do
 I didn't know about you
 
 Darling, now I know
 I had the loneliest yesterday, everyday
 In your arms
 I know for once in my life, I'm living
 
 Had a good time, every time I went out
 Romance was a thing, I kidded about
 How could I know about love
 I didn't know about you
 
 Darling, now I know
 I had the loneliest yesterday, everyday
 In your arms
 I know for once in my life, I'm living
 
 Had a good time, every time I went out
 Romance was a thing, I kidded about
 How could I know about love
 I didn't know about you
 
 I didn't know about you
 
 Once I was young --
 Yesterday, perhaps --
 Danced with Jim and Paul
 And kissed some other chaps.
 
 Once I was young,
 But never was naive.
 I thought I had a trick or two
 Up my imaginary sleeve.
 
 And now I know I was naive.
 I didn't know what time it was
 Then I met you.
 Oh, what a lovely time it was,
 
 How sublime it was too!
 I didn't know what day it was
 You held my hand.
 Warm like the month of May it was,
 
 And I'll say it was grand.
 Grand to be alive, to be young,
 To be mad, to be yours alone!
 Grand to see your face, feel your touch,
 
 Hear your voice say I'm all your own.
 I didn't know what year it was
 Life was no prize.
 I wanted love and here it was
 
 Shining out of your eyes.
 I'm wise,
 And I know what time it is now.
 Grand to be alive, to be young,
 
 To be mad, to be yours alone!
 Grand to see your face, feel your touch,
 Hear your voice say I'm all your own.
 I didn't know what year it was
 
 Life was no prize.
 I wanted love and here it was
 Shining out of your eyes.
 I'm wise,
 
 And I know what time it is now.
 
 I didn't mean a word I said
 And if I hurt you I'm sorry
 I didn't mean to lose my head
 And if made you cry I'm sorry
 It was just another foolish quarrel
 Won't you end it with a kiss and 
 Just remember this
 Except the time I said I love you
 I didn't mean a word I said
 I didn't mean a word I said
 
 I didn't mean a word I said
 And if I hurt you I'm so so sorry so so so sorry
 I didn't mean to lose my head
 And if made you cry I'm sorry
 It was just another foolish quarrel
 Won't you end it with a kiss and 
 Just remember this
 Except the time I said I love you
 I didn't mean a word I said
 I didn't mean a word I said
 
 I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
 But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
 I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
 And "I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!"
 If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
 You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
 And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
 I know I must be dreaming
 
 I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
 My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
 And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
 I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
 My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
 And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
 A-tisket, a-tasket
 A green and yellow basket
 I send a letter to my mommy
 On the way I dropped it
 
 I dropped it, I dropped it
 Yes, on the way I dropped it
 A little girlie picked it up
 And took put it in her pocket
 
 She was truckin' on down the avenue
 Without a single thing to do
 She went peck, peck, peckin' all around
 When she spied it on the ground
 
 She took it, she took it
 She took my yellow basket
 And if she doesn't bring it back
 I think that I would die
 
 A-tisket, a-tasket
 A green and yellow basket
 And if that girlie don't return it
 Don't know what I'll do
 
 Oh dear, I wonder where my basket can be
 Oh gee, I wish that little girl I could see
 Oh, why was I so careless with that basket of mine
 That itty-bitty basket was a joy of mine
 
 A-tisket, a-tasket
 I lost my yellow basket
 Won't someone help me find my basket
 And make me happy again
 
  no no no no
  no no no no
  no no no no
 Just a little yellow basket
 
 A little yellow basket
 
 My story is much too sad to be told
 But practically everything leaves me totally cold
 The only exception I know is the case
 When I'm out on a quiet spree
 Fighting vainly the old ennui
 And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face
 
 I get no kick from champagne
 Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
 So tell me, why should it be true
 That I get a kick out of you?
 Some get a kick from cocaine
 I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
 That would bore me terrifically too
 But I get a kick out of you
 
 I get a kick every time I see
 You're standing there before me
 I get a kick though it's clear to me
 You obviously don't adore me
 I get no kick in a plane
 Flying too high with some guy in the sky
 Is my idea of nothing to do
 Yet I get a kick out of you
 
 I get a kick every time I see
 You standing there before me
 I get a kick though it's clear to me
 You obviously don't adore me
 I get no kick in a plane
 Flying too high with some guy in the sky
 Is my idea of nothing to do
 Yet I get a kick out of you
 
 I get a kick out of you
 
 I got a guy
 He don't dress me in sable
 He looks nothing like Gable
 But he's mine
 And I think he's too divine
 
 I got a guy
 When he starts into pet me
 He's the sauce on spaghetti
 He's the kind
 That you can't keep off your mind
 
 I got a guy
 And he's tough
 He's just a gem in the rough
 But when I polish him up, I swear
 He'll be a Tiffany solitaire
 
 I'm riding high
 'Cause I'm happy and carefree
 There is nothing that can scare me
 'Cause I got a guy
 
 I got a guy
 And he's tough
 He's just a gem in the rough
 But when I polish him up, I swear
 He'll be a Tiffany solitaire
 
 I'm riding high
 'Cause I'm happy and carefree
 There is nothing that can scare me
 'Cause I got a guy
 
 The poets say that all who love are blind
 But I'm in love and I know what time it is
 The good book says, "Go seek and ye shall find"
 Well, I have sought and my, what a climb it is!
 
 My life is just like the weather
 It changes with the hours
 When he's near I'm fair and warmer
 When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers
 
 An emotion like the ocean
 It's either sink or swim
 When a woman loves a man
 Like I love him
 
 Never treats me sweet and gentle, the way he should
 I got it bad and that ain't good
 My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood
 I got it bad and that ain't good
 
 But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around
 I end up like I started out just cryin' my lil' heart out
 He don't love me like I love him
 No, nobody could, I got it bad and that ain't good
 
 So bad, so bad
 
 I got on it so bad, so bad though folks with good intentions
 Tell me to save my tears
 I'm glad, I'm mad about you, I can't live without you
 Lord above me make him love me the way he should
 
 Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
 The things I tell my pillow
 No woman should
 I got it bad, bad so bad and that ain't good
 
 I got plenty of nothing
 And nothing's plenty for me
 I got no car - got no mule
 I got no misery
 
 Folks with plenty of plenty
 They've got a lock on the door
 Afraid somebody's gonna rob 'em
 While there out  making more - what for
 
 I got no lock on the door - that's no way to be
 They can steal the rug from the floor - that's OK with me
 'Cause the things that I prize - like the stars in the skies - are all free
 I got plenty of nothing
 
 And nothing's plenty for me
 I got my gal - got my song
  Got heaven the whole day long
 - Got my gal - got my love - got my song
 
 Days can be sunny with never a sigh
 Don't need what money can buy
 Birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs
 Why shouldn't we sing along
 I'm chipper all the day
 Happy with my lot
 How do I get that way
 Look at what I've got
 
 I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man
 Who could ask for anything more
 I've got daisies in green pastures
 I've got my man
 Who could ask for anything more
 
 Old man trouble I don't mind him
 You won't find him 'round my door
 I've got starlight
 I've got sweet dreams
 I've got my man
 Who could ask for anything more
 
 Ba ba da da da ah
 
 Old man trouble, I don't mind him
 You won't find him 'round my door
 I've got starlight
 I've got sweet dreams
 I've got my man
 Who could ask for anything more
 
 I've got rhythm, I've got music
 I've got daisies in green pastures
 I've got starlight
 I've got sweet dreams
 I've got my man
 Who could ask for anything more
 
 
 I gotta right to sing the blues
 I gotta right to feel low-down
 I gotta right to hang around
 Down around the river
 A certain gal in this old town
 Keeps draggin' my poor  heart around
 All I see, for me is - misery
 I gotta right to sing the blues
 I gotta right to moan and sigh
 I gotta right to sit and cry
 Down around the river
 I know the deep blue sea
 Will soon be callin' me
 It must be love - say what you choose
 I gotta right to sing the blues
 
 I hadn't anyone till you, I was a lonely one till you
 I used to lie awake and wonder, if there could be
 A someone in this wide world, just made for me
 And now I see I had to save my love for you
 
 I never gave my love till you
 And through my lonely heart demanding it, 
 Cupid took a hand in it
 I hadn't anyone till you
 And through my lonely heart demanding it, 
 Cupid took a hand in it
 I hadn't anyone till you
 
 I hear music, mighty fine music
 The murmur of a morning breeze up there
 The rattle of the milkman on the stair
 
 Sure that's music, mighty fine music
 The singing of a sparrow in the sky
 The perking of the coffee right nearby
 
 That's my favorite melody
 You, my angel, phoning me
 
 I hear music, mighty fine music
 And anytime I think my world is wrong
 I get me out of bed and sing this song
 
 That's my favorite melody
 You, my angel, phoning me
 
 I hear music, mighty fine music
 And anytime I think my world is wrong
 I get me out of bed and sing this crazy song
 
 I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
 'Bout your plans to make me blue
 With some other guy you knew before 
 Between the two of us guys 
 You know I loved you more
 It took me by surprise I must say 
 When I found out yesterday 
 Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
 Not much longer would you be mine
 Oh I heard it through the grapevine
 Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
 
 Honey, honey yeah.
 I heard it through the grapevine 
 Not much longer would you be mine baby
 
 I know a man ain't supposed to cry 
 But these tears I can't hold inside
 Losin' you would end my life you see
 'Cause you mean that much to me
 You could have told me yourself 
 That you loved some one else
 Instead I heard it through the grapevine
 Not much longer would you be mine
 Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
 And I'm just about to lose my mind
 
 Honey, honey yeah
 I heard it through the grapevine 
 Not much longer would you be mine, baby
 
 People say believe half of what you see
 Son and none of what you hear
 But I can't help but be confused
 If it's true please tell me dear
 Do you plan to let me go
 For the other guy you loved before?
 
 Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine 
 Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah
 I heard it through the grapevine 
 I'm just about to love my mind
 Honey, honey, yeah
 I heard it through the grapevine,
 Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah
 
 I let a song go out of my heart
 It was the sweetest melody
 I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song
 
 Since you and I have drifted apart
 Life doesn't mean a thing to me
 Please come back, sweet music, I know I was wrong
 
 Am I too late to make amends?
 You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends
 
 I let a song go out of my heart
 Believe me, darlin', when I say
 I won't know sweet music until you return some day
 
 I let a song go out of my heart
 Believe me, darlin', when I say
 I won't know sweet music until you return some day
 
 
 I love the East, I love the West
 And North and South they're both the best
 But I only want to go there as a guest
 'Cause I love being here with you
 
 I love the sea, I love the shore
 I love the rocks and what is more
 With you there, they'd never be a bore
 'Cause I love being here with you
 
 Singing in the shower, laughing by the hour
 Life is such a breezy game
 Love all kinds of weather 'long as we're together
 I love to hear you say my name
 
 I love good wine and fine cuisine
 And candle light; I like the scene
 But, baby, if you know what I mean
 I love being here with you
 I love being here with you
 
 I like a dance by Fred Astaire
 And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair
 But I think to tell you's only fair
 That I love being here with you
 
 And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day
 His utter charm takes me away
 But don't get me wrong, how do you say
 I love being here with you
 
 Basie's band a-swinging, I like Ella's singing
 Because there's something else, you know
 They know how to say it, they know how to play it
 They wind it up and let it go
 
 I love the thrill of New York shows
 I'd love to kiss Durante's nose
 But I'd like to say before I close
 That I love, and is love, I love being here with you
 
 Every time I look down on this timeless town
 Whether blue or gray be her skies
 Whether loud be her cheers or whether soft be her tears
 More and more do I realize that
 
 I love Paris in the springtime
 I love Paris in the fall
 I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles
 I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles
 
 I love Paris every moment
 Every moment of the year
 I love Paris
 Why, oh, why do I love Paris?
 Because my love is near
 
 I love Paris in the springtime
 I love Paris in the fall
 I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles
 I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles
 
 I love Paris every moment
 Every moment of the year
 I love Paris
 Why, oh, why do I love Paris?
 Because my love is near
 
 I loves you, Porgy
 Don't let him take me
 Don't let him handle me
 And drive me mad
 If you can keep me
 I wanna stay here with you forever
 And I'll be glad
 
 Yes, I loves you, Porgy
 Don't let him take me
 Don't let him handle me
 With his hot hands
 If you can keep me
 I wants to stay here with you forever
 I've got my man
 
 I loves you, Porgy
 Don't let him take me
 Don't let him handle me
 And drive me mad
 If you can keep me
 I wanna stay here with you forever
 I've got my man
 
 Someday I know he's coming to call me
 He's going to handle me and hold me
 So, it's going to be like dying, Porgy
 When he calls me
 But when he comes, I know I'll have to go
 
 I loves you, Porgy
 Don't let him take me
 Honey, don't let him handle me
 And drive me mad
 If you can keep me
 I wanna stay here with you forever
 I've got my man
 
 I may be wrong, but I think you're wonderful
 I may be wrong, but I think you're swell
 I like your style; say, I think it's marvelous
 I'm always wrong, so how can I tell?
 
 Deuces to me are all aces
 Life is to me just a bore
 Faces are all open spaces
 You might be John Barrymore
 
 You came along; say, I think you're wonderful
 I think you're grand, but I may be wrong
 
 I may be wrong, but I think you're wonderful
 I may be wrong, but I think you're swell
 I like your style; say, I really think it's marvelous
 I'm always wrong, so how can I tell?
 
 Deuces to me are all aces
 Life is to me just a bore
 Faces are all open spaces
 You might be John Barrymore
 
 You came along; say, I think you're wonderful
 I think you're grand, but I may be wrong
 
 You said that Edison would never make that light
 You laughed at Mr. Franklin with his key and light
 The point of the song is I'm always wrong
 But with you, baby, I'm oh-so right
 
 Don't want my mammy
 I don't need a friend
 My heart is broken, it won't ever mend
 I ain't much carin' 
 Just where I will end
 I must have that man
 
 I'm like an oven
 That's cryin' for heat
 He treats me awful
 Each time we meet
 It's just unlawful
 How that boy can cheat
 But I must have that man
 
 He's hot as Hades
 A lady's not safe in his arms when she's kissed
 But I'm afraid that when he's cooled off
 And maybe I'm ruled off his list
 I'll never be missed
 I need that person much worse 'n just bad
 I'm half alive 'n he's drivin' me mad
 He's only human if he's to be had
 I must have that man
 
 I must have that man
 
 guess there's nothing to do
 And nothing to say,
 But simply go on my way
 And call it a day.
 
 I guess I'm ready to go
 Right back on the shelf,
 Because at last I've learned
 Where you're concerned,
 I've just been fooling myself.
 
 I never had a chance,
 I thought you cared for me,
 But now I see I never had a chance.
 I never had a chance.
 Though you never told me so,
 Somehow I know I never had a chance.
 
 I knew we'd have to part,
 For I could always reach your lips
 But I could never reach your heart.
 My dream about romance
 Ended in a friendly chat.
 But more than that,
 I never had a chance.
 
 I never had a chance,
 I thought you cared for me,
 But now I see I never had a chance.
 I never had a chance.
 Though you never told me so,
 Somehow I know I never had a chance.
 
 I knew we'd have to part,
 For I could always reach your lips
 But I could never reach your heart.
 My dream about romance
 Ended in a friendly chat.
 But more than that,
 I never had a chance.
 
 Are the stars out tonight? 
 I don't know if it's cloudy or bright 
 'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear 
 The moon may be high 
 But I can't see a thing in the sky 
 'Cause I only have eyes for you.
 
 I don't know if we're in a garden 
 Or on a crowded avenue 
 You are here, so am I 
 Maybe millions of people go by 
 But they all disappear from view 
 And I only have eyes for you
 I don't know if we're in a garden 
 Or on a crowded avenue 
 You are here, so am I 
 Maybe millions of people go by 
 But they all disappear from view 
 And I only have eyes for you.
 
 Was it in Tahiti,were we on the Nile
 Long long ago say an hour ago
 I recall that I saw your smile
 I remember you-ooh
 You're the one who made my dreams come true
 A few kisses ago
 
 I remember you-ooh
 You're the one who said "I love you, too"
 Yes, I do, didn't ya know?
 
 I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
 Like the rain out of the blue
 
 When my life is through
 And the angels ask me to recall
 The thrill of it all
 Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh
 
 I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
 Just like the rain out of the blue
 
 When my life is through
 And the angels ask me to recall
 The thrill of it all
 Then I will tell them I remember, tell them I remember
 Tell them I remember you
 
 Well, Lordy I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 Just like a tree that's growin' in the meadow 
 I shall not be moved
 
 I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
 On my way to glory land I will not be moved
 I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 Just like a tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 Just like a tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 Well, I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
 On my way to glory land I shall not be moved
 I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 Oh well
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 I shall not be, I shall not be moved
 Just like a tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 On this rock of ages I shall not be moved
 On this rock of ages I shall not be moved
 Just like a tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 Glory, glory, glory, Hallelujah, I shall not be moved
 Glory, Hallelujah, I shall not be moved
 Just like a tree that's planted by the water
 I shall not be moved
 
 I should care, I should go around weeping
 I should care, I should go without sleeping
 Strangely enough, I sleep well
 'Cept for a dream or two
 But then I count my sheep well
 Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep
 
 So I should care, I should let it upset me
 I should care, but it just doesn't get me
 Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
 But I should care and I do
 
 I should care, but it just doesn't get me
 Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
 But I should care and I do
 And I do
 
 I took a trip on a train, and I thought about you
 I passed a shadowy lane, and I thought about you
 Two or three cars parked under the stars, a windin' stream
 Moon shining down on some little town
 And with each beam, the same old dream
 And every stop that we made, oh I thought about you
 And when I pulled down the shade, then I really felt blue
 I peaked through the crack and looked at the track
 The one goin' back to you, and what did I do?
 I thought about you
 
 There were two or three cars parked under the stars, a windin' stream
 Moon shining down on some little town
 And with each beam, the same old dream
 
 And then I peaked through the crack and I looked at that track
 The one goin' back to you, and what did I do?
 I thought about you
 
 Strange
 How a dreary world can suddenly change
 To a world as bright as the evening star
 Queer
 What a difference when your vision is clear
 And you see things as they really are
 
 I used to be color-blind
 But I met you and now I find
 There's green in the grass
 There's gold in the moon
 There's blue in the skies
 
 That semi-circle that was always hanging about
 Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
 And you brought the colors out
 
 Believe me it's really true
 Till I met you I never knew
 A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies
 
 I never knew there were such lovely colors
 And the big surprise
 Is the red in your cheeks
 The gold in your hair
 The blue in your eyes
 
 I want a little girl to love a lot
 I'd give her everything that I've got
 For a little girl who'd fall in love with me
 
 I want a little girl; she may not look
 Like the kind in a picture book
 But if she can cook, she'll suit me to a T
 
 She don't have to wave her hair
 Or dress in fancy clothes
 And I wouldn't even care if she don't wear silken hose
 
 I want a little girl to call my own
 There must be someone that's all alone
 Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me
 
 Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me
 Just a little girl who'd suit me to a T
 
 She don't have to wave her hair
 Or dress in fancy clothes
 And I wouldn't even care if she don't wear silken hose
 
 I need a little girl, that certain kind
 The kind you read about but never find
 Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me
 Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me
 
 I want the waiter
 With the water
 I want the waiter with the water for my daughter
 I want the waiter with the water for my daughter
 Cause my daughter has an order for some water on
 
 The tray
 He's got a menu
 That'll send you
 He's got a menu that'll send you and befriend you
 He's got a menu that'll send you and befriend you
 Maybe lend you if you help me find the waiter
 
 With the tray
 While my daughter was having lunch one day
 She caught the waiter's eye
 He took one look at her, then ran away
 Now she's bothered by her thirst unless I find
 
 That guy
 I want the waiter
 With the water
 I want the waiter with the water for my daughter
 Don't want the butcher or the baker or the
 Candlestickle maker
 Want the waiter with the water on the tray
 
 She wants the waiter
 With the water
 She wants the waiter with the water for her
 Daughter
 Don't want the butcher or the baker or the
 Candlestickle maker
 Want the waiter - with the water on the tray
 
 I want to be happy
 But I won't be happy
 Till I make you happy, too
 
 Life's really worth living
 When we are mirth-giving
 Why can't I give some to you?
 
 When skies are gray
 And you say you are blue
 I'll send the sun smiling through
 
 I want to be happy
 But I won't be happy
 Till I make you happy, too
 
 Don't tell me about a night in June
 Or a shady lane beneath the velvet moon
 Don't tell me, 'cause I want to talk about you.
 
 Don't mention that waterfall
 Or that shady nook where crickets softly call
 Don't tell me, 'cause I want to talk about you.
 
 The moon and the stars, the objects on Mars
 Are things that we've talked of before
 But your love for me was the question
 Your answer throws back heaven's door, so
 
 Tell me, your love will be sincere,
 Then my darling, you needn't ever fear
 I love you and I want to talk about you.

 I wants to stay here,
 But I ain`t worthy.
 You is too decent to understan`.
 For when I see him he hypnotize me.
 When he take hold of me with his hot hand.
 Someday I know he`s coming back to call me.
 He`s goin` to handle me an` hold me so.
 It`s goin` to be like dyin`, Porgy, deep inside me -
 But when he calls, I know I have to go.
 
 If dere warn`t no Crown, Bess, if dere was only jus` you an`
 Porgy, what den?
 
 I loves you, Porgy,
 Don` let him take me,
 Don` let him handle me an` drive me mad.
 If you kin keep me,
 I wants to stay here wid you forever,
 An` I`d be glad.
 
 There, there, Bess, you don` need to be afraid no mo`,
 You`s picked up happiness and laid yo` worries down.
 You goin` to live easy, you goin` to live high.
 You goin` to outshine every woman in dis town.
 An` remember, when Crown come that`s my business, Bess!
 
 I loves you, Porgy,
 Don` let him take me
 Don` let him handle me
 With his hot han`
 If you kin keep me
 I wants to stay here wid you forever.
 I got my man.
 
 What you think I is, anyway,
 To let dat dirty houn` dog steal my woman?
 If you wants to stay wid Porgy, you goin` stay.
 You got a home now, Honey, an` you got love.
 So no mo` cryin`, can`t you understan`?
 You goin` to go about yo` business, singin` `cause
 You got Porgy, you got a man.
 
 I was doing all right
 Nothing but rainbows in my sky
 I was doing all right
 Till you came by.
 
 Had no cause to complain
 Life was as sweet as apple pie
 Never noticed the rain
 Till you came by.
 
 But now whenever you`re away
 Can`t sleep nights and suffer all the day
 I just sit and wonder
 If love isn`t one big blunder.
 
 But when you hold me tight
 Tingling all through, I feel somehow
 I was doing all right
 But I`m doing better than ever now.
 
 But now whenever you`re away
 Can`t sleep nights and suffer all the day
 I just sit and wonder
 If love isn`t one big blunder.
 
 But when you hold me tight
 Tinglin` all through, I feel somehow
 I was doing all right
 But I`m doing better
 Better than ever now.
 
 The sleepless nights, the daily fights
 The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
 I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
 I wish I were in love again
 
 The broken dates, the endless waits
 The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
 The conversation, with the flying plates
 I wish I were in love again
 
 No more pain, no more strain
 Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk
 
 The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
 The fine mismating, of a him and her
 I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
 In love again
 
 The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
 The words: "I love you, 'til the day I day"
 The self deception, that believes the lie
 I wish I were in love again
 
 When love congeals, it soon reveals
 The faint aroma, of performing seals
 The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
 I wish I were in love again
 
 No, no more care, no, no despair
 Now I'm all there , but I'd rather be punk drunk
 
 Believe me sir, I much prefer
 The classic battle, of a him and her
 I don't like quiet, and I wish I were
 In love again, in love again, in love again
 
 I wished on the moon
 For something I never knew
 Wished on the moon
 For more than I ever knew
 A sweeter rose, a softer sky
 On April days that would not dance by
 I begged on the stars
 To throw me a beam or two
 Wished on the stars
 And asked for a dream or two
 I looked for every loveliness
 It all came true
 I wished on the moon for you
 
 Think of what you're losing
 By constantly refusing to dance with me
 You'd be the idol of France with me
 And yet you stand there
 And shake your foolish head dramatically
 While I wait here so ecstatically
 You just look and say emphatically
 
 Not this season, yes that's the reason
 I won't dance, don't ask me
 I won't dance, don't ask me
 I won't dance, madam, with you
 My heart won't let my feet
 Do things they should do
 
 You know what, you're lovely
 And so what, you're still lovely
 But oh, what you do to me
 I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
 I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
 
 Yes, when you dance you're charming and you're gentle
 Especially when you do the continental
 But this feeling isn't purely mental
 For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos
 
 And that's why
 I won't dance, why should I
 I won't dance, how could I
 I won't dance, merci beaucoup
 I know that music leads the way to romance
 So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance
 
 I won't dance, don't ask me
 I won't dance, don't ask me
 I won't dance, monsieur, with you
 My heart won't let my feet
 Do things they should do
 
 You know what, you're handsome
 And so what, you're handsome
 But oh, what you do to me
 I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
 I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
 
 When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
 Especially when you do the continental
 But this feeling isn't purely mental
 For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos
 
 And that's why
 I won't dance, why should I
 I won't dance, how could I
 I won't dance, merci beaucoup
 I know that music leads the way to romance
 So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance
 
 I won't dance, don't ask me
 I won't dance, don't ask me
 I will not dance, madame, with you
 Yes, my heart won't let my feet do things they should do
 
 You know what, you're kinda lovely
 And so what, I'm lovely
 But oh, what you do to me
 I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
 I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
 
 When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
 Especially when you do the continental
 But this feeling isn't purely mental
 For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos, honey
 
 And that's why
 I won't dance, why should I
 I won't dance, how could I
 I won't dance, merci beaucoup
 I know that music leads the way to romance
 So if I hold you in my arms, I won't dance
 
 Sweetheart, if you should stray a million miles away
 I'll always be in love with you
 Although you find more fish in someone else's dish
 I'll always be in love with you
 
 I can't do any more; I tried so hard to please
 But let me thank you for those tender memories
 
 I wish you happiness; as for me, sweetheart, I guess
 I'll always be in love with you
 
 Now we'll say till something do us part
 That old dad of mine ain't got a heart
 Any girl who's out for pleasure
 Thinks of marriage only at her leisure
 As it is, they've got the horse behind the cart
 
 When my pop said we must wed,
 He kind of wowed me, still I'm read-y
 But one thing must be clear
 At this time
 
 I'll be hard to handle
 I promise you that
 And if you complain
 Here's one little Jane
 Who'll leave you flat
 
 I'll be hard to handle
 What else can I be
 I say with a shrug
 I think you're a mug
 To marry me
 
 When you first threw me a gander
 I was willing to philander
 But I never thought I'd have to be a bride
 Now you're gonna find tough sledding
 I don't want no shotgun wedding
 I was only along for the ride
 
 I'll be hard to handle
 I'm telling you plain
 Just be a dear
 And scram out of here
 I'm gonna raise cain
 
 I'll be hard to handle
 My bridges are burned
 This wedding's a gag
 And you're in the bag
 Where I'm concerned
 
 I'll be hard to handle
 When we've said, "I do"
 See there's no hope
 I just got a dope
 When I took you
 
 I'll be living my life in bed
 But they always will be twin beds
 And I warn you, you'll be living like a monk
 Our affair is now a past one
 So don't think you've pulled a fast one
 Just remember, I think you're a punk!
 
 I'll be hard to handle
 I'm no ball and chain
 I'll find some means
 To call the Marines
 I'm gonna raise cain
 
 Gonna raise cain
 I'm telling you plain
 I'm gonna raise cain
 
 
 Heaven sends 
 A song through its doors 
 Just as if it seems to know 
 I'm exclusively yours 
 Knowing this 
 I feel but one way 
 You will understand too 
 In these words that I say 
 I'll close my eyes 
 To everyone but you 
 And when I do 
 I'll see you standing there 
 I'll lock my heart 
 To any other caress 
 I'll never say yes 
 To a new love affair 
 Then I'll close my eyes 
 To everything that's gay 
 If you are not there 
 Oh, to share each lovely day 
 And through the years 
 In those moments 
 When we're far apart 
 Don't you know I'll close my eyes 
 And I'll see you with my heart
 
 Each time I hold somebody new
 My arms go cold thinking of you
 No one can take your place, darling, in my embrace
 I'll never be free
 
 And when my lips burn with desire
 No other kiss can put out the fire
 Though I may try and try, no one can satisfy
 This longing in me
 
 I'll never be free from your smile so tender
 The sweet surrender in your eyes
 How can I be free when I still remember?
 How you could thrill me with a sigh
 Just like a chain bound to my heart
 Your love remains while we're apart
 
 Each kiss I gave to you
 Made me a slave to you
 I'll never be free
 
 That kiss I gave to you
 Made me a slave to you
 I'll never be free
 
 I'll never be the same
 Stars have lost their meaning for me
 I'll never be the same
 Nothing's what it once use to be
 And when the songbirds that sing
 Tell me it's spring 
 I can't believe their song
 Once love was king but kings can be wrong
 I'll never be the same
 There is such an ache in my heart
 Never be the same since we're apart
 Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
 I know down deep inside
 I'll never be the same never be the same again
 
 I'll never be the same
 Stars have lost their meaning for me
 I'll never be the same
 Nothing's what it once use to be
 And when the songbirds that sing
 Tell me it's spring 
 I can't believe their song
 Once love was king but kings can be wrong
 I'll never be the same
 There is such an ache in my heart
 Never be the same since we're apart
 Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
 I know down deep inside
 
 What do you get when you fall in love?
 A guy with a pin to burst your bubble
 That's what you get for all your trouble
 I'll never fall in love again
 
 What do you get when you kiss a guy?
 You get enough germs to catch pneumonia
 After you do, he'll never phone you
 I'll never fall in love again
 
 Don't tell me what it's all about
 'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
 Out of those chains, those chains that bind you
 That is why I'm here to remind you
 
 What do you get when you need a guy?
 You get enough tears to feel an ocean
 That's what you get for your devotion
 I'll never fall in love again
 
 Don't tell me what it's all about
 'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out
 Out of those chains, those chains that bind you
 That is why I'm here to remind you
 
 What do you get when you fall in love?
 Nothing but pain, lies, and sorrow
 So for at least until tomorrow
 I'll never fall in love again
 
 This lovely day will lengthen into evening
 We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
 Alone where we have walked together
 I'll remember April and be glad
 
 I'll be content you loved me once in April
 Your lips were warm, and love and spring were new
 I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
 For I'll remember April and you
 
 The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
 For flames live such a little while
 I won't forget, but I won't be lonely
 I'll remember April and smile
 
 I'll see you in my dreams
 And then I'll hold you in my dreams
 Someone took you right out of my arms
 Still I feel the thrill of your charms
 
 Lips that once were mine
 Tender eyes that shine
 They will light my way tonight
 I'll see you in my dreams
 
 Yes, I will see you in my dreams
 You know I'll hold you in my dreams
 I know that someone took you right out of my arms
 But, still, I feel the thrill of your charms
 
 I dream of lips that once were mine
 And those tender eyes that shine
 I know they'll light my way tonight
 When I see you in my dreams
 
 Yes, they will light my way tonight
 Because I'll see you in my dreams
 
 I never cared much for moonlit skies
 I never wink back at fireflies
 But now that the stars are in your eyes
 I'm beginning to see the light
 I never went in for afterglow
 Or candlelight on the mistletoe
 But now when you turn the lamp down low
 
 I'm beginning to see the light
 Used to ramble through the park
 Shadowboxing in the dark
 Then you came and caused a spark
 That's a four-alarm fire now
 I never made love by lantern-shine
 I never saw rainbows in my wine
 But now that your lips are burning mine
 I'm beginning to see the light
 
 I'm confessin' that I love you,
 Tell me, do you love me too?
 I'm confessin' that I need you,
 Honest I do, need you every moment.
 In your eyes I read such strange things,
 But your lips deny they're true,
 Will your answer really change things
 Making me blue?
 
 I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,
 Saying "can't we still be friends"
 If you go, you know you'll grieve me,
 All in life on you depends.
 Am I guessin' that you love me,
 Dreaming dreams of you in vain,
 I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.
 
 Never thought I'd fall, but when I hear you call
 I'm getting sentimental over you
 Things you say and do just thrill me through and through
 I'm getting sentimental over you
 
 I thought I was happy I could live without love
 Now, I must admit, love is all I'm thinking of
 Won't you please be kind, and just make up your mind
 That you'll be sweet and gentle; be gentle with me
 'Cause I'm getting sentimental over you
 
 In this world of ordinary people
 Extraordinary people, I'm glad there is you
 
 In this world of over-rated pleasures
 Of under-rated treasures, I'm glad there is you
 
 I live to love, I love to live with you beside me
 This role so new, I'll muddle through with you to guide me
 
 In this world where many, many play at love
 And hardly any stay in love, I'm glad there is you
 More than ever, I'm glad there is you
 
 In this world where many, many play at love
 And hardly any stay in love, I'm glad there is you
 More than ever, I'm glad there is you
 
 Woke up this morning wanting to cry
 Then I remember, yes, I know why
 She's a real good one for having her cake
 I'm gonna go fishing or jump in the lake
 
 Yeah, I'm gonna go fishing, that's what I'll do
 Think about nothing, not even you
 Catch a real big one, a big speckled trout
 Snapping in the water, I'll pull him on out
 
 Sweet talking liar, spin me a yarn
 Tell me a story, big as a barn
 Don't stop listening, I won't hear you out
 I'm gonna go fishing and catch me a trout
 
 If a gal is a liar, a gal is a fool
 Playing for keepers and breaking the rules
 She'll be the loser, yet to find out
 I'm gonna go fishing and catch me a trout
 
 Here in the water, look at him shine
 There goes a big one, that one is mine
 Catch up the reel now, I've got the feel now
 Hooked onto my fly rod, I've got me a trout
 
 Sweet talking liar, you're in for a fall
 You tell me a story, you cut to the wall
 Don't go my way, I'm down the highway
 I'm gonna go fishing
 
 Yes, I'm gonna go fishing
 Yes, I'm gonna go fishing and get me some trout
 
 I'm gonna sit right down
 And write myself a letter
 And make believe it came from you
 I'm gonna write words oh-so sweet
 They're gonna knock me off of my feet
 A lot of kisses on the bottom
 I'll be glad I got 'em
 
 I'm gonna smile and say
 I hope you're feeling better
 And close with love, the way that you do
 I'm gonna sit right down
 And write myself a letter
 And make believe it came from you
 
 I'm gonna sit right down
 And write myself a letter
 And make believe that it came from you
 I'm gonna write words oh-so sweet, yeah
 
 Lotta kisses on the bottom
 I'll be glad I got 'em
 I'm gonna smile and say
 I hope you're feeling better
 And close with love, the way that you do
 
 I'm gonna sit right down
 And write myself a letter
 And make believe it came from you
 
 I'm gonna sit right down
 And write myself a letter
 And make believe it came
 Make believe that it came from you
 
 I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
 I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
 I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
 And send him on his way
 
 I'm gonna wave that man right outta my arms
 I'm gonna wave that man right outta my arms
 I'm gonna wave that man right outta my arms
 And send him on his way
 
 Don't try to patch it up
 Tear it up, tear it up
 Wash him out, dry him out
 Push him out, fly him out
 Cancel him and let him go
 Yea, sister
 
 I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
 I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
 I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair
 And send him on his way
 
 If a man don't understand you
 If you fly on separate beams
 Waste no time, make a change
 Ride that man right off your range
 Rub him out of the roll call
 And drum him out of your dreams
 
 Oho, if you laugh at different comics
 If you root for different teams
 Waste no time, weep no more
 Show him what the door is for
 Rub him out of the roll call
 And drum him out of your dreams
 
 You can't light a fire when the woods are wet
 No
 You can't make a butterfly strong
 Hmm, hmm
 You can't fix an egg when it ain't quite good
 And you can't fix a man when he's wrong
 You can't put back a petal when it falls from a flower
 Or sweeten up a fellow when he starts turnin' sour
 Oh no, oh no
 
 If his eyes get dull and fishy
 When you look for glints and gleams
 Waste no time
 Make a switch
 Drop him in the nearest ditch
 Rub him out of the roll call
 And drum him out of your dreams
 Oho, oho
 
 I went to wash that man right outta my hair
 I went to wash that man right outta my hair
 I went to wash that man right outta my hair
 And sent him on his way
 
 She went to wash that man right outta my hair
 She went to wash that man right outta my hair
 She went to wash that man right outta my hair
 And send him on his way
 
 I'm in the mood for love
 Simply because you're near me.
 Funny, but when you're near me
 I'm in the mood for love.
 
 Heaven is in your eyes
 Bright as the stars we're under
 Oh! Is it any wonder
 I'm in the mood for love?
 
 Why stop to think of whether
 This little dream might fade?
 We've put our hearts together
 Now we are one, I'm not afraid!
 
 If there's a cloud above
 If it should rain we'll let it
 But for tonight, forget it!
 I'm in the mood for love
 
 As I walk down the street
 Seems everyone I meet
 Gives me a friendly hello
 I guess I'm just a lucky so and so
 
 The birds in every tree
 Are all so neighborly
 They sing wherever I go
 I guess I'm just a lucky so and so
 
 If you should ask me the amount
 In my bank account
 I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'
 But that don't worry me, confidentially
 I've got a dream that's a pippin'
 
 And when the day is through
 Each night I hurry to
 A home where love waits, I know
 I guess I'm just a lucky so and so
 
 And when the day is through
 Each night I hurry to
 A home where love waits, I know
 I guess I'm just a lucky so and so
 I'm just a lucky, lucky so and so
 
 I'm making believe that you're in my arms though I know you're so far away
 Making believe I'm talking to you, wish you could hear what I say
 And here in the gloom of my lonely room we're dancing like we used to do
 Making believe is just another way of dreaming, so till my dreams come true
 
 I'll whisper "Good night", turn out the light, and kiss my pillow
 Making believe it's you
 I'm making believe that you're in my arms though I know you're so far away
 Making believe I'm talkin' to you, wish you could hear what I say
 
 And here in the gloom of my lonely room we're dancing like we used to do
 Making believe is just another way of dreamin', so till my dreams come true
 I'll whisper "Good night", turn out the light, and kiss my pillow
 Making believe it's you
 
 And here in the gloom of my lonely room we're dancing like we used to do
 Making believe is just another way of dreamin', so till my dreams come true
 I'll whisper "Good night", turn out the light, and kiss my pillow
 Making believe it's you
 
 I am not such a clever one
 About the latest fads
 I admit I was never one
 Adored by local lads
 Not that I ever try to be a saint
 I'm the type that they classify as quaint
 I'm old fashioned
 I love the moonlight
 I love the old fashioned things
 The sound of rain
 Upon a window pane
 The starry song that April sings
 This year's fancies
 Are passing fancies
 But sighing sighs holding hands
 These my heart understands
 I know I'm old fashioned
 But I don't mind it
 That's how I want to be
 As long as you agree
 To stay old fashioned with me
 
 I'm old fashioned
 But I don't mind it
 That's how I want to be
 As long as you agree
 To stay old fashioned with me
 Oh won't you stay old fashioned with me
 Oh please stay old fashioned with me
 
 
 I'm the lonesomest gal in town
 Everybody has thrown me down
 I got no angel child to ever call me "dear"
 Got no honey man for me to cuddle near
 
 But I'm learnin' to roll my eyes
 And someday you may be surprised
 When I steal someone's lovin' man
 And kiss him with a smack
 
 I'll hug him and I'll squeeze him
 But I'll never give him back
 'Cause I'm lonesome, so very lonesome
 I'm the lonesomest gal in this here town
 
 If you read in the papers some day
 That some poor girl has passed away
 Don't shed a tear if you should hear
 That gal was me and if you see
 
 My picture in the paper with a smile on my face
 I was broken-hearted that smile was out of place
 If you wanna save a gal from her grave
 Find me a man if you can
 
 I'm the lonesomest gal in town
 Everybody is throwin' me down
 I got no angel child to ever call me "dear"
 Got no honey man for me to cuddle near
 
 But I'm learnin'; I'm gonna roll my eyes
 And someday you're gonna be surprised
 When I steal someone's lovin' man
 And kiss him with a smack
 
 I'll hug him and I'll squeeze him
 But I'll never give him back
 'Cause I'm lonesome, so very lonesome
 I'm the lonesomest gal in this or any other town
 
 I'm thru with love,
 I'll never fall again.
 Said I do to love,
 Don't ever call again.
 For I must have you
 Or no one.
 That's why I'm thru with love.
 
 I've locked my heart.
 I keep my feelings there.
 I have stopped my heart
 Like an icy frigidaire.
 For I need to care for no one.
 That's why I'm thru with love.
 
 Why did you leave me
 To think that you cared.
 You didn't need me.
 You have your share
 of slaves around you
 To hound you and swear
 Their deep devotion.
 Emotion.
 
 Did you good by the spring 
 And all it meant to me
 a good neighbor 
 The things that used to be.
 For I must have you or no one.
 That's why I'm thru with love.
 That's why I'm thru with love.
 
 I'm walkin', yes indeed, and I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
 I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me 
 I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin' for your company
 I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
 What 'ya gonna do when the well runs dry?
 You're gonna run away and hide
 I'm gonna run right by your side, for you pretty baby I'll even die
 I'm walkin', yes indeed, I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
 I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
 
 I'm walkin', yes indeed, and I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
 I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me 
 I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin' for your company
 I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
 What 'ya gonna do when the well runs dry?
 You're gonna sit right down and cry  
 What 'ya gonna do when I say "bye-bye"? 
 All you're gonna do is dry your eye
 I'm walkin', yes indeed, I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
 
 How glad the many millions
 Of Timothy's and William's
 Would be, to capture me
 But you had such persistence
 You wore down my resistance
 I fell, and it was swell
 You're my big and brave and handsome Romeo
 How I won you I shall never, never know
 It's not that you're attractive
 But oh, my heart grew active
 When you came into view
 
 I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
 All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
 I never had the least notion
 That I could fall with such emotion
 Could you coo, could you care
 For a cunning cottage we could share
 The world will pardon my mush
 'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
 
 Could you coo, could you care
 For a cunning cottage we could share
 The world will pardon my mush
 'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on you
 
 Now I'm flyin' high, but I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
 Fallin' for nobody else but you
 Mama, you caught my eye and I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
 Show me the ring and I'll jump right through
 
 I used to travel single-o; we chanced to mingle-o
 Now I'm a-tingle over you
 Hey, Mister Parson, stand by, but I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
 Fallin' for nobody else but you
 
 Mister Shylock was stingy
 I was miserly too.
 I was more selfish
 And crabby than a shellfish.
 Oh, dear, it's queer
 What love can do!
 
 I'd give all my possessions
 For you
 I've got five dollars
 I'm in good conditions
 And I've got ambition
 That belongs to you.
 Six shirts and collars
 Debts beyond endurance
 On my life insurance
 That belongs to you!
 
 I've got a heart
 That must be spurtin'!
 
 Just be certain
 I'll be true
 Take my five dollars!
 Take my shirt and collars!
 Take my heart and hollers!
 "Ev'rything I've got belongs to you!"
 
 I've got five dollars
 Eighty-five relations
 Two lace combination's
 They belongs to you!
 Two coats with collars
 Ma and Grandma wore'em
 All the moths adore 'em
 They belongs to you!
 
 I've got two lips
 That care for mating
 Therefore waiting
 Will not do!
 Take my five dollars!
 Take my shirt and collars!
 Take my heart and hollers!
 "Everything I've got belongs to you!"
 
 
 I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
 Got the string around my finger
 What a world, what a life, I'm in love!
 I've got a song that I sing
 
 I can make the rain go, anytime I move my finger
 Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love
 Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string
 I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go
 
 I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
 Got the string around my finger
 What a world, what a life, I'm in love
 
 Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string
 I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go
 I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
 Got the string around my finger
 What a world
 Man this is the life 
 And now I'm so in love!
 
 I've got you under my skin
 I've got you deep in the heart of me
 So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me
 I've got you under my skin
 
 I'd tried so not to give in
 I said to myself this affair never will go so well
 But why should I try to resist when, darling, I know so well
 I've got you under my skin
 
 I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
 For the sake of having you near
 In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
 And repeats and repeats in my ear
 Don't you know little fool
 You never can win
 Use your mentality, wake up to reality
 But each time that I do just the thought of you makes me stop
 Before I begin
 'Cause I've got you under my skin
 
 I would sacrifice anything come what might
 For the sake of having you near
 In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
 And repeats how it yells in my ear
 Don't you know, little fool
 You never can win
 Use your mentality, wke up to reality
 But each time I do just the thought of you makes me stop
 Before I begin
 'Cause I've got you under my skin
 I've got you under my skin
 
 I've got your number
 I know you inside out
 You ain't no Eagle Scout
 You're all at sea
 
 Oh yes, you brag a lot
 Wave your own flag a lot
 But you're unsure a lot
 You're a lot like me, oh
 
 I've got your number
 And what you're looking for
 And what you're looking for
 Just suits me fine
 
 We'll break the rules a lot
 We'll be damn fools a lot
 But then why should we not
 How could we not combine when
 
 I've got your number
 And I've got the glow you've got
 I've got your number
 And more
 
 So go ahead and pick a number
 From one to ten
 You're losing streak is over
 I can't win again
 And here's the punchline
 You've got mine
 
 Whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong
 Whether I find a place in this world or never belong
 I've gotta be me, I've gotta be me
 What else can I be but what I am?
 
 I want to live, not merely survive
 And I won't give up this dream
 Of life that keeps me alive
 I've gotta be me, I've gotta be me
 The dream that I see makes me what I am
 
 That far-away prize, a world of success
 Is waiting for me if I heed the call
 I won't settle down, won't settle for less
 As long as there's a chance that I can have it all
 
 I'll go it alone--that's how it must be
 I can't be right for somebody else
 If I'm not right for me
 I've gotta be free, I've gotta be free
 Daring to try, to do it or die
 I've gotta be me
 
 I'll go it alone--that's how it must be
 I can't be right for somebody else
 If I'm not right for me
 I've gotta be free, I've just gotta be free
 Daring to try, to do it or die
 I've gotta be me
 
 I've grown accustomed to his face
 He almost makes the day begin
 I've grown accustomed
 To the tune that he whistles night and noon
 
 His smiles, his frowns
 His ups, his downs
 Are second nature to me now
 Like breathing out and breathing in
 
 I was serenely independent
 And content before we met
 Surely I could always be that way again
 And yet I've grown accustomed to his look
 
 Accustomed to his voice
 Accustomed to his face
 I'm so used to hearing him say
 "Good morning" every day
 
 His joys, his woes
 His highs, his lows
 Are second nature to me now
 Like breathing out and breathing in
 
 I'm very grateful he's a man and so easy to forget
 Rather like a habit one can always break
 And yet I've grown accustomed
 To the trace of something in the air
 
 Accustomed to his face
 
 If anything happened to you
 I would lose every reason to live
 There's no thrill that life could give
 If anything happened to you
 If anything happened to love
 I would love every dream that I own
 Or how could I dream alone
 If anything happened to you
 I know my heart will always choose you
 No one could take your place
 And so, if I should ever lose you
 I couldn't look my heart in the face
 Don't let anything happen to you
 I'd be lost if I found we were through
 So think what would happen to me
 If anything happened to you
 
 I know my heart will always choose you
 No one could take your place
 And so, if I should ever lose you
 I couldn't look my heart in the face
 Don't let anything happen to you
 I'd be lost if I found we were through
 So think what would happen to me
 If anything happened to you
 I'd be so alone and blue
 I don't know what I would do
 My love if anything happened to you
 
 If dreams come true
 I'll be with you
 I love that smile in your eyes
 You see a dream in the skies
 In your caress there is happiness
 And love in view
 If dreams come true
 
 
 Ask me how do I feel
 Ask me now that we're cosy and clingin'
 Well, sir, all I can say
 Is if I were a bell, I'd be ringin'
 From the moment we kissed tonight
 That's the way I've just gotta behave
 Boy, if I were a lamp, I'd light
 Or if I were a banner, I'd wave
 
 Ask me how do I feel
 Little me with my quiet upbringing
 Well, sir, all I can say
 Is if I were a gate, I'd be swinging
 And if I were a watch
 I'd start popping my springs
 Or if I were a bell
 I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding
 
 Yes, I knew my morale would crack
 From the wonderful way that you looked
 Boy, if I were a duck, I'd quack
 Or if I were a goose, I'd be cooked
 
 Ask me how do I feel
 Ask me now that we're fondly caressing
 Well, if I were a salad
 I know I'd be splashing my dressing
 Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
 Or if I were a gate, I would swing
 Have a fling almost any old thing
 Or if I were a bell
 I'd go ding dong, ding dong
 Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding, ding dong
 
 If it's the last thing I do, I'll make you mine
 Darling, the first thing is you, in my design
 Just like the stars guard the moon above me
 That's just how I'll guard our love, so love me
 
 Please, love me
 If it's the last thing I do, I'll take your hand
 And though I won't say a word, you'll understand
 I'll build a dream just for two
 
 And then I'll make it come true
 If it's the very last thing I do
 Just like the stars guard the moon above me
 That's just how I'll guard our love, so love me
 
 Please, love me
 If it's the last thing I do, I'll take your hand
 And though I won't say a word, you'll understand
 I'll build a dream just for two
 
 And then I'll make it come true
 If it's the very last thing I do
 
 I would bring you flowers in the morning
 Wild roses as the sun begins to shine
 Sweet perfume in tiny jeweled caskets
 If I thought you'd ever change your mind
 
 I would take you where the music's sweetest
 And feed you winter fruits and summer wine
 Show you things you've only read in story books
 If I thought you'd ever change your mind
 
 I would bring you happiness
 Wrapped up in a box and tied with a yellow bow
 I would bring you summer rain and rainbow skies to make your garden grow
 And in the winter snow my songs would keep you from the cold
 
 But what use of flowers in the morning
 When the garden they should grow in is not mine
 And what use is sunshine if I'm crying
 And my falling tears are mingled with the wine
 
 I would bring you happiness
 Wrapped up in a box and tied with a yellow bow
 I would bring you rainbow skies
 And summer rain to make your garden grow
 And in the winter snow my songs would keep you from the cold
 
 I would bring you flowers in the morning
 Wild roses when the sun begins to shine
 Winter fruits and summer wine
 Sweet perfume and columbine
 If I thought you'd ever change your mind
 If I thought you'd ever change your mind
 
 If you ever should leave
 Why would I want to live?
 Darling, you must believe
 Won't you try to forgive
 What a fool I would be
 If I fooled with your love for me?
 I'd be wrong from the start
 I'd be unfair to my heart
 So whatever you do
 Don't you say that we're through
 I'd do nothing but grieve
 If you ever should leave
 
 Oh, what a fool I would be
 If I fooled with your love for me
 I'd be wrong from the start
 I'd be unfair to my heart
 So whatever you do
 Don't you say that were through
 I'd do nothing but grieve
 If you ever should leave
 I'd do nothing but grieve
 If you ever should leave
 
 If you only knew how in love with you
 I have always been hopin' you'd give in
 If you only knew
 
 One would never guess what I must confess
 But it's really so, though you may not know
 You're my happiness
 
 Fate has started a story so blind
 You can make it the perfect rhyme
 
 If you only knew what your love could do
 You would say, "Okay, darling, lead the way"
 If you only knew
 
 Ah, fate has started a story so blind
 You can make it the perfect rhyme
 
 If you only knew what your love could do
 You would say, "Okay, darling, lead the way"
 If you only knew, if you only knew
 
 Blow ill wind, blow away, find my love today
 You're blowin' me no good, no good
 Go ill wind, go away, skies are oh, so gray
 Around my neighborhood and that's no good
 
 You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
 Ain't that a shame
 It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
 From out of nowhere, when loves to blame
 
 So ill wind, blow away, find my love today
 You're blowin' me no good, no good, no good
 
 Imagination is funny
 It makes a cloudy day sunny
 Makes a bee think of honey
 Just as I think of you
 
 Imagination is crazy
 Your whole perspective gets hazy
 Starts you asking a daisy
 What to do, what to do?
 
 Have you ever felt
 A gentle touch and then a kiss
 And then and then
 Find it's only your imagination again? Oh, well
 
 Imagination is silly
 You go around willy-nilly
 For example I go around wanting you
 And yet I can't imagine that you want me too
 
 I went down to the dance
 Such a clown by the wall
 Invited to dance
 By no one at all
 
 The couples danced fine
 So charming and gay
 But nobody wants
 To look over my way
 
 So awfully sad
 Dissatisfied
 I hurt so bad
 I almost cried
 Imagine my frustration with no
 Invitation to dance
 
 Head high, standing tall
 Who else, who else could I be?
 But Ella next to the wall
 A fella who likes what they see?
 
 And then in my ear
 Someone said to me
 Wallflower, my dear
 How come you can't see
 They couldn't care less?
 They're not impressed
 As you might have guessed
 You're in excess
 
 Imagine my frustration with no
 Invitation to dance
 
 I smiled to the crowd
 Tip toe and alert
 Yes, the band blues went loud
 But next on a flirt
 
 A voice said to me
 Wallflower, my dear
 You're sweet as can be
 But how come you're here
 They couldn't care less
 About your dress
 You're in a mess
 And in excess
 
 Imagine my frustration with no
 Invitation to dance
 
 In a mellow tone
 Feeling fancy free
 And I'm not alone
 I've got company
 
 Everything's OK
 The live long day
 With this mellow song
 I can't go wrong
 
 In a mellow tone
 That's the way to live
 If you mope and groan
 Something's gotta give
 
 Just go your way
 And laugh and play
 There's joy unknown
 In a mellow tone
 
 In a mellow tone
 
 In a mellow tone
 Feeling fancy free
 And I'm not alone
 I've got company
 
 Everything's OK
 The live long day
 With this mellow song
 I can't go wrong
 
 In a mellow tone
 That's the way to live
 If you mope and groan
 Something's gotta give
 
 Just go your way
 And laugh and play
 There's joy unknown
 In a mellow tone
 In a mellow tone
 In a mellow tone
 
 In a Sentimental Mood I can see
 The stars come through my room
 While your loving attitude is
 Like a flame that lights the gloom
 On the wings of ev'ry kiss
 Drift a melody so strange and sweet
 In this sentimental bliss you make
 My Paradise complete
 Rose pearls seem to fall
 It's all like a dream to call you mine
 My heart's lighter thing since you
 Made me this night a thing divine
 In A Sentimental Mood
 I'm within a world so heavenly
 For I never dreamt that you'd be
 Loving sentimental me
 In A Sentimental Mood I can see
 The stars come through my room
 While your loving attitude is
 Like a flame that lights the gloom
 On the wings of ev'ry kiss
 Drift a melody so strange and sweet
 In this sentimental bliss you make
 My Paradise complete
 Rose pearls seem to fall
 It's all like a dream to call you mine
 My heart's lighter thing since you
 Made me this night a thing divine
 In A Sentimental Mood
 I'm within a world so heavenly
 For I never dreamt that you'd be
 Loving sentimental me
 
 I want you; be around
 When that evening sun goes down
 I want you; be around
 Keep my both feet on the ground
 When that evening sun goes down
 
 I want you, understand
 Little girl, take me by my hand
 I want you, understand
 I wanna be your loving man
 When that evening sun goes down
 
 If it's nice, we'll go for a walk
 A stroll in the clear moonlight
 Singing a song; won't take long
 Everything gonna be all right
 
 And I wanna hold you oh-so near
 Keep you, darling, from all fear
 I wanna hold you oh-so near
 Nibble on your little ear
 When that evening sun goes down
 
 If it's nice, go for a walk
 Stroll in the clear moonlight
 Sing you a song; won't take long
 Everything gonna be all right
 
 And I wanna hold you oh-so near
 Keep you, darling, from all fear
 I wanna hold you oh-so near
 Nibble on your little ear
 When that evening sun goes down
 When that evening sun goes down
 When that evening sun goes down
 
 I come to the garden alone
 While the dew is still on the roses
 And the voice I hear falling on my ear
 The son of God discloses
 
 And He walks with me
 And He talks with me
 And He tells me I am His own
 And the joy we share as we tarry there
 None other has ever known
 
 He speaks and the sound of His voice
 Is so sweet that the birds hush their singing
 And the melody that He gave to me
 Within my heart is ringing
 
 And He walks with me
 And He talks with me
 And He tells me I am His own
 And the joy we share as we tarry there
 None other has ever known
 
 And the joy we share as we tarry there
 None other has ever known
 
 In the still of the night
 As I gaze from of my window
 At the moon in its flight
 My thoughts all stray to you
 
 In the still of the night
 While the world lies in slumber
 Oh, the times without number
 Darling, when I say to you
 
 Do you love me
 As I love you?
 Are you my life to be
 My dream come true?
 Or will this dream of mine
 Fade out of sight?
 
 Like the moon growing dim
 On the rim of the hill
 In the chill, still of the night
 
 In the still of the night
 
 In the wee small hours of the morning
 While the whole wide world is fast asleep
 You lie awake and think about the boy
 And never, ever think of counting sheep
 
 When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
 You'd be his if only he would call
 In the wee small hours of the morning
 That's the time you miss him most of all
 
 When your lonely heart has learned its lesson
 You'd be his if only he would call
 In the wee small hours of the morning
 That's the time you miss him most of all
 
 Summer, you old Indian summer
 You're the tear that comes after June-time's laughter
 You see so many dreams that don't come true
 Dreams we fashioned when summertime was new
 
 You are here to watch over
 Some heart that is broken by a word that somebody left unspoken
 You're the ghost of a romance in June going astray
 Fading too soon; that's why I say
 Farewell to you, Indian summer
 
 You are here to watch over
 A heart that is broken by a word that somebody left unspoken
 You're the ghost of a romance in June going astray
 Fading too soon; that's why I say
 Farewell to you, Indian summer
 You old Indian summer
 
 Into each life some rain must fall
 But too much is falling in mine
 Into each heart some tears must fall
 But some day the sun will shine
 Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
 But when I think of you another shower starts
 Into each life some rain must fall
 But too much is falling in mine
 
 Into each life some rain must fall
 But too much is falling in mine
 Into each heart some tears must fall
 But some day the sun will shine
 Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
 But when I think of you another shower starts
 Into each life some rain must fall
 But too much is falling in mine
 
 Into each and every life some rain has got to fall
 But too much of that stuff is fallin' into mine
 And into each heart some tears gotta fall
 And I know that someday that sun is bound to shine
 Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
 But when I think of you, another shower starts
 Into each life some rain must fall
 But too much is falling in mine
 
 Why did I wander
 Here and there and yonder
 Wasting precious time
 For no reason or rhyme
 
 Isn't it a pity
 Isn't it a crime
 My journeys ended
 Everything is splendid
 
 Meeting you today
 Has given me a wonderful idea
 Here I stay
 It's a funny thing
 
 I look at you
 I get a thrill
 I never knew
 Isn't it a pity
 
 We never met before?
 Here we are at last
 It's like a dream
 The two of us
 
 A perfect team
 Isn't it a pity
 We never met before?
 Imagine all the lonely years you wasted
 
 Fishing for salmon
 Losing at backgammon
 What joys un-tasted
 My nights were sour
 
 Spent with Schopenhauer
 Let's forget the past
 Let's both agree
 That I'm for you
 
 And you're for me
 And it's such a pity
 We never, never met before
 
 It's an awful pity
 We never, never met before
 
 Isn't it romantic?
 Music in the night, a dream that can be heard
 Isn't it romantic?
 Moving shadows write the oldest magic word
 
 I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
 While all the world is saying you were meant for love
 
 Isn't it romantic?
 Merely to be young on such a night as this?
 Isn't it romantic?
 Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss
 
 Sweet symbols in the moonlight
 Do you mean that I will fall in love perchance?
 
 Isn't it romance?
 Sweet symbols in the moonlight
 Do you mean that I will fall in love perchance?
 
 Isn't it romantic?
 Isn't it romance?
 
 The weather is fright'ning
 The thunder and lightning
 Seem to be having their way
 But as far as I'm concerned
 It's a lovely day
 The turn in the weather
 Will keep us together
 So I can honestly say
 That as far as I'm concerned
 It's a lovely day
 And everything's O.K.
 
 Yes, isn't this a lovely day
 To be caught in the rain
 You were going on your way
 Now you've got to remain
 
 Yes, just as you were going
 Leaving me all at sea
 The clouds broke
 They broke and oh
 What a break for me
 
 I can see the sun up high
 Tho' we're caught in the storm
 I can see where you and I
 Could be cozy and warm
 
 Let the rain pitter patter
 But it really doesn't matter
 If the skies are gray
 Baby, long as I can be with you
 It's a lovely day
 
 Isn't this a lovely day
 To be caught in the rain
 You were going on your way
 Now you've got to remain
 
 Just as you were going
 Leaving me all at sea
 The clouds broke
 They broke and oh
 What a break for me
 
 I can see the sun up high
 Tho' we're caught in the storm
 I can see where you and I
 Could be cozy and warm
 
 Let the rain pitter patter
 But it really doesn't matter
 If the skies are gray
 Long as I can be with you
 It's a lovely day
 
 I can see the sun up high
 Tho' we're caught in the storm
 
 I can see where you and I
 Could be cozy and warm
 
 Let the rain pitter patter
 But it really doesn't matter
 If the skies are gray
 Long as I can be with you
 It's a lovely day
 Long as I can be with you
 It's a lovely day
 
 Istanbul was Constantinople
 Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople
 Been a long time gone, Constantinople
 Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night
 
 Every gal in Constantinople
 Lives in Istanbul, not Constantinople
 So if you've a date in Constantinople
 She'll be waiting in Istanbul
 
 Even old New York was once New Amsterdam
 Why they changed it I can't say
 People just liked it better that way
 
 So, take me back to Constantinople
 No, you can't go back to Constantinople
 Been a long time gone, Constantinople
 Why did Constantinople get the works?
 That's nobody's business but the Turks

 It ain't necessarily so!
 
 It came upon the midnight clear,
 That glorious song of old,
 From angels bending near the earth,
 To touch their harps of gold:
 "Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
 From heavens all gracious King!"
 The world in solemn stillness lay
 To hear the angels sing.
 
 Still through the cloven skies they come,
 With peaceful wings unfurled;
 And still their heavenly music floats
 O'er all the weary world:
 Above its sad and lowly plains
 They bend on hovering wing,
 And ever o'er its Babel sounds
 The blessed angels sing.
 
 For lo! the days are hastening on,
 By prophets seen of old,
 When with the ever-circling years
 comes round the age of gold
 when peace shall over all the earth
 it's ancient slpendors fling
 and our whole world give back the song
 which now the angels sing
 
 It don't mean a thing
 If it ain't got that swing
 (doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
 Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
 It don't mean a thing
 All you got to do is sing
 (doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
 Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
 It makes no diff'rence 
 If it's sweet or hot
 Just give that rhythm 
 Ev'rything you got
 Oh, it don't mean a thing
 If it ain't got that swing
 (doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
 Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
 
 It had to be you
 It had to be you
 I've wandered around
 Finally found
 Somebody who
 Could make me be true
 Whoa, whoa, whoa
 Could make me be blue
 And even be glad
 Just to be sad
 Thinkin' of you
 
 Some others I've seen
 Might never be mean
 Might never be cross
 Or try to be boss
 But they wouldn't do
 For nobody else
 Gave me a thrill
 With all your faults
 I love you still
 It had to be you
 Wonderful you
 It had to be you
 
 'Cause nobody else
 Gave me a thrill
 With all yo' faults
 I love you still now
 And it had to be you
 It just had to be you
 It had to be you
 
 The things I used to like, I don't like any more,
 I want a lot of other things I've never had before,
 It's just like my mama says, I sit around and mourn
 Pretending that I am so wonderful and knowing I'm adored
 
 I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm,
 I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string,
 I'd say that I had spring fever,
 But I know it isn't spring.
 
 I'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented,
 Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
 Oh, why should I have spring fever,
 When it isn't even spring?
 
 I keep wishing I were somewhere else,
 Walking down a strange new street,
 Hearing words I have never never heard,
 From a man I've yet to meet.
 
 I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,
 I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,
 I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,
 Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,
 But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,
 That it might as well be spring,
 It might as well be, might as well be,
 It might as well be spring.
 
 Once I laughed when I heard you saying
 That I'd be playing solitaire
 Uneasy in my easy chair
 It never entered my mind
 And once you told me I was mistaken
 
 That I'd awaken with the sun
 And ordered orange juice for one
 It never entered my mind
 You had what I lack, myself
 
 Now I even have to scratch my back myself
 Once you warned me that if you scorned me
 I'd say a lonely prayer again
 And wish that you were there again
 To get into my hair again
 It never entered my mind
 
 Once you warned me that if you scorned me
 I'd say a lonely prayer again
 And wish that you were there again
 To get into my hair again
 It never entered my mind
 
 It was written in the stars 
 What was written in the stars shall be 
 It was written in the skies 
 That the heart and not the eyes shall see 
 
 And so whether it bring joy 
 Whether it bring woe 
 It shall be done 
 Now suddenly I know 
 You are the one 
 
 Here as in a daydream 
 By my side you stand 
 Here with my tomorrows 
 In your hands 
 
 It was written high above 
 That I have to have your love 
 Or I'll never be free 
 And cloudy though the day be 
 Crazy though I may be 
 What the stars foretold shall be 
 
 Here as in a daydream 
 By my side you stand 
 Here with my tomorrows 
 In your hands 
 
 It was written high above 
 That I have to have your love 
 Or I'll never be free 
 And cloudy though the day be 
 Crazy though I may be 
 What the stars foretold shall be 
 
 And so shall it be
 
 Heart and soul took control
 Took control of me
 Paid my dues, spread the news
 Hands across the sea
 Put me down, turned me 'round
 Turned me round to see
 Marble halls, open doors
 Someone found the key
 And it's only what you do
 That keeps coming back on you
 And it's only what you say
 That can give yourself away
 
 Underground sight and sound
 Human symphony
 Heard the voice, had no choice
 Needed to be free
 Fly me high, touch the sky
 Left the earth below
 Heard the line, saw the sign
 Knew which way to go
 'Cause it's easier to try
 Than to prove it can't be done
 And it's easier to stay
 Than to turn around and run
 
 It's a blue world
 It takes somebody to help somebody
 Oh, it's a blue world
 It's a new world
 It needs somebody to love somebody
 Oh, it's a blue world
 
 Heart and soul took control
 Took control of me
 Paid my dues, spread the news
 Hands across the sea
 Put me down, turned me 'round
 Turned me 'round to see

 Someone found the key

 That keeps coming back on you
 And it's only what you say
 That can give yourself away
 'Cause it's easier to try

 It's a blue world

 Oh, it's a blue world
 
 It's a lovely day today
 So whatever you've got to do
 You've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true
 
 And I hope whatever you've got to do
 Is something that can be done by two
 For I'd really like to stay
 
 It's a lovely day today
 And whatever you've got to do
 I'd be so happy to be doing it with you
 
 But if you've got something that must be done
 And it can only be done by one
 There is nothing more to say
 Except it's a lovely day for saying
 It's a lovely day
 
 It's a lovely day today
 And whatever I've got to do
 I've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true
 
 But perhaps whatever I've got to do
 Is something that can be done by two
 If it is then you could stay
 
 It's a lovely day today
 But you're probably busy too
 So I suppose there's nothing we can do
 
 For if you've got something that must be done
 And it can only be done by one
 There is nothing more to say
 Except it's a lovely day for saying
 It's a lovely day
 
 It's a lovely day today
 If you've something that must get done
 Now don't forget two heads are better than just one
 
 And besides I'm certain if you knew me
 You'd find I'm very good company
 Won't you kindly let me stay?
 
 It's a lovely day today
 And whatever we've got to do
 We've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true
 
 And I know whatever we've got to do
 Is something that can be done by two
 
 I'll say it's a lovely day for saying
 It's a lovely day
 
 It's a pity to say goodnight
 Because I never saw stars so bright
 But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
 Give me a goodnight kiss
 
 It's a pity to say farewell
 Because the man in the moon won't tell
 But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
 Give me a goodnight kiss
 
 How's about tomorrow night just you and me?
 I'll be waiting for you darling 
 Underneath the apple tree
 
 It's a pity to say goodnight
 Because I want you to hold me tight
 But if gotta go home, you gotta go home
 Give me a goodnight kiss
 
 It's the wrong time, and the wrong place
 Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
 It's not his face, but such a charming face
 That it's all right with me
 
 It's the wrong song, in the wrong style
 Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
 It's not his smile, but such a lovely smile
 That it's all right with me
 
 You can't know how happy I am that we met
 I'm strangely attracted to you
 There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
 Don't you want to forget someone, too?
 
 It's the wrong game, with the wrong chips
 Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
 They're not his lips, but they're such tempting lips
 That, if some night, you are free
 Dear, it's all right, yes, it's all right with me
 
 You can't know how happy I am that we met
 I'm strangely attracted to you

 They're not his lips, but they're such tempting lips
 That, if some night, you are free
 Dear, it's all right, it's all right with me
 
 I feel a sudden urge to sing
 The kind of ditty that invokes the spring
 So, control your desire to curse
 While I crucify the verse
 This verse I've started seems to me
 The "tin pan-tithesis" of melody
 So to spare you all the pain
 I'll skip the darn thing and sing the refrain
 
 The night is young, the skies are clear
 And if you want to go walkin', dear
 It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely
 
 I understand the reason why
 You're sentimental, 'cause so am I
 It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely
 
 You can tell at a glance what a swell night this is for romance
 You can hear, dear mother nature murmuring low "let yourself go"
 
 So please be sweet, my chickadee
 And when I kiss ya, just say to me
 "It's delightful, it's delicious, it's delectable, it's delirious
 It's dilemma, it's de limit, it's deluxe, it's de-lovely"

 I can't cover up my feelings
 In the name of love
 Or play it safe
 For a while that was easy
 And if living for myself
 Is what I'm guilty of
 Go on and sentence me
 I'll still be free
 
 It's my turn
 To see what I can see
 I hope you'll understand
 This time's just for me
 
 Because it's my turn
 With no apologies
 I've given up the truth
 To those I've tried to please
 
 But now it's my turn
 If I don't have all the answers
 At least I know
 I'll take my share of chances
 Ain't no use of holding on
 When nothing stays the same
 
 So I'll let it rain
 'Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
 And I'll let you go
 Though I know it won't be easy
 
 It's my turn
 With no more room for lies
 For years I've seen my life
 Through someone else's eyes
 
 And now it's my turn
 To try and find my way
 And if I should get lost
 At least I'll own today
 
 It's my turn
 Yes, it's my turn
 And there ain't no use in holding on
 When nothing stays the same
 
 So I'll let it rain
 'Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
 And I'll let you go
 Though I know it won't be easy
 
 It's my turn
 To see what I can see
 I hope you'll understand
 This time's just for me
 
 Because it's my turn
 To turn and say goodbye
 I sure would like to know
 That you're still on my side
 
 Because it's my turn
 It's my turn
 It's my turn
 To start from number one
 Trying to undo
 Some damage that's been done
 
 But now it's my turn
 To reach and touch the sky
 No one's gonna say
 At least I didn't try
 
 It's my turn
 Yes, it's my turn
 It's my turn
 It's my turn
 It's my turn
 
 Say, it's only a paper moon
 Sailing over a cardboard sea
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me
 
 Yes, it's only a canvas sky
 Hanging over a muslin tree
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me
 
 Without your love
 It's a honky tonk parade
 Without your love
 It's a melody played in a penny arcade
 
 It's a Barnum and Bailey world
 Just as phony as it can be
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me

 How happy I would be
 If you believed in me
 
 Does he love me?
 It's too soon to know
 Can I believe him
 When he tells me so?
 And is he fooling?
 Is this all a game?
 Am I the fire
 Or just another flame?
 
 A one-sided love would break my heart
 He may be just acting and playing a part
 If he don't love me
 Let him tell me so
 And I can't hold him
 If he wants to go
 And though I'll cry
 When he's gone
 I won't die
 I'll live on
 If it's so
 It's too soon
 Way too soon to know
 
 And though I'll cry
 When he's gone
 I won't die
 I'll live on
 If it's so
 It's too soon
 Way too soon to know
 
 It's wonderful to look into your eyes
 And realize you care a little bit
 It's wonderful to know that you love me
 
 It's glorious to feel that I'm a part of you, sweetheart
 To share your happiness
 It's marvelous how lovely love can be
 
 Who dreamed that I'd be allowed
 Through the doorway of heaven?
 I'm drifting high on a cloud
 You're an angel and this is heaven
 
 It's wonderful to have your lips divine combined with mine
 And dream forever more
 It's wonderful to know that you love me
 
 Who dreamed that I'd be allowed
 Through the doorway of heaven?
 I'm drifting high, high on a cloud
 You're an angel and this is heaven
 
 Oh, it's wonderful to have your lips divine combined with mine
 And dream forever more
 It's wonderful to know that you love me
 
 It's glorious
 It's marvelous
 Oh darling, it's wonderful
 
 Lord, this house is goin' to get raided, yes, sir
 
 Thirty days in jail with my back turned to the wall, turned to the wall
 Thirty days in jail with my back turned to the wall
 Look here, Mr. Jail-keeper, put another gal in my stall
 
 I don't mind bein' in jail, but I got to stay there so long, so long
 I don't mind bein' in jail, but I got to stay there so long, so long
 When every friend I have is done shook hands and gone
 
 You better stop your man from tickling me under my chin, under my chin
 You better stop your man from tickling me under my chin
 'Cause if he keeps on tickling, I'm sure gonna take him on in
 
 Good morning, blues, blues, how do you do? How do you do?
 Good morning, blues, blues, how do you do?
 Say, I just come here to have a few words with you
 
 Jeepers creepers, where'd you get them peepers?
 Jeepers creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
 Gosh, oh, get up; how'd they get so lit up?
 Gosh, oh, gee, oh, how'd they get that size?
 
 Golly gee, when you turn them heaters on
 Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on
 
 Jeepers creepers, where'd you get them peepers?
 Oh, those weepers--how they hypnotize
 
 Jeepers creepers, where'd you get them peepers?
 Oh, those weepers--how they hypnotize
 Where did ya get those?
 Golly, where'd you get those?
 Where did you get them there eyes?
 
 They call it that jersey bounce
 A rhythm that really counts
 The temperature always mounts
 Wherever they play, the funny rhythm they play
 
 It started on journal square
 And somebody heard it there
 He put it right on the air
 And now you hear it everywhere
 
 Uptown, gave it new licks
 Downtown, added some tricks
 No town, makes it sound, the same
 As where it came from
 
 So if you don't feel so hot
 Go out to some jersey spot
 And whether you're hep or not
 The jersey bounce'll make you swing
 
 How I love that jersey bounce
 
 Oh come on and play that jersey bounce
 
 They call it that jersey bounce
 A rhythm that really counts
 The temperature always mounts
 Whenever they play that jersey bounce
 
 It started on journal square
 And somebody heard it there
 He put it right on the air
 That tune called the jersey bounce
 
 Uptown, gave it new licks
 Downtown, added some tricks
 No town, make it sound the same
 As where it came from
 
 So if you don't feel so hot
 Go out to some jersey spot
 And whether you're hep or not
 The jersey bounce'll make you swing
 
 Ounce by ounce
 The jersey bounce
 Puts you right in the swing
 That jersey bounce
 It'll make you swing
 
 Give me that jersey bounce
 
 Why am I sitting alone tonight,
 When I could be out where the lights are bright?
 It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.
 Why am I wasting these precious years?
 Why am I crying these bitter tears?
 It's all because of Jim, It's all because of Jim.
 
 Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers,
 Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours,
 Don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim.
 Jim never tells me I'm his hearts desire.
 I never seem to set his love afire
 Gone are the years I've wasted on him.
 
 Sometimes when I get feeling low,
 I say "Let's call it quits."
 Then I hang on and let him go
 Breaking my heart in bits.
 Some day I know tht Jim will up and leave me,
 But even if he does you can believe me,
 I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim.
 
 Jingle bells, jingle bells
 Jingle all the way,
 Oh what fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh, 
 Jingle bells, jingle bells
 Jingle all the way,
 Oh what fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh.
 
 Dashing through the snow
 In a one-horse open sleigh
 Through the fields we go
 Laughing all the way.
 Bells on bob-tail ring
 Making spirits bright
 What fun it is to ride and sing
 A sleighing song tonight.
 
 Jingle bells, jing-jingle bells
 Jingle all the way,
 Oh what fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh, brruup
 Jingle bells, jingle bells
 Jingle all the way,
 Oh what fun it is to ride
 In a one-horse open sleigh.

 Johnny could only sing one note
 And the note he sings was this
 Ah!
 Poor Johnny one-note
 sang out with "gusto"
 And just overlorded the place
 Poor Johnny one-note
 yelled willy nilly
 Until he was bleu in the face
 For holding one note was his ace
 Couldn't hear the brass
 Couldn't hear the drum
 He was in a class
 By himself, by gum!
 
 Poor Johnny one-note
 Got in Aida
 Indeed a great chance to be brave
 He took his one note
 Howled like the North Wind
 Brought forth wind that made critics rave,
 While Verdi turned round in his grave!
 
 Couldn't hear the flute
 Or the big trombone
 Ev'ry one was mute
 Johnny stood alone.
 Cats and dogs stopped yapping
 Lions in the zoo
 All were jealous of Johnny's big trill
 Thunder claps stopped clapping,
 Traffic ceased its roar,
 And they tell us Niag'ra stood still.
 He stopped the train whistles,
 Boat whistles,
 steam whistles,
 Cop whistles,
 all whistles bowed to his skill
 Sing Johnny One-Note,
 Sing out with "gusto" and
 Just overwhelm all the crowd
 Ah!
 So sing Johnny One-Note, out loud!!
 Sing Johnny One-Note
 Sing Johnny One-Note out loud!
 
 Joy to the world, the Lord is come
 Let earth receive her King
 Let every heart prepare Him room
 And heaven and nature sing and heaven and nature sing
 And Heaven and heaven and nature sing
 
 Joy to the world the Savior reigns
 Let men their songs employ
 While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
 Repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy
 Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
 
 He rules the world with truth and grace
 And makes the nations prove
 The glories of His righteousness
 And wonders of His love and wonders of His love
 And wonders and wonders of His love
 
 Joy to the world, the Lord is come
 Let earth receive her King
 Let every heart prepare Him room
 And heaven and nature sing and heaven and nature sing
 And Heaven and heaven and nature sing
 
 It's just a simple melody
 Designed to haunt your memory
 It's bound to get you instantly
 
 Oh, it doesn't help you to beware
 Before you even know it's there
 You're swaying to its catchy air
 
 Dancing with your favorite thrill
 He will hold you closer still
 
 And suddenly you'll both agree
 That dancing can be heavenly
 To just a simple melody
 
 De de de, that melody
 De de de, keeps haunting me
 It's just a simple melody
 
 De de, de de de, de de
 Duh duh, doo doo, de de
 De de, de de, doo doo de
 Oh, da da doo, dum de, doo doo, melody
 
 I don't go out walking
 I ain't for no talking
 My baby's done left me
 Just a sittin' and a rockin'
 If I had been scheming
 Instead of just dreaming
 He'd never have left me
 Just a sittin' and a rockin'
 
 Sittin all day without holding my baby
 Makes me so blue and sad
 If he don't hurry and come back
 It's a cinch to drive me mad
 Now if I don't find him
 I hope you'll remind him
 That I'm staying where he left me
 Just a sittin' and a rockin'
 
 All day
 Don't go out a walking
 And I for no talking
 My baby's done left me
 Just a sittin' and a rockin'
 
 All day
 If I had been scheming
 Instead of just dreaming
 He'd never have left me
 Just a sittin' and a rockin'
 Sittin all day without holding my baby
 
 I miss my lonely papa
 If he don't hurry and come back
 It's a cinch to, I'll blow my toppa
 Now if I don't find him
 I hope you'll remind him
 That I'm staying where he left me
 Just a sittin' and a rockin'
 
 Rockin' and a sittin'
 Sittin' and a rockin'
 All day
 
 It happened to me
 On a trip to the West Indies
 Oh, I'm all at sea
 Since that trip to the West Indies
 
 I'm jittery
 I'm twittery
 I guess I'm done for
 I guess I'm through
 And it's something about which there's nothing anyone can do
 
 It isn't love
 It isn't money trouble
 It's a very funny trouble:
 
 It's just another rhumba
 But it certainly has my numb-bah
 So much so, that I can't eat or slum-bah
 Can you imagine anything dumb-bah?
 
 Why did I have to plan a
 Vacation in Havana?
 Why did I take that trip
 That made me lose my grip?
 Oh! That piece of music laid me low
 There it goes again:
 
 Just another rhumba
 Which I heard only last Septum-bah
 I'm a wreck, why did I have to succumb-bah
 Can you imagine anything dumb-bah?
 Why did I have to succumb-bah
 To that rhumba?
 
 I'm the cucaracha, who just went blah
 And gave up swinging ha-cha, ahah
 At first it was devine-ah
 But it turned out a Cuban Frankenstein-ah
 
 It's got me by the throat-ah!
 Oh, what's the antidote-ah?
 It brought me woe and strife-ah
 Oh, where's a gun or knife-ah?
 It's the rhumba that blighted my life
 There it goes again
 
 Just another rhumba
 But it certainly has my numb-bah
 So much so, that I can't eat or slum-bah
 Can you imagine anything dumb-bah?
 Why did I have to succumb-bah
 To that rhumba?
 
 There it goes again
 Just another rhumba
 But it certainly has my numb-bah
 So much so, that I can't eat or slum-bah
 Can you imagine anything dumb-bah?
 Why did I have to succumb-bah
 To that rhumba?
 
 
 As Dorothy Parker once said
 To her boyfriend, "fare thee well"
 As Columbus announced, when he knew he was bounced
 "It was swell, Isabel, swell"
 
 As Abelard said to Eloise
 "Don't forget to drop a line to me, please"
 As Juliet cried, in her Romeo's ear
 "Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear"
 
 It was just one of those things
 Just one of those crazy flings
 One of those bells that now and then rings
 Just one of those things
 
 It was just one of those nights
 Just one of those fabulous flights
 A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
 Just one of those things
 
 If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
 When we started painting the town
 We'd have been aware that our love affair
 It was too hot, not to cool down
 
 So good-bye, dear, and amen
 Here's hoping we meet now and then
 It was great fun
 But it was just one of those things
 
 If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
 When we started painting the town
 We'd have been aware that our love affair
 Was too hot, not to cool down
 
 So good-bye, dear, and amen
 Here's hoping we meet now and then
 It was great fun
 But it was just one of those things
 
 Just one of those things
 
 Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
 Want you to know it really is pleasin'
 Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
 Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
 Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
 I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
 Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
 Missing you since you went away
 Singing the blues away each day
 Counting the rights and waiting for you 
 I'm in the mood to let you know 
 I never knew I loved you so 
 Please say you love me too 
 When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
 So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
 Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight

 Just you, just me
 Let's find a cozy spot
 To cuddle and coo
 
 Just us, just we
 I've missed an awful lot
 My trouble is you
 
 Oh, gee!
 What are your charms for?
 What are my arms for?
 Use your imagination!
 Just you, just me
 I'll tie a lover's knot
 'Round wonderful you!
 
 Keep cool, fool, if you don't know what you're doing
 Keep cool, fool, 'cause you don't know what you're doing
 Keep cool, fool, if you don't know what you're doing
 Or else you're gonna bring somebody down
 
 Keep cool, fool, if you don't want any trouble
 Keep cool, fool, 'cause you don't know what you're saying
 Keep cool, fool, if you don't know what you're saying
 Or else you're gonna bring somebody down
 
 Twice
 It's better to be big than to be small
 
 It ain't nice
 Or just like Humpty Dumpty on the wall
 Well, you're going to fall
 
 Keep cool, fool, if you don't want any trouble
 Keep cool, fool, or your trouble will go double
 Keep cool, fool; don't you blow up like a bubble
 Or else you're gonna bring somebody down
 
 Twice
 It's better to be big than to be small
 
 It ain't nice
 Or just like Humpty Dumpty on the wall
 Well, you're going to fall
 
 Like the bear
 Going nowhere, oh, Brother Rufus
 
 No, I'm like the chicken
 Always sticking
 That's why I say to you
 Keep cool, fool
 Keep cool, fool
 Oh, keep cool, fool
 If you don't know what you're doing
 Or else you're gonna bring somebody down
 Or else you're gonna bring somebody down
 Or else you're gonna bring somebody down
 
 I like cake, no mistake, but, baby, if you insist
 I'll cut out the cake just for your sake
 Baby, come on and knock me a kiss
 
 I like pie; I hope to die just to get a load of this
 When you get high, doggone the pie
 Baby, come on and knock me a kiss
 
 When you pressed your little lips to mine
 It was then I understood
 They taste like candy, brandy, and wine
 Peaches, bananas, and everything good
 
 I love jam and no flim flam; scratch that off my list
 This ain't no jam; the jam can scram
 Baby, come on and knock me a kiss
 
 When you pressed your little lips to mine
 It was then I understood
 They taste like candy, brandy, and wine
 Peaches, bananas, and everything good
 
 I like cars and big cigars, but, baby, they won't be missed
 If everyday I hear you say
 Baby, come on and knock me a kiss
 Baby, come on and knock me a kiss
 
 I don't want to lose you
 This good thing that I got
 'Cause if I do
 I will surely, surely lose a lot
 'Cause your love is better
 Than any love I know
 It's like thunder and lightning
 The way you love me is frightening
 You better knock, knock on wood, baby
 
 I'm not superstitious about ya
 But I can't take no chance
 You got me spinnin', baby
 You know I'm in a trance
 'Cause your love is better
 Than any love I know
 It's like thunder, lightning
 The way you love me is frightenin'
 You better knock, knock, knock on wood, baby
 
 Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
 Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
 Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
 Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
 Think I better knock
 
 It's no secret about it
 'Cause with his lovin' touch
 He sees to it
 That I get enough
 With his touch all over
 You know it means so much
 It's like thunder and lightnin'
 The way you love me is frightenin'
 You better knock, knock on wood, baby
 
 Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
 Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
 Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
 Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood
 
 L is for the way you look at me.
 O is for the only one I see.
 V is very, very extraordinary.
 E is even more than anyone that you adore can.
 
 Love is all that I can give to you,
 Love is more than just a game for two.
 Two in love can make it.
 Take my heart and please don't break it,
 Love was made for me and you.

 Hold me close and hold me fast
 The magic spell you cast
 This is la vie en rose
 
 When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
 And though I close my eyes
 I see la vie en rose
 
 When you press me to your heart
 And in a world apart
 A world where roses bloom
 
 And when you speak 
 Angels sing from above
 Every day words 
 Seems to turn into love songs
 
 Give your heart and soul to me
 And life will always be 
 La vie en rose
 
 Listen to my tale of woe
 It's terribly sad, but true
 All dressed up, no place to go
 Each evening I'm awfully blue
 
 I must win some handsome guy
 Can't go on like this
 I could blossom out I know
 With somebody just like you, so
 
 Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
 Oh, lady, be good to me
 I am so awfully misunderstood
 So, lady, be good to me
 
 Oh, please, have some pity
 I'm all alone in this big city
 I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
 So, lady, be good to me
 
 Oh, please, have some pity
 I'm all alone in this big city
 I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
 So, lady, be good to me
 Oh, lady, be good to me
 
 Lady sings the blues
 She's got them bad
 She feels so sad
 Wants the world to know
 Just what the blues is all about
 
 Lady sings the blues
 She tells her side
 Nothing to hide
 Now the world will now
 Just what the blues is all about
 The blues ain't nothing but a pain in your heart
 When you get a bad start
 When you and your man have to part
 I ain't gonna just sit around and cry
 And now I won't die
 Because I love him
 
 Lady sings the blues
 She's got 'em bad
 She feels so sad
 The world will know
 She's never gonna sing them no more
 
 No more
 
 The crowd sees me out dancing
 Carefree and romancing
 Happy with my someone new
 I'm laughing on the outside
 Crying on the inside
 'Cause I'm still in love with you
 
 They see me night and daytime
 Having such a gay time
 They don't know what I go through
 I'm laughing on the outside
 Crying on the inside
 'Cause I'm still in love with you
 
 No one knows it's just a pose
 Pretending I'm glad we're apart
 And when I cry, my eyes are dry
 The tears are in my heart
 
 My darling, can't we make up?
 Ever since our breakup
 Make believe is all I do
 I'm laughing on the outside
 Crying on the inside
 'Cause I'm still in love
 I am still in love with you
 
 Laura is the face in the misty lights
 Footsteps that you hear down the hall
 The laugh that floats on a summer night
 That you can never quite recall
 
 And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
 Those eyes how familiar they seem
 She gave your very first kiss to you
 That was Laura but she's only a dream
 
 And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
 Those eyes how familiar they seem
 She gave your very first kiss to you
 That was Laura but she's only a dream
 
 
 Blue sky, sunshine
 What a day to take a walk in the park
 Ice cream, daydream
 Till the sky becomes a blanket of stars
 
 What a day for a pickin' daisies
 And lots of red balloons
 And what a day for holdin' hands
 And bein' with you
 
 Lazy day just right for lovin' away
 Lazy day made for a stroll in the lane
 Baby you and me
 And a honey bee
 Lazy day, lazy day
 Lazy day for you and me
 
 Blue sky, sunshine
 Flowers bloomin', squirrels are sayin' hello
 Rowboats, bird notes
 People smilin' everywhere that we go
 
 What a day to be together
 And what a sky of blue
 And what a day for thinkin' right out loud
 I love you
 
 Lazy day just right for lovin' away
 Lazy day made for a stroll in the lane
 Baby you and me
 'Neath a shady tree
 Lazy day, lazy day
 Lazy day for you and me
 
 And what a day for thinkin' right out loud
 I love you
 
 Lazy day just right for lovin' away
 Lazy day made for a stroll in the lane
 Lazy day just right for lovin' away
 Lazy day
 
 The tables are empty
 The dance floor's deserted
 You play the same love song
 It's the tenth time you've heard it
 
 That's the beginning
 Just one of the clues
 You've had your first lesson
 In learnin' the Blues
 
 The cigarettes you light
 One after another
 Won't help you forget him
 And the way that you loved him
 
 You're only burning
 A torch you can't lose
 But you're on the right track
 For learnin' the blues
 
 When you're at home alone
 The Blues will taunt you constantly
 When you're out in a crowd
 The Blues will haunt your memory
 
 The nights when you don't sleep
 The whole night you're cryin'
 But you can't forget him
 Soon you even stop tryin'
 
 You walk the floor
 And wear out your shoes
 When you feel your heart break
 You're learnin' the blues
 
 Yes, the tables are empty
 The dance floor's deserted
 And you play the same love song, whoa, yes
 It's the tenth time you've heard it, yes
 
 Man, it's the beginnin'
 Just one of those clues
 You've had your first lesson, whoa, yes
 In learnin' the Blues
 
 Man, the cigarettes that you light, whoa, yessum
 One after another, you tellin' me brother
 Won't help you to forget her, whoa, no
 And the way that you love her
 
 You only burnin'
 A torch that you can't lose, yeah
 But you on the right tracks, brother
 For learnin' the blues
 
 D'ya see that Ella
 
 Now lookahere
 When you at home alone
 The blues will taunt you constantly, yessuh
 Ba dit dit deet
 And when you're out in a crowd
 The Blues will haunt your memories
 Bah da doh doh zet
 
 The nights when you don't sleep, yes
 The whole night you cryin'
 But you can't forget her, oh yes
 Soon you even stop tryin'
 
 Man, you walk the floor
 And wear out your shoes
 When you feel your heart break, yeah brother
 That's when you're learning the blues
 
 Yes
 When you at home alone
 The blues will taunt you constantly, yes
 And when you're out in a crowd
 The Blues will haunt your memories
 
 The nights when you don't sleep, hmm, Ella
 The whole night you're crying
 Yeah, but you can't forget her
 Soon you even stop trying
 
 Yes man, you'll walk the floor
 that's when it's rough
 And wear out that last pair a' treaders
 When you feel your heart break
 You're learnin the blues
 
 Oh, the weather outside is frightful
 But the fire is so delightful
 And since we've no place to go
 Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
 
 It doesn't show signs of stopping
 And I've bought some corn for popping
 The lights are turned way down low
 Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
 
 When we finally kiss goodnight
 How I'll hate going out in the storm
 But if you'll really hold me tight
 All the way home I'll be warm
 
 The fire is slowly dying
 And, my dear, we're still goodbying
 But as long as you love me so
 Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
 
 When we finally kiss goodnight
 How I'll hate going out in the storm
 But if you'll really hold me tight
 All the way home I'll be warm

 As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble? 
 As you listen to them play don't you get a glow? 
 If you step out on the floor
 You'll forget your trouble
 If you go into your dance
 You'll forget your woe
 So
 
 Come
 Get together
 Let the dance floor feel your leather
 Step as lightly as a feather
 Let yourself go
 
 Come
 Hit the timber
 Loosen up and start to limber
 Can't you hear that hot marimba? 
 Let yourself go
 
 Let yourself go
 Relax
 And let yourself go
 Relax
 You've got yourself tied up in a knot
 The night is cold but the music's hot
 So
 
 Come
 Cuddle closer
 Don't you dare to answer "no, sir"
 Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
 Let yourself go
 
 Before I met you no one attracted me
 No love thoughts worried or distracted me
 My disposition kept exempting me
 Until you started in preempting me
 
 And all this while, you've really been tempting me
 Maybe you can tell me what we ought to do
 
 Now that you've got me going, what you gonna do?
 Is it up to me? Is it up to you?
 What kind of game is this we've begun?
 Was it done, just for fun?
 
 We have necked, till I'm wrecked
 Won't you tell me what you expect?
 Is this to be a case of kiss and never tell?
 Folly and farewell
 Heaven or maybe hell
 
 Which is it going to be, love or gin?
 Wife or sin? Let's begin
 
 We have necked, till I'm wrecked
 Won't you tell me what you expect?
 Is this to be a case of kiss and never tell?
 Folly and farewell
 Heaven or maybe hell
 
 Which is it going to be, love or gin?
 Wife or sin? Let's begin
 
 Things have come to a pretty pass
 Our romance is growing flat
 For you like this and the other
 While I go for this and that
 
 Goodness knows what the end will be
 Oh I don't know where I'm at
 It looks as if we two will never be one
 Something must be done
 
 You say either and I say either
 You say neither and I say neither
 Either, either neither, neither
 Let's call the whole thing off
 
 You like potato and I like potahto
 You like tomato and I like tomahto
 Potato, potahto, tomato, tomahto
 Let's call the whole thing off
 
 But oh, if we call the whole thing off
 Then we must part
 And oh, if we ever part
 then that might break my heart
 
 So if you like pyjamas and I like pyjahmas
 I'll wear pyjamas and give up pyajahmas
 For we know we need each other so we
 Better call the whole thing off
 Let's call the whole thing off
 
 You say laughter and I say larfter
 You say after and I say arfter
 Laughter, larfter after arfter
 Let's call the whole thing off
 
 You like vanilla and I like vanella
 You saspiralla, and I saspirella
 Vanilla vanella chocolate strawberry
 Let's call the whole thing off
 
 But oh if we call the whole thing off
 then we must part
 And oh, if we ever part,
 then that might break my heart
 
 So if you go for oysters and I go for ersters
 I'll order oysters and cancel the ersters
 For we know we need each other so we
 Better call the calling off off
 Let's call the whole thing off
 
 You say either 
 You say neither 
 Either, , neither 
 Let's call the whole thing off
 
 You like potato 
 You like tomato 
 Potato , tomato 
 Let's call the whole thing off
 
 But oh, if we call the whole thing off
 Then we must part
 And oh, if we ever part
 then that might break my heart
 
 So if you like pyjamas 
 I'll wear pyjamas 
 For we know we need each other so we
 Better call the calling off off
 Let's call the whole thing off
 Let's call the whole thing off
 
 Birds do it, bees do it
 Even educated fleas do it
 Let's do it, let's fall in love
 
 In Spain, the best upper sets do it
 Lithuanians and Letts do it
 Let's do it, let's fall in love
 
 The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
 Not to mention the Finns
 Folks in Siam do it, think of Siamese twins
 
 Some Argentines without means do it
 People say in Boston even beans do it
 Let's do it, let's fall in love
 
 Romantic sponges, they say, do it
 Oysters down in oyster bay do it
 Let's do it, let's fall in love
 
 Cold cape cod clams 'gainst their wish do it
 Even lazy jellyfish do it
 Let's do it, let's fall in love
 
 Electric eels, I might add, do it
 Though it shocks 'em I know
 Why ask if shad do it?
 Waiter, bring me shad roe
 
 In shallow shoals English soles do it
 Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
 Let's do it, let's fall in love
 
 There may be trouble ahead
 But while there's music and moonlight  and love and romance
 Let's face the music and dance
 
 Before the fiddlers have fled
 Before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have that chance
 Let's face the music and dance
 
 Soon, we'll be without the moon
 Humming a different tune, and then
 
 There may be teardrops to shed
 So  while there's music and moonlight  and love and romance
 
 Let's face the music and dance
 
 I didn't mean to,
 Start any scene to
 Make you sigh
 Hope to die
 
 It's most immoral
 For us to quarrel
 Why can't we
 Both agree
 
 Don't you know Ben Franklin wrote about this thing at length?
 On the proposition that in union there is strength?
 Why raise a storm up
 If we'll just warm up
 
 The blues will slumber
 We'll have their number
 Let's kiss and make up
 Come on, let's wake up
 
 For I need you and you need me
 Let's kiss and make up
 No use to break up
 When we can live in harmony
 
 I'll give you your way
 You give me my way
 And out the doorway
 Our cares will fly away
 
 If we be happy
 The way is clear
 Let's kiss, and make up
 No use to break up
 
 We need each other, dear
 Let's kiss and make up
 No cares to rake up
 For I need you and you need me
 
 No reprimanding
 Full understanding
 That we can live in harmony
 The world is prose-why
 
 When we are fighting
 Lets make it rosy
 By reuniting
 Two heads are better
 
 Than what I hear
 Let's kiss and make up
 No use to break up
 We need each other, dear
 
 Why should we shake up
 A new earthquake-up
 Take the uptake-up
 And soon they'll bake-up
 
 A wedding cake-up
 Let's kiss and make up
 We need each other dear
 
 I never traveled further north than old Van Courtland park
 And never further south than the aquarium
 I've seen the charm of Jersey City, but first let me remark
 I saw it from the Empire State Solarium
 
 But we've been putting nickels in the postal savings bank
 And when those nickels pile up, we can toddle off in swank
 And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
 I mean a cabin deluxe tour
 
 Someday we'll go places
 New lands and new faces
 The day we quit punching the clock
 The future looks pleasant
 But at present
 Let's take a walk around the block
 
 You're just the companion
 I want at Grand Canyon
 For throwing old blades down the rock
 The money we have`ll go for travel
 Meantime, let's walk around the block
 
 Gangway, we'll begin
 When our, ship comes in
 I'll sit on your lap
 All over the map
 
 To London in may time
 To Venice in play time
 To Paris in time for a frock
 To Boston in bean time
 Darling, meantime
 Let's take a walk around the block
 
 In winter at Christmas
 We'll visit the isthmus
 And see how they lock up a lock
 And then in Caracas, on a jackass
 We'll take a ride around the block
 
 We'll keep to our promise
 To visit St. Thomas
 And then at Jamaica we'll dock
 The prospect is thrilling
 Still I am willing
 Just now to walk around the block
 
 Onward, to Cathay
 Then to Mandalay
 Boom on to Bangkok
 P'are'aps Vladivostok
 
 We'll send the folks cables
 Accumulate labels
 Buy souvenirs till we're in hock
 But since we are flat in old Manhattan
 Let's take a walk around the block
 
 Lately, I find myself gazing at stars
 Hearing guitars like someone in love
 Sometimes the things I do astound me
 Mostly whenever you're around me
 Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings
 Bump into things like someone in love
 Each time I look at you
 I'm limp as a glove
 And feeling like someone in love
 
 I'm out doin' the usual places
 And I'm livin' it, like young
 Then I dig me this face of all faces
 He's the craziest, like young
 
 He drinks coffee at Cafe Espresso
 He reads Kerouac, like young
 He goes where all the angry young men go
 Recites poetry, like young
 
 We start blowin' the pad around lovin'
 And we're homin' it, like now
 We spin records on cloud number seven
 And he's reachin' me, like wow
 
 I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
 He's got me feelin' like young
 If he were to brush me and go
 I'm starting to wear my hair again
 Like a square again
 
 I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
 I think maybe it's like love
 I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
 I think, baby, it's like love
 
 Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville
 And we're makin' it like young
 Love soft as April snow
 Love warm as candle glow
 Love, love is easy to go
 
 I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
 He's got me feelin' like young
 Without him I'm no good at all
 Without him I'm less than a decimal
 ?
 
 I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
 I think maybe it's like love
 I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
 I think, baby, it's like love
 
 Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville or Wowsville
 We're makin' it, makin' it like, like, like young
 
 Don't need no palace paved with gold
 Don't need more cash than banks can hold
 When I get to feelin', a feelin'
 For something there ain't too much of
 My sweet lil' darlin' gives me her love
 
 Don't catch me chasin' 'round at night
 I'm not impressed by glamor sights
 Lil' darlin' may not be as pretty 
 As some other gals you can see
 But my lil darlin' only loves me
 
 And those weird China blues
 Never go away
 Sad, mad blues
 For all the while they seem to say
 
 Oh, Limehouse kid
 Oh, oh, Limehouse kid
 Goin' the way
 That the rest of them did
 Poor broken blossom
 And nobody's child
 Haunting and taunting
 You're just kind of wild
 
 Oh, Limehouse blues
 I've the real Limehouse blues
 Can't seem to shake off
 Those real China blues
 Rings on your fingers
 And tears for your crown
 That is the story
 Of old Chinatown
 
 Rings on your fingers
 And tears for your crown
 That is the story
 Of old Chinatown
 
 When you were very young
 The world was younger than you
 As merry as a carousel
 
 The circus tent was thrilling
 With every star in the sky
 Above the rings you loved so well
 
 Now the young world has grown old
 Gone is the silver and gold
 
 Sit there, and count your fingers
 What can you do?
 Old girl you're through
 Just sit there, and count your little fingers
 Unhappy little girl blue
 
 Sit there, and count the raindrops
 Falling on you
 It's time you knew
 That all you can count on are the raindrops
 That fall on little girl blue
 
 No use, old girl
 You might as well surrender
 Your hopes are getting slender
 Why won't somebody send a tender little boy
 To cheer up little girl blue?
 
 The moon was all aglow
 But heaven was in your eyes
 The night that you told me
 Those little white lies
 
 The stars all seemed to know
 You didn't mean all those sighs
 The night that you told me
 Those little white lies
 
 I try, but there's no forgetting
 When evenin' appears
 I sigh but there's no regretting
 In spite of my tears
 
 Who wouldn't believe those lips
 Who wouldn't believe those eyes
 The night that you told me
 Those little white lies
 
 I try, but there's no forgetting
 When evenin' appears
 I sigh but there's no regretting
 In spite of my tears
 
 The Devil was in your heart
 But Heaven was in your eyes
 The night that you told me
 Those little white lies
 Those lies
 Teeny-weeny little white lies
 
 By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes
 Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond
 Where we two have passed so many blithesome days
 On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond
 
 O ye'll take the high road and I'll take the low road
 And I'll be in Scotland afore ye
 But me and my true love will never meet again
 On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond
 
 I mind where we parted on yon shady glen
 On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomond.
 Where in purple hue, the Heiland hills we view
 And the moon shinin' out from the gloamin'
 
 The wee bird may sing and the wild flowers spring
 And in sunshine the waters are sleeping
 The broken heart will ken nae second spring again
 And the world does not know how we're grievin'
 
 I am just a little girl
 Who's looking for a little boy
 Who's looking for a girl to love.
 
 Tell me please,
 Where can he be,
 The loving he who'll bring to me
 The harmony I'm dreaming of.
 
 It'll be goodbye, I know
 To my tale of woe,
 When he says "Hello!"
 
 So I am just a little girl
 Who's looking for a little boy
 Who's looking for a girl to love!
 
 Back in the days of knights in armor
 There once lived a lovely charmer
 Swimming in the Rhine
 Her figure was divine
 
 She had a yen for all the sailors
 Fishermen and gobs and whalers
 She had a most immoral eye
 They called her Lorelei
 
 She created quite a stir
 And I want to be like her
 
 I want to be like that gal on the river
 Who sang her song to the ships passing by
 She had the goods and how she could deliver
 The Lorelei
 
 She used to love in a strange kind of fashion
 With lots of hey-ho-de-ho-hi-de-hi
 And I can guarantee I`m full of passion
 Like the Lorelei
 
 I`m treacherous, yeah-yeah
 Oh, I just can`t hold myself in check
 I`m lecherous, yeah-yeah
 I want to bite my initials on a sailor`s neck
 
 Each affair has a kick and a wallop
 For what they crave, I can always supply
 I want to be just like that other trollop
 The Lorelei
 
 I want to be just like that other trollop
 The Lorelei
 
 Like a ship at sea, I'm just lost in a fog
 My mind is hazy, my thoughts are blue
 Guess I'll always be kinda
 Lost in a fog without you
 
 Waitin' night and day like a bump on a log
 I'm goin' crazy; what can I do?
 Help me find my way
 'Cause I'm lost in a fog without you
 
 It was sunny every day
 The sky was fair above
 But you took the light away
 The day you took your love
 
 Only fools like me could be tossed in a bog
 I've got a heartache I never knew
 Guess I'll always be kinda
 Lost in a fog without you
 
 Like a ship at sea, I'm lost in a fog
 My mind is hazy, my thoughts are blue
 Guess I'll always be kinda
 Lost in a fog without you
 
 It was sunny every day
 The sky was fair above
 But you took the light away
 The day you took your love
 
 Only fools like me could be tossed in a bog
 I've got a heartache I never knew
 Guess I'll always be kinda
 Lost in a fog without you
 
 I am lost in meditation
 And my reverie
 Brings you back to me
 For, in my imagination
 Love has lingered on
 As though you`d never gone
 
 This is just a dream that can not last
 When the magic of this mood has passed
 So, I sit in meditation
 Trying to pretend, this mood will never end
 
 Lost in meditation
 And my reverie
 Brings you back to me
 
 Love and kisses
 Never misses
 Making a heaven for two
 With a tender
 Sweet surrender
 Coming from someone like you
 
 Your perfection
 To affection
 Creates a perfect design
 Love has bound us
 Joy has found us
 Planning a future divine
 
 No indecision
 I know that my vision
 Is clear
 When you are near
 No need for sunlight
 For you are the one light
 I see
 So real to me
 
 Love and kisses
 That's what bliss is
 Lighting whatever you do
 Whole completeness
 Blessed sweetness
 Coming from someone like you
 
 When the only sound in the empty street
 Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
 That belongs to a lonesome cop
 I open shop
 
 When the moon so long has been gazing down
 On the wayward ways of this wayward town
 That her smile becomes a smirk
 I go to work
 
 Love for sale
 Appetizing young love for sale
 Love that`s fresh and still unspoiled
 Love that`s only slightly soiled
 
 Love for sale
 Who will buy?
 Who would like to sample my supply?
 Who`s prepared to pay the price
 For a trip to paradise?
 Love for sale
 
 Let the poets pipe of love
 In their childish way
 I know every type of love
 Better far than they
 If you want the thrill of love
 I`ve been through the mill of love
 Old love, new love
 Every love but true love, love for sale
 
 Appetizing young love for sale

 Follow me and climb the stairs

 It's very clear our love is here to stay
 Not for a year, but ever and a day
 The radio and the telephone
 And the movies that we know
 May just be passing fancies
 And in time may go
 
 But, oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
 Together we're going a long, long way
 In time the Rockies may crumble
 Gibraltar may tumble
 They're only made of clay
 But our love is here to stay
 
 But, oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
 Together we're going a long, long way
 In time the Rockies may crumble
 Gibraltar may tumble
 They're only made of clay
 But our love is here to stay
 It's here to stay
 It's here to stay
 It's here to stay
 
 Why are people gay
 All the night and day
 Feeling as they never felt before
 What is the thing
 That makes them sing?
 
 Rich man, poor man, thief
 Doctor, lawyer, chief
 Feel a feeling that they can`t ignore
 
 It plays a part in every heart
 And every heart is shouting, "Encore"
 
 Love is sweeping the country,
 Waves are hugging the shore,
 All the sexes
 From Maine to Texas
 Have never known such love before!
 
 See them billing and cooing
 Like the birdies above
 Each girl and boy alike
 Sharing joy alike
 Feels that passion` ll
 Soon be national!
 
 Love is sweeping the country
 There never was so much love
 
 See them billing and cooing
 Like the birdies above
 Each girl and boy alike
 Sharing joy alike
 Feels that passion` ll
 Soon be national!
 
 Love is sweeping the country
 There never was so much love
 
 Love me or leave me or let me be lonely
 You won't believe me and I love you only
 I'd rather be lonely
 Than happy with somebody else
 
 You might find the night time
 The right time for kissin'
 But night time is my time for just reminiscin'
 Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else
 
 There'll be no one unless
 That someone is you
 I intend to be independently blue
 
 I want your love, but I don't want to borrow
 To have it today and you give back tomorrow
 For my love is your love
 There's no love for nobody else
 
 There'll be no one unless
 That someone is you
 I intend to be independently blue
 
 I want your love, but I don't want to borrow
 To have it today and you give back tomorrow
 For my love is your love
 There's no love for nobody else
 Nobody else, nobody else
 
 Love walked right in, and drove the shadows away
 Love walked right in, and brought my sunniest day
 One magic moment, and my heart seemed to know - that love said hello
 Though not a word was spoken
 One look, and I'd forgot the gloom of the past
 One look, and I had found my future at last
 One look, and I had found a world completely new
 When love walked in with you
 
 Love you madly
 Right or wrong
 Sounds like a lyric of a song
 But since it's so
 I thought you oughta know
 I love you, love you madly
 
 Better fish are in the sea
 Is not the theory for me
 And that's for sure
 Just like I said before
 I love you, love you madly
 
 If you could see the happy you and me
 I dream about so proudly
 You'd know the breath of spring
 That makes me sing
 My love song so loudly
 
 Good things come to those who wait
 So just relax and wait for fate
 To let me see the day you'll say to me
 I love you, love you madly
 
 But since it's so
 I thought you oughta know
 I love you, madly
 
 And that's for sure
 Just like I said before
 I love you, love you madly
 
 If you could see the happy you and me
 I dream about so proudly
 You'd know the breath of spring
 That makes me sing
 My love song so loudly
 
 To let me see the day you'll say to me
 I love you madly
 
 Love you madly
 Right or wrong

 I thought you oughta know
 I love you, madly

 So just relax and wait for fate
 To let me see the day you'll say to me
 I love you, love you madly
 
 I love you
 Love you madly
 I love you madly
 Oh, I got big eyes for you, baby
 
 Wait till you see him
 See how he looks
 Wait till you hear him laugh.
 
 Painters of paintings
 Writers of books
 Never could tell the half.
 
 Wait till you feel
 The warmth of his glance,
 Pensive and sweet and wise.
 
 All of it lovely
 All of it thrilling
 I'll never be willing to free him.
 
 When you see him
 You won't believe your eyes
 You won't believe your eyes.
 
 We can't go on this way,
 Laughing at love, day after day,
 I'm sincere, you're unfair,
 We can't go on this way.
 
 "It's all in fun" you say,
 After it's done, someone must pay,
 Then there'll be, so much misery, 
 We can't go on this way.
 
 Hiding behind a mask of laughters,
 It won't wipe away the curse,
 Even though it's fun we're after,
 I'll take you sweetheart, 
 For better or worse.
 
 If you would only say,
 "Yes it's OK, let's name the day,"
 Might as well, love will tell,
 We can't go on this way.

 I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
 I long to try something I've never had
 Never had no kissin'
 Oh, what I've been missin'
 Lover man, oh, where can you be? 
 
 The night is so cold and I'm so alone
 I'd give my soul just to call you my own
 Got a moon above me
 But no one to love me
 Lover man, oh, where can you be? 
 
 I've heard it said
 That the thrill of romance
 Can be like a heavenly dream
 I go to bed with a prayer
 That you'll make love to me
 Strange as it seems
 
 Someday we'll meet
 And you'll dry all my tears
 And whisper sweet
 Little things in my ear
 A-hugging and a-kissing
 Ooh, what we've been missing
 Lover man, oh, where can you be?
 Lover man, where can 
 You be
 
 Oh, lullaby of Birdland whisper low
 Always here, when you sigh,
 Never in my woodland could there be words to reveal
 In a phrase how i feel.
 
 Have you ever heard two turtle doves
 Bill and coo when they love?
 That's the kind of magic music we get from our lips
 When we kiss
 
 And there's a weepy old willow
 He really knows how to cry
 That's how i'd cry in my pillow
 If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
 
 Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
 Kiss me sweet, then we'll go
 Flying high in Birdland, high in the sky up above
 All because we're in love
 
 Lullaby, lullaby
 Have you ever heard two turtle doves
 Bill and coo when they love?
 That's the kind of magic music we get from our lips
 When we kiss
 
 And there's a weepy old willow
 He really knows how to cry
 That's how I'd cry in my pillow
 If you should tell me farewell and goodbye
 
 Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
 Kiss me sweet, then we'll go
 Flying high in Birdland, high in the sky up above
 And it's all because we're in love
 
 Come along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway,
 The hip-hooray and ballyhoo, the lullaby of Broadway.
 The rumble of a subway train, the rattle of the taxis,
 The daffodils who entertain at Angelo's and Maxie's.
 
 When a Broadway Baby says goodnight, it's early in the morning,
 Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn,
 Goodnight, baby, goodnight, milkman's on his way.
 Sleep tight, baby, sleep tight, let's call it a day.
 Listen to the lullaby of Broadway.
 
 Rustling of the leaves used to be my lullaby
 In the sunny South when I was a tot so high
 And now that I have grown
 And myself alone
 
 Cradle me where Southern skies
 Can watch me with a million eyes
 Sing me to sleep
 Lullaby of the leaves
 
 Cover me with Heaven's blue
 And let me dream a dream or two
 Sing me to sleep
 Lullaby of the leaves
 
 I'm breezing along, along with the breeze
 I'm hearing a song, a song through the trees
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 That fine melody caressing the shore
 Familiar to me, I've heard it before
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that's Southland
 
 Don't I feel it in my soul
 And don't I know I've reached my goal
 Sing me to sleep
 Lullaby of the leaves
 
 I used to visit all the very gay places
 Those come-what-may places
 Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
 To get the feel of life
 From jazz and cocktails
 
 The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
 With distinguish traces
 That used to be there
 You could see where they'd been washed away
 By too many through the day
 Twelve o'clock tales
 
 Then you came along with your siren song
 To tempt me to madness
 I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
 Was tinged with the sadness
 Of a great love for me
 Ah yes, I was wrong
 Again, I was wrong
 
 Life is lonely again
 And only last year
 Everything seemed so sure
 Now life is awful again
 A trough full of hearts could only be a bore
 
 A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
 All I care is to smile in spite of it
 
 I'll forget you, I will
 While yet you are still
 Burning inside my brain
 Romance is mush
 Stifling those who strive
 So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
 And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
 Of those whose lives are lonely too
 
 Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
 And it shows them pearly white
 Just a jackknife has old MacHeath, babe
 And he keeps it, ah, out of sight
 Ya know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
 Scarlet billows start to spread
 Fancy gloves, oh, wears old MacHeath, babe
 So there's never, never a trace of red
 
 Now on the sidewalk, huh, huh, whoo sunny morning, un huh
 Lies a body just oozin' life, eek
 And someone's sneakin' 'round the corner
 Could that someone be Mack the Knife'
 
 There's a tugboat, huh, huh, down by the river dontcha know
 Where a cement bag's just a'drooppin' on down
 Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
 Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town
 Now d'ja hear 'bout Louie Miller' He disappeared, babe
 After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
 And now MacHeath spends just like a sailor
 Could it be our boy's done somethin' rash'
 
 Now Jenny Diver, ho, ho, yeah, Sukey Tawdry
 Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
 Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
 Now that Macky's back in town
 
 I said Jenny Diver, whoa, Sukey Tawdry
 Look out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
 Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
 Now that Macky's back in town
 Look out, old Macky's back!!
 
 Instead of making conversation
 Make love to me
 Make love to me, my darling
 While there is still a moon
 
 Must I extend an invitation?
 Make love to me
 Make love to me, my darling
 Tonight will end so soon
 
 There are moments when my lips adore addressing you
 But tonight my lips are only for caressing you
 How about you?
 
 Before the mood that I'm in changes
 Make love to me
 Make love to me, my darling
 I'm so in love with you
 
 Must I extend an invitation
 To make love to me?
 Make love to me, my darling
 Tonight will end so soon
 
 There are moments when my lips, my lips adore addressing you
 But tonight my lips are only for caressing you
 But how about you?
 
 Don't let the mood I'm in change
 Make love to me
 Make love to me, my darling
 I'm so in love with you
 
 Make me rainbows
 Make me spring in the snow
 Make me beautiful music wherever I go
 
 Make me unwind
 Leave behind rhyme or reason
 Make me a room where I'll bloom out of season
 
 Make me sunsets
 Paint our names in the sky
 Let your arms be my wings and together we'll fly
 Don't let me fall till I'm all I can be
 
 Make me some rainbows
 Star-spangled rainbows
 Please, make those rainbows for me
 
 Make me unwind
 Leave behind rhyme or reason
 Make me a room where I'll bloom out of season
 
 Make me sunsets
 Paint our names in the sky
 Let your arms be my wings and together we'll fly
 Don't let me fall till I'm all I can be
 
 Make me some rainbows
 Star-spangled rainbows
 Please, make some rainbows for me
 
 Make those rainbows
 Star-spangled rainbows
 Please, make some rainbows for me
 
 Make some rainbows
 Star-spangled rainbows
 Please, make some rainbows for me
 
 Another bride, another June
 Another sunny honeymoon
 Another season, another reason
 For makin' whoopee
 
 A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
 The groom is nervous; he answers twice
 It's really killin'
 That he's so willin' to make whoopee
 
 Picture a little love nest
 Down where the roses cling
 Picture the same sweet love nest
 Think what a year can bring
 
 He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
 He's so ambitious he even sews
 But don't forget, folks
 That's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee
 
 Another year or maybe less
 What's this I hear? Well, you can't confess
 She feels neglected, and he's suspected
 Of makin' whoopee
 
 She sits alone 'most every night
 He doesn't phone her; he doesn't write
 He says he's busy, but she says, "Is he?"
 He's makin' whoopee
 
 He doesn't make much money
 Only five thousand per
 Some judge who thinks he's funny
 Says, "You'll pay six to her"
 
 He says, "Now, Judge, suppose I fail?"
 The judge says, "Budge right into jail"
 You'd better keep her; I think it's cheaper
 Than makin' whoopee
 
 You'd better keep her
 I know it's cheaper
 Than makin' whoopee
 
 Summer journeys to Niagara and to other places
 Aggravate all our cares, we'll save our fares
 I've a cozy little flat in what is known as old Manhattan
 We'll settle down right here in town
 
 We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island too
 It's lovely going through the zoo
 It's very fancy on old Delancy Street, you know
 The subway charms us so, when balmy breezes blow to and fro
 
 And tell me what street compares with Mott Street in July?
 Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by
 The great big city's a wondrous toy just made for a girl and boy
 We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy
 
 We'll go to Yonkers where true love conquers in the whiles
 And starve together, dear, in Chiles
 We'll go to Coney and eat baloney on a roll
 In Central Park we'll stroll, where our first kiss we stole, soul to soul
 
 And "My Fair Lady" is a terrific show, they say
 We both may see it close some day
 The city's glamor can never spoil the dreams of a boy and goil
 We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy
 
 
 Ah, it's a marshmallow world in the winter,
 When the snow comes to cover the ground.
 It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day,
 I wait for it the whole year round!
 
 Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly,
 In the arms of the evergreen trees,
 And the sun is red like a pumpkin head,
 It's shining so your nose won't freeze!
 
 The world is your snowball, see how it grows,
 That's how it goes, whenever it snows.
 The world is your snowball just for a song,
 Get out and roll it along!
 
 It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,
 Take a walk with your favorite girl.
 It's a sugar date, so what if spring is late,
 In winter it's a marshmallow world!
 
 It's a marshmallow day in the winter,
 When the snow comes to cover the ground.
 It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day,
 And we wait for it the whole year round!
 
 Just you remember that
 
 Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly,
 In the arms of the evergreen trees,
 And the sun is red like a pumpkin head,
 It's shining so your nose won't freeze!
 
 You must remember that
 
 The world is your snowball, see how it grows,
 That's how it goes whenever it snows.
 The world is your snowball just for a song,
 Get out and roll it along!
 
 It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts,
 Take a walk with your favorite girl.
 It's a sugary date, so what if spring is late,
 In winter it's a marshmallow world
 In winter it's a marshmallow world
 In winter it's a marshmallow world
 
 Oari rai
 Ob Ob Ob
 Mas que nada
 Sai da minha frente
 Eu quero passar
 Pois o samba est animado
 O que eu quero sambar
 Este samba
 Que misto de maracatu
 samba de preto velho
 Samba de preto tu
 Mas que nada
 Um samba como esse to legal
 Voc no vai querer
 Que eu chegue no final
 
 Maybe you'll think of me
 When you are all alone
 Maybe the one who is waiting for you will prove untrue
 Then what will you do
 Maybe you'll sit and sigh
 Wishing that I were near, then
 Maybe you'll ask me to come back again
 And maybe I'll say maybe
 
 May be you'll think of me
 When you are all alone
 Maybe the one who is waiting for you will prove untrue
 Then what will you do
 Maybe you'll sit and sigh
 Wishing that I were near, then
 Maybe you'll ask me to come back again
 And maybe I'll say maybe
 
 
 You're mean to me
 Why must you be mean to me?
 Gee, honey, it seems to me
 You love to see me cryin'
 I don't know why
 I stay home each night
 When you say you phone
 You don't and I'm left alone.
 
 Sing the blues and sighin'
 You treat me coldly each day in the year
 You always scold me
 Whenever somebody is near, dear
 I must be great fun to be mean to me
 You shouldn't, for can't you see
 What you mean to me
 
 Melancholy me
 Melancholy over you
 All alone and feelin' blue
 Are you melancholy too?
 
 Miss you every day
 Ever since you went away
 Melancholy over you
 Are you melancholy too?
 
 While each minute seems
 Like hours to me
 Each hour seems like years
 Each day is an eternity
 Of sadness and tears
 
 All I do is yearn
 Though I know you'll soon return
 But until you do, I'll be
 Just a melancholy me
 
 While each minute seems
 Like hours to me
 Each hour seems like years
 Each day is an eternity
 Of sadness and tears
 
 All I do is yearn
 Though I know you'll soon return
 But until you do, I'll be
 Just a melancholy me
 
 Waking skies
 At Sunrise
 Every sunset too
 Seems to be
 Bringing me
 Memories of you
 
 Here and there
 Everywhere
 Scenes that we once knew
 And they all
 Just recall
 Memories of you
 
 How I wish I could forget
 Those happy yesteryears
 That have left a rosary of tears
 
 Your face beams
 In my dreams
 Spite of all I do
 Everything
 Seems to bring
 Memories of you
 
 How I wish I could forget
 Those happy yesteryears
 That have left a rosary of tears
 
 Your face beams
 In my dreams
 Spite of all I do
 Everything
 Seems to bring
 Memories
 All those memories of you
 
 Folks I've just been down, down to Memphis town,
 That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while.
 Hospitality, they were good to me.
 I couldn't spend a dime, and had the grandest time.
 I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear,
 They had a fellow there named Handy with a band you should hear
 And while the folks gently swayed, all the band folks played Real harmony.
 I never will forget the tune that Handy called the Memphis Blues.
 Oh yes, them Blues.
 
 They've got a fiddler there that always slickens his hair
 And folks he sure do pull some bow.
 And when the big Bassoon seconds to the Trombones croon.
 It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day, on Revival Day.
 
 Oh that melody sure appealed to me.
 Just like a mountain stream rippling on it seemed.
 Then it slowly died, with a gentle sigh
 Soft as the breeze that whines high in the summer pines.
 Hear me people, hear me people, hear I pray,
 I'm going to take a million lesson's 'til I learn how to play
 Because I seem to hear it yet, simply can't forget
 That blue refrain.
 
 There's nothing like the Handy Band that played the Memphis Blues so grand.
 Oh play them Blues.
 That melancholy strain, that ever haunting refrain
 Is like a sweet old sorrow song.
 Here comes the very part that wraps a spell around my heart.
 It sets me wild to hear that loving tune a gain, the Memphis Blues.
 
 Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
 The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
 Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
 I could see the midnight sun.
 
 I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
 The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
 And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
 I could see the midnight sun.
 
 Was there such a night, it's a thrill I still don't quite believe,
 But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.
 
 The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
 And we may see the meadow in December, icy white and crystalline.
 But oh my darling always I'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
 And we saw the midnight sun.
 
 Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
 Madam
 Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
 She is sorry to be delayed
 But last evening down in Lover's Lane she strays
 Madam
 Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
 
 When she woke up and found that her dream of love was gone
 Madam
 She ran to the man who had led her so far astray
 And from under her velvet gown
 She drew a gun and shot her love down
 Madam
 Miss Otis regrets, she's unable to lunch today
 
 When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail
 Madam
 They strung her upon the old willow across the way
 And the moment before she died
 She lifted up her lovely head and cried
 Madam
 Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
 
 Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
 
 Look at me 
 I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
 And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
 I can't understand
 I get misty, just holding your hand
 
 Walk my way
 And a thousand violins begin to play
 Or it might be the sound of your hello
 That music I hear
 I get misty whenever you're near
 
 Don't you know that you're leading me on? 
 And it's just what I want you to do
 Can't you see that I'm hopelessly lost?
 That's why I'm following you
 
 On my own
 When I wander through this wonderland alone
 Never knowing my right foot from my left
 My hat from my glove
 I'm too misty, and too much in love
 
 Too misty
 And too much
 Too much in love
 
 Oh, Its, been such a long long time
 Looks like I got you off of my mind
 But I can't, just the thought of you
 Turns my whole world misty blue
 
 Oh honey, just the mention of your name
 Turns a flicker to a flame
 Listen to me good baby
 I think of the things we used to do
 And my whole world turns misty blue
 
 Ohhhh, baby I should forget you
 Heaven knows I've tried
 Baby, when I said that I'm glad we're through
 Deep in my heart I know I've
 lied, I've lied, I've lied
 
 Oh, Its, been such a long long time
 Looks like I got you off of my mind
 But I can't, just the thought of you
 Turns my whole world misty blue
 
 Ohhhhhhh, no I can't no I can't
 I can't forget you
 My whole world turns misty blue
 
 Ohhhh My love
 My whole world turns misty blue
 
 Baby  I should forget you
 My whole world turns misty blue
 
 Ohhhh My love
 My whole world turns misty blue
 
 Baby, baby I should forget you
 Misty blue
 
 I have mixed emotions
 when it comes to loving you
 I know I shouldn't like the things you shouldn't do
 but if you were perfect
 it wouldnt be the same
 to a tiger a tiger's not a tiger if he's tame
 
 but when you're near me I am happy just alone with you
 but when you're far away from me I'm awfully blue
 you're the bitter and the sweet combined
 so what am I to do
 I have mixed emotions over you

 Moanin' low, my sweet man; I love him so
 Though he's mean as can be
 He's the kind of man needs the kind
 Of a woman like me
 
 Gonna die if my sweet man should pass me by
 If I die, where'll he be?
 He's the kind of a man needs the kind
 Of a woman like me
 
 Don't know any reason why
 He treats me so poorly
 What have I gone and done
 Makes my troubles double with his worries
 When surely I ain't deserving of none
 
 Moanin' low
 My sweet man is gonna go
 When he goes, oh Lordy
 He's the kind of a man needs the kind
 Of a woman like me

 You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
 You ain't never been blue, 
 Till you've had that mood indigo. 
 That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
 While I just sit here and sigh, "Go 'long blues".
 
 I always get that mood indigo, 
 Since my baby said goodbye. 
 And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
 I'm so lonely I could cry. 
 'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
 I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
 When I get that mood indigo, 
 I could lay me down and die. 
 
 You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
 You ain't never been blue, 
 Till you've had that mood indigo. 
 That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
 While I just sit here and sigh, "Go 'long blues".
 
 Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair
 You certainly know the right thing to wear
 Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
 And I could get so romantic tonight
 You're all dressed up to go dreaming
 Now don't tell me I'm wrong
 And what a night to go dreaming
 Mind if I tag along
 If I say I love you
 I want you to know
 It's not just because there's moonlight
 Although, moonlight becomes you so
 
 You're all dressed up to go dreaming
 Now don't tell me I'm wrong
 And what a night to go dreaming
 Mind if I tag along
 If I say I love you
 I want you to know
 It's not just because there's moonlight
 Although, moonlight becomes you so
 
 Ella:
 Pennies in a stream
 Falling leaves of a sycamore
 Moonlight in Vermont
 
 Icey finger waves
 Ski trails on a mountain side
 Snowlight in Vermont
 
 Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
 And travel each bend in the road
 People who meet, in this romantic setting
 Are so hypnotized by the lovely...
 
 Evening summer breeze
 Warbling of a meadowlark
 Moonlight in Vermont

 Moonlight on the Ganges, my little Hindu
 When I whispered love's sweet melody
 All our dreams and our schemes came true
 Someday on the Ganges, I'll need you once more
 And I'll kiss you and caress you
 Where the waters kiss the silent shore
 
 Moonlight on the Ganges, my little Hindu

 Moonray
 Cast your spell upon my lover
 Under this starlit cover
 Use all your magic charms
 
 Oh, moonray
 Let your sweet enchantment blind you
 Then I shall wait to find you
 Here in my lonely arms
 
 Once we knew the joy
 Of girl in love with boy
 But he made a toy of romance
 
 So, moonray
 Put an end to all my sorrows
 Bless me with sweet tomorrows
 Bring back my love to me
 
 Once we knew the joy

 Oh, sunrays, moonrays
 Bring back my love to me
 
 Whether you are here or yonder, 
 Whether you are false or true
 Whether you remain or wander, 
 I'm growing fonder of you
 Even though your friends forsake you, 
 Even though you don't succeed
 Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
 Give you the break you need
 
 More than you know, more than you know
 Girl of my heart, I love you so
 Lately I find you're on my mind
 More than you know
 
 Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
 Girl of my heart, I'll string along
 You need me so
 Much more than you'll ever know         
 Loving you the way that I do      
 
 There's nothing I can do about it        
 Loving may be all you can give        
 But baby I can't live without it
 Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
 If you got tired and said "Good-bye"
 
 More than I'd show
 More than you'd ever know
 
 On the first of may, it is moving day,
 Spring is here, so blow your job,
 Throw your job away!
 
 Now's the time to trust,
 To your wanderlust,
 In the city's dust you wait, must you wait
 Just you wait.......!
 
 In a mountain greenery,
 Where god paints the scenery
 Just two crazy people together.
 
 While you love your lover,
 Let blue skies, be your cover-let,
 When it rains we'll laugh at the weather.
 
 And if you're good,
 I'll search for wood,
 So you can cook... while i stand look-in'
 
 Beans could get no keener reception in a beanery
 Bless our mountain greenery home!
 
 Mosquitoes here,
 Won't bite you dear,
 I'll let them sting, me on the finger!
 
 We could find no cleaner retreat from life's machinery
 Then our mountain greenery home.
 
 Once I visited my cousin, in Milwaukee, USA
 She got boyfriends by the dozen, when she sang in a lowdown way
 She was a positive sensation
 The songs that she sang would never miss
 My cousin was my inspiration
 That`s how I got like this
 
 I got a cousin in Milwaukee
 She`s got a voice so squawky
 And though she`s tall and kind of gawky
 Oh, how she gets the men
 
 Her singing isn`t operatic
 It`s got a lot of static
 What makes your heart get acrobatic
 Nine times out of ten
 
 When she sings hot, you can`t be solemn
 It sends the shivers up and down your spinal column
 When she sings blue, the men shout, "What stuff!"
 That baby is hot stuff
 
 So if you like the way I sing songs,
 If you think that I`m a wow
 You can thank my squawky cousin from Milwaukee
 Because she taught me how
 
 When she sings hot, you can`t be solemn
 It sends the shivers up and down your spinal column
 When she sings blue, the men shout, "What stuff!"
 That baby is hot stuff
 
 So if you like the way I sing songs,
 If you think that I`m a wow
 You can thank my squawky cousin from Milwaukee
 Because she taught me how
 
 My Funny Valentine
 Sweet comic valentine
 You make me smile with my heart
 Your looks are laughable
 unphotographable
 yet your my favorite work of art
 
 Is your Figure less than Greek?
 Is your mouth a little week?
 When you open it  to speak
 Are you smart?
 
 But don't change your hair for me
 Not if you care for me
 Stay little valentine stay
 Each day is Valentines day
 
 Is your figure less than Greek
 is your mouth a little weak
 When you open it to Speak
 Are you smart
 
 But don't change your hair for me
 Not if you care for me
 Stay little valentine stay
 Each day is valentines day
 
 Evening shadows make me blue
 When each weary day is through
 How I long to be with you
 My happiness
 
 Every day I reminisce
 Dreaming of your tender kiss
 Always thinking how I miss
 My happiness
 
 A million years it seems
 Have gone by since we shared our dreams
 But I'll hold you again
 There'll be no blue memories then
 
 Whether skies are gray or blue
 Any place on earth will do
 Just as long as I'm with you
 My happiness
 
 Evening shadows make me blue
 When each weary day is through
 How I long to be with you
 My happiness
 
 Every day I reminisce
 Dreaming of your tender kiss
 Always thinking how I miss
 My happiness

 Have gone by since we shared our dreams
 But I'll hold you again
 There'll be no blue memories then
 
 Whether skies are gray or blue
 Any place on earth will do
 Just as long as I'm with you
 My happiness
 
 My heart and I decided
 If you like it, we'd like it too
 Secluded with you
 
 My heart and I decided
 We'd find heaven, blue heaven too
 Secluded with you
 
 Up on the Prairie or out on a desert
 Where tumbleweeds stumble around
 High on a mountain or deep in a valley
 Or some little alley in town
 
 My heart and I decided
 It's just too, too good to be true
 Secluded with you
 
 My heart and I decided
 We'd find heaven, blue heaven too
 Secluded with you
 
 Up on the Prairie or out on a desert
 Where tumbleweeds stumble around
 High on a mountain or deep in a valley
 Or some little alley in town
 
 My heart and I decided
 It's just too, too good to be true
 When I'm secluded with you
 
 I used to fall
 In love with all
 Those boys who call
 On young cuties
 But now I find
 I'm all inclined
 To keep my mind
 On my duties
 Since I've begun to share
 In such a sweet love affair
 
 Though I'm in love, I'm not above
 A date with a duke or a caddie
 It's just a pose, 'cause my baby knows
 That my heart belongs to daddy
 
 When some good scout, invites me out
 To dine om some fine fin and haddie
 My baby's sure, his love is secure
 Cause my heart belongs to daddy
 
 Yes my heart belongs to daddy
 So I simply couldn't be bad
 Yes I'm gonna marry daddy
 Dad
 If you feel romantic laddy
 Let me warn you right from the start
 That my heart belongs to daddy
 And my daddy belongs to my heart
 
 I laughed at sweethearts I met at schools
 All indiscreet hearts Seemed romantic fools
 A house in Iceland was my heart`s domain
 I saw your eyes, now castles rise in Spain!
 
 I took one look at you, that`s all I meant to do
 And then my heart stood still,
 My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
 And yet my heart stood still
 
 Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
 That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
 I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when
 My heart stood still
 
 Through all my school days, I hated boys
 Those April Fool days brought me loveless joys
 I read my Plato, Love, I thought a sin
 But since your kiss, I`m reading Missus Glyn!
 
 My kinda love, your kinda love
 Keeps me believing although you're deceiving
 My kinda love, one way to paradise
 
 My kinda lips, your kinda lips
 When love comes stealing, encourage that feeling
 My kinda love, one way to paradise
 
 Although you're happy today
 You may be gone tomorrow
 Love comes but once; don't be a dunce
 When you need it, steal it, beg or borrow
 
 I'm fond of you, you're fond of me
 Tell me you love me and hug me and squeeze me
 My kinda love, one way to paradise
 
 Although you're happy today
 You may be gone tomorrow
 Love comes but once; don't be a dunce
 When you need it, beg or steal or borrow
 
 I'm fond of you, you're fond of me
 Tell me you love me and hug me and squeeze me
 My kinda love, one way to paradise
 
 Can't you see
 What love and romance have done to me?
 I'm not the same as I used to be
 This is my last affair
 
 Tragedy
 Just seems to be the end of me
 My happiness is misery
 This is my last affair
 
 Right from the start you took my love
 Tore my heart apart
 Now there's nothing new to look forward to
 My dreams won't come true
 
 So I'll make a vow
 No more to love's shrine will I bow
 I've crossed my heart and I'll seal it now
 This is my last affair
 
 I say, tragedy
 Just seems to be the end of me
 My happiness is misery
 This is my last affair
 
 Right from the start you took my love
 Tore my heart apart
 Now there's nothing new to look forward to
 My dreams won't come true
 
 So I'll make a vow
 No more to love's shrine will I bow
 I've crossed my heart and I'll seal it now
 This is my last affair
 This is my last affair
 
 It's cost me a lot
 But there's one thing that I've got 
 It's my man
 Cold and wet, tired you bet
 But all that I soon forget 
 With my man
 He's not much for looks 
 And no hero out of books 
 Is my man
 Two or three girls has he 
 That he likes as well as me
 But I love him! 
 I don't know why I should
 He isn't good, he isn't true
 He beats me too
 What can I do?
 
 Oh, my man I love him so
 He'll never know
 All my life is just despair
 But I don't care 
 When he takes me in his arms 
 The world is bright, all right
 What's the difference if I say
 I'll go away, When I know
 I'll come back on my knees some day?
 For whatever my man is 
 I am his forever more
 Oh, my man I love him
 
 Sometimes I say 
 If I could just get away 
 With my man
 He'd go straight sure as fate
 For it never is too late
 For a man
 I just like to dream 
 Of a cottage by a stream 
 With my man
 Where a few flowers grew
 And perhaps a kid or two
 Like my man
 And then my eyes get wet
 I most forget till he gets hot
 And tells me not to talk such rot
 
 Oh, my man I love him so
 He'll never know
 All my life is just despair
 But I don't care 
 When he takes me in his arms 
 The world is bright, all right
 What's the difference if I say 
 I'll go away, When I know
 I'll come back on my knees some day?
 For what ever my man is 
 I am his forever more
 
 My man's gone now
 Ain't no use a listenin'
 For his tired footsteps
 Climbin' up the stairs
 Old man sorrow's
 Come to keep me company
 Whisperin' beside me
 When I say my prayers
 When I say my prayers
 He come aroud
 He come up, he come around
 Ain't that I mind workin'
 Workin' means travelers
 Journeyin' togheter
 To the promised land
 But old man sorrow
 Mountin' all the way with me
 Tell' me that I'm old now
 Since I lose my man
 Since I lose my man
 Since I lose my man
 
 Come to me, my melancholy baby
 Cuddle up and don't be blue
 All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe
 You know, dear, that I'm in love with you
 
 Every cloud must have a silver lining
 Wait until the sun shines through
 
 Cuddle up, my dear
 While, I kiss away each tear
 Or else, I shall be melancholy too
 
 Every cloud must have a silver lining
 Wait until the sun shines through
 
 Please, cuddle up, my dear
 While, I kiss away each tear
 Or else, I shall be melancholy too
 
 My old flame, I can't even think of his name, but it's funny now and then
 How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame
 My old flame, my new lovers all seem so tame, for I haven't met a gent
 So magnificent or elegant as my old flame
 
 I've met so many who had fascinating ways
 A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
 But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
 I can't even think of his name, but I'll never be the same
 Until I discover what became of my old flame

 My one and only,
 What am I gonna do if you turn me down
 When I`m so crazy over you?
 
 I`d be so lonely
 Where am I gonna go if you turn me down
 Why blacken all my skies of blue?
 
 I tell you, I`m not asking any miracle
 It can be done, it can be done
 I know a clergyman who will grow lyrical
 And make us one, and make us one
 
 So, my one and only
 There isn`t a reason why you should turn me down
 When I`m so crazy over you
 
 I tell you, I`m not asking any miracle
 It can be done, it can be done
 I know a clergyman who will grow lyrical
 And make us one, and make us one
 
 So, my one and only
 There isn`t a reason why you should turn me down
 When I`m so crazy over you
 
 Oh, I`m so crazy over you
 
 The very thought of you makes my heart sing
 Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
 And you appear in all your splendor,
 My one and only love.
 
 The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
 In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
 I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
 My one and only love.
 
 The touch of your hand is like heaven,
 A heaven that I've never known.
 The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
 Tells me that you are my own.
 
 You fill my eager heart with such desire.
 Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
 I give myself in sweet surrender,
 My one and only love.
 
 When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing
 When the twilight is gone you come into my heart
 And here in my heart you will stay while I pray
 
 My prayer is to linger with you
 At the end of the day in a dream that's divine
 My prayer is a rapture in blue
 With the world far away and your lips close to mine
 
 Tonight while our hearts are aglow
 Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know
 
 My prayer and the answer you give
 May they still be the same for as long as we live
 That you'll always be there at the end of my prayer
 
 Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
 I can see that this love was meant for me
 Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
 Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
 My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
 Without you life will never begin to be
 So love me as I love you in my reverie
 Make my dream a reality 
 Let's dispense with formality
 Come to me in my reverie
 
 Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
 I can see that this love was meant for me
 Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
 Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
 My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
 Without you life will never begin to be
 So love me as I love you in my reverie
 Make my dream a reality 
 Let's dispense with formality
 Come to me in my reverie
 
 My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
 My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
 No month of may, no twinkling stars
 No hide away, no softly guitars
 
 My romance doesn't need a castle rising in spain
 Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
 Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
 
 My romance doesn't need a thing but you
 My romance doesn't need a thing but you
 
 This moment, this minute
 And each second in it
 Will leave a glow upon the sky
 And as time goes by, it will never die
 
 This will be my shining hour
 Calm and happy and bright
 And in my dreams, your face will flower
 Through the darkness of the night
 
 Like the lights of home before me
 Or an angel, who's watching over me
 This will be my shining hour
 'Til I'm with you again
 
 Like the lights of home before me
 Or an angel watching over me
 This will be my shining hour
 'Til I'm with you again
 
 My ship has sails that are made of silk
 The decks are trimmed with gold
 And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold
 
 My ship's aglow with a million pearls
 And rubies fill each bin
 The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in
 
 I can wait the years
 Till it appears
 One fine day one spring
 But the pearls and such
 They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing
 
 I do not care if that day arrives
 That dream need never be
 If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
 My own true love to me
 If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me
 
 My mommy told me
 If I was goody
 That she would buy me
 A wubba dolly
 
 So don't you tella
 I kissed a fella
 Or she won't buy me
 That wubba dolly
 
 I know
 I've been up to tricks
 Oh-oh
 I'm in a fix
 
 I want that dolly
 Indeed I do
 But what a fella
 I want him too
 
 Is it the fella or the dolly or the dolly or the fella or the fella or the dolly for you?
 Is it the fella or the dolly or the dolly or the fella, what are you gonna do
 
 I'll be a goodie
 Just watch and you'll see
 And she will buy me
 A wubba dolly
 
 Oh yes I'm sorry
 About the dolly
 Because we told her, woo hoo
 About this feller
 
 Boo hoo
 Oh why did you
 Oh boys
 I wouldn't do it to you
 
 Why did you tella
 I kissed a fella
 Now she won't buy me
 A wubba dolly
 
 We didn't tella
 You kissed a fella
 Oh goody-goody, and now she'll buy me
 That wubba dolly
 
 Oh look here comes my mommy
 And just look what she's got me
 My mammy bought me
 A little bitty wubba dolly
 
 She sho' did, she sho' did!
 
 There was a boy
 A very strange, enchanted boy
 They say he wandered very far, very far
 Over land and sea
 A little shy and sad of eye
 But very wise was he
 
 And then one day
 A magic day he passed my way
 And while we spoke of many things
 Fools and kings
 This he said to me
 "The greatest thing you'll ever learn
 Is just to love and be loved in return"
 
 "The greatest thing you'll ever learn
 Is just to love and be loved in return"
 
 The man who only lives for making money
 Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
 Likewise the man who works for fame
 There's no guarantee
 That time won't erase his name
 
 The fact is, the only work
 That really brings enjoyment
 Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
 Fall in love, you won't regret it
 That's the best work of all, if you can get it
 
 Holding hands at midnight
 'Neath a starry sky
 Nice work if you can get it
 And you can get it if you try
 
 Strolling with the one girl
 Sighing sigh after sigh
 Nice work if you can get it
 And you can get it if you try
 
 Just imagine someone
 Waiting at the cottage door
 Where two hearts become one
 Who could ask for anything more
 
 Loving one who loves you
 And then taking that vow
 Nice work if you can get it
 And if you get it, won't you tell me how
 
 Just imagine someone
 Waiting at the cottage door
 Where two hearts become one
 Who could ask for anything more
 
 Loving one who loves you
 And then taking that vow
 Nice work if you can get it
 And if you get it, won't you tell me how
 
 Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
 When the jungle shadows fall
 Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
 As it stands against the wall
 
 Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
 When the summer shower is through
 So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
 
 Night and day, you are the one
 Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
 Whether near to me or far
 It's no matter, darling, where you are
 I think of you
 
 Night and day, day and night, why is it so
 That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
 In the roaring traffic's boom
 In the silence of my lonely room
 
 I think of you
 Night and day, night and day
 Under the hide of me
 There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
 
 And its torment won't be through
 'Till you let me spend my life making love to you
 Day and night, night and day
 
 Night and day
 Under the hide of me
 There's an, oh, such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
 And its torment won't be through
 'Till you let me spend my life making love to you
 Day and night, night and day
 
 No other love have I
 Only my love for you
 Only the dream we knew
 No other love
 
 Watching the night go by
 Wishing that you could be
 Watching the night with me
 Into the night I cry
 
 Hurry home
 Come home to me
 Set me free
 Free from doubt
 And free from longing
 
 Into your arms I'll fly
 Locked in your arms I'll stay
 Waiting to hear you say
 No other love have I
 No other love
 
  
 
 Hurry home
 Come home to me
 Set me free
 Free from doubt
 And free from longing
 
 Into your arms I'll fly
 Locked in your arms I'll stay
 Waiting to hear you say
 No other love have I
 No other love 
 No other love
 
 I wake up every morning with a smile on my face
 Everything in it's place as it should be
 I start out every morning just as free as the breeze
 My cares upon the shelf
 Because I find myself with
 
 No strings and no connections
 No ties to my affections
 I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy
 
 No dates that can't be broken
 No words that can't be spoken
 Especially when I am feeling romancy
 
 Like a robin upon a tree
 Like a sailor that goes to sea
 Like an unwritten melody
 I'm free, that's me
 
 So
 
 Bring on the big attraction
 My decks are cleared for action
 I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy
 
 All the world's great lovers have been glorified
 History placed them in a romantic set
 In between book covers they are side by side
 But the real thing hasn't been written yet
 
 Now it can be told
 Told in all its glory
 Now that we have met
 The world may know the sentimental story
 
 The greatest romance they ever knew
 Is waiting to
 Unfold
 
 Now it can be told
 As an inspiration
 Every other tale
 Of boy meets girl is just an imitation
 
 The great love story
 Has never been told before
 But now
 Now it can be told
 
 O come all ye faithful
 Joyful and triumphant
 O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
 Come and behold Him
 Born the King of Angels
 
 O come, let us adore Him
 O come, let us adore Him
 O come, let us adore Him
 Christ the Lord
 
 Sing, choirs of Angels
 Sing in exultation
 O sing, all ye citizens of Heaven above
 Glory to God
 Glory in the highest
 
 O come, let us adore Him
 O come, let us adore Him
 O come, let us adore Him
 Christ the Lord
 
 Yea, Lord, we greet Thee
 Born this happy morning
 Jesus to Thee be all glory giv'n
 Word of the Father
 Now in flesh appearing
 
 O come, let us adore Him
 O come, let us adore Him
 O come, let us adore Him
 Christ the Lord
 
 O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
 It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
 Long lay the world in sin and error pining
 Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
 
 A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
 For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
 Fall on your knees; oh, hear the angel voices
 O night divine, O night when Christ was born
 
 O night divine
 O night
 O night divine
 Night divine
 
 Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
 The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
 
 For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
 While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
 Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
 And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.
 
 Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
 Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
 Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
 The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.
 
 From the island of Manhattan to the coast of gold
 From north to south, from east to west
 You are the love, I love the best
 You're the dreamboat in the sweetest story ever told
 
 A dream I sought, both night and day
 For years through all, the U.S.A.
 The star I hitched my wagon to
 Is very obviously you
 
 Of thee I sing, baby
 Summer, autumn, winter, spring, baby.
 You're my silver lining,
 You're my sky of blue
 There's a lovelight shining
 Just because of you.
 
 Of thee I sing, baby,
 You have got that certain thing, baby
 Shining star and inspiration
 Worthy of a mighty nation,
 Of thee I sing.
 
 Of thee I sing, baby,
 You have got that certain thing, baby
 Shining star and inspiration
 Worthy of a mighty nation,
 Of thee I sing.
 
 Oh, Johnny, oh, Johnny
 How you can love!
 Oh, Johnny, oh, Johnny
 Heavens above!
 You make my sad heart jump with joy
 And when you're near I just
 Can't sit still a minute
 I'm so, oh, Johnny, oh, Johnny
 Please, tell me, dear
 What makes me love you so?
 You're not handsome, it's true
 But when I look at you
 I just, oh, Johnny
 Oh, Johnny, oh
 
 Listen to my tale of woe
 It's terribly sad but true
 All dressed up, no place to go
 Each evening I'm awfully blue
 I must win some handsome guy
 Can't go on like this
 I could blossom out I know
 With somebody just like you, so
 
 Oh, sweet and lovely
 Lady be good
 Oh lady be good to me
 I am so awfully misunderstood
 So lady be good, to me
 Oh, please have some pity
 I'm all alone in this big city
 I tell you I'm just
 A lonesome babe in the wood
 So lady be good to me
 
 Oh, please have some pity
 I'm all alone in this big city
 I tell you I'm just
 A lonesome babe in the wood
 So lady be good to me
 
 Oh, lady be good to me
 
 Porgy and all
 I'm on my way to a heav'nly land
 I'll ride that long, long road
 If You are there to guide my hand
 Oh Lawd, I'm on my way
 I'm on my way to a heav'nly land
 Oh Lawd, it's a long, long way, but
 You'll be there to take my hand
 
 Serena:

 (It is now full morning and Catfish Row is full
 of activity with street vendors calling.)
 
 Never thought I`d ever meet a man like you
 Who could make my life complete, by dreams come true
 
 The many men I`d known for years all seemed the same
 They kept on boring me to tears, and then you came
 
 I was taken off my feet, what could I do
 I was above love before,
 But now I love love, because you`re
 
 Oh, oh so nice
 Awake or sleeping, it seems
 That you keep creeping in my dreams
 And it`s so nice
 
 When you are near me
 Oh my, oh dear oh dear me, I just fly
 To paradise
 
 I was above love before
 But now I love love, `cause you`re oh, oh, oh so nice
 
 When you are near me
 Oh my, oh dear oh dear me, I just fly
 To paradise
 
 I was above love before
 But now I love love, `cause you`re oh, oh, oh so nice
 `Cause you`re oh, oh, oh so nice
 `Cause you`re oh, oh, oh so nice
 
 Oh, what a night
 Late December back in '63
 What a very special time for me
 'Cause I remember what a night
 
 Oh, what a night
 You know, I didn't even know her name
 But I was never gonna be the same
 What a lady, what a night
 
 Oh, I, I got a funny feeling when she walked
 In the room and I
 As I recall it ended much too soon
 
 Oh, what a night
 Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
 She was everything I dreamed she'd be
 Sweet surrender, what a night
 
 I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
 Spinnin' my head around and taking my body under
 Oh, what a night
 
 Oh, I, I got a funny feeling when she walked
 In the room and I
 As I recall it ended much too soon
 
 Oh, what a night
 Why'd it take so long to see the light?
 Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
 What a lady, what a night
 
 I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
 Spinnin' my head around and taking my body under
 Oh, what a night
 (Do, do, do, do, do
 Do, do, do, do, do, do)
 Oh, what a night
 (Do, do, do, do, do
 Do, do, do, do, do, do)
 Oh, what a night
 (Do, do, do, do, do
 Do, do, do, do, do, do)
 Oh, what a night
 (Do, do, do, do, do
 Do, do, do, do, do, do)
 Oh, what a night
 (Do, do, do, do, do
 Do, do, do, do, do, do)
 Oh, what a night
 (Do, do, do, do, do
 Do, do, do, do, do, do)
 
 Now one time there lived an old man
 With a very crooked nose
 He lived inside a log hut
 And they called him Ol' Man Mose
 One dark and dreary morning I knocked upon his door
 I didn't hear a single sound
 So I ain't gonna do it no more
 
 'Cause I believe Ol' Man, I believe Ol' Man
 I believe Ol' Man, that Ol' Man Mose is dead
 I believe Ol' Man, I believe Ol' Man
 I believe Ol' Man, that Ol' Man Mose is dead
 
  Mose kicked the bucket
  Mose kicked the bucket
  Mose kicked the bucket
 
  Mose kicked the bucket
  Mose kicked the bucket
  Mose kicked the bucket
 
 Now listen here
 I went 'round to the window
 And I peeped in through the crack
 Inside there was an old man
 Laying flat upon his back
 I thought that he was sleeping
 Head hung to the floor
 He didn't make a single move
 So I ain't gonna do it no more
 
 'Cause I found out Ol' Man, I found out Ol' Man
 Yeah, I found out Ol' Man, Ol' Man Mose is dead
 
  Ol' Man
  Ol' Man
  Ol' Man
 
  Mose kicked the bucket
  Mose kicked the bucket
  Mose kicked the bucket
 
  Mose kicked the bucket
  Mose kicked the bucket
  Mose kickin' up daisies
 
 Ol' Man Mose is dead
 
 I look at you and suddenly something in your eyes I see
 Soon begins bewitching me
 It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies
 It's that old devil moon in your eyes
 
 You and your glance make this romance too hot to handle
 Stars in the night blazing their light can't hold a candle
 To your razzle-dazzle
 You've got me flyin' high and wide on a magic carpet ride
 
 Full of butterflies inside
 Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon
 It's that old devil moon in your eyes
 Just when I think I'm free as a dove
 Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love
 
 Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
 And on this farm there was a chick
 The prettiest chick I know
 With a little curve here and a little curve there
 This chick she had curves everywhere
 Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
 
 And, oh, this chick she had to walk, E-I-E-I-O
 And how this walk would drive 'em wild swinging to and 'fro
 With a little wiggle here and a little wiggle there
 Man, this chick had wiggles to spare
 Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
 
 When she went walking into town, E-I-E-I-O
 The local gentry popped their eyes
 Tarnation, what a show
 With a goldang here and a goshdarn there
 Heavens to Betsy I do declare
 OlD MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
 
 There was a barn dance Saturday night, E-I-E-I-O
 And the fellows came from miles around
 Just to see her dosey-do
 With a promenade here and a promenade there
 At a square dance, boy, this chick was no square
 Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
 
 I used to be a traveling man, E-I-E-I-O
 Until I hit MacDonald's place
 Things were mighty slow
 With a little chick here and a little chick there
 I didn't have a real chick anywhere
 Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
 
 This farmer's daughter knocked me out, E-I-E-I-O
 I asked MacDonald for her hand
 And, pop, he hollered "go!"
 With a little curve here and a little wiggle there
 A goldang here and a goshdarn there
 A dosey-do here and a promenade there
 Got my own private county fair
 'Cause old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
 
 
 
 It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
 A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
 Romance was the theme
 And we were the players
 I never think of this without a sigh
 
 Lover, one lovely day
 Love came, planning to stay
 Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
 The setting for nights beyond forgetting
 And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
 When I recall the love I found on
 I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
 Lover, one lovely day
 Love came, planning to stay
 Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
 The setting for nights beyond forgetting
 And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
 When I recall the love I found on
 On Green Dolphin Street
 
 It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened

 Romance was the theme
 And we were the players

 Lover, one lovely day
 Love came, planning to stay
 Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
 The setting for nights beyond forgetting
 And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
 When I recall the love I found on
 On Green Dolphin Street
 
 Walked with no one and talked with no one
 And I had nothing but shadows
 Then one morning you passed
 And I brightened at last
 Now I greet the day and complete the day
 With the sun in my heart
 All my worry blew away
 When you taught me how to say
 
 Grab your coat and get your hat
 Leave your worry on the doorstep
 Just direct your feet
 To the sunny side of the street
 Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
 And that happy tune is your step
 Life can be so sweet
 On the sunny side of the street
 
 I used to walk in the shade
 With those blues on parade
 But I'm not afraid
 This Rover crossed over
 
 If I never have a cent
 I'd be rich as Rockefeller
 Gold dust at my feet
 On the sunny side of the street
 Grab your street
 
 One I loved
 And I gave so much love to this love
 It was the world to me
 
 Once I cried
 At the thought I was foolish and proud
 And let you say goodbye
 
 And one day
 From my infinite sadness you came
 And brought me love again
 
 Now I know
 That no matter whatever befalls
 I'll never let you go
 
 I will hold you close
 Make you stay
 Because love is the saddest thing
 When it goes away
 
 Love is the sad, saddest thing
 When it goes away
 
 And one day
 From my infinite sadness you came
 And brought me love again
 
 Now I know
 That no matter whatever befalls
 I'll never let you go
 
 I will hold you close
 Make you stay
 Because love is the sad, saddest thing
 When it goes away
 
 When a maiden is wooed by a man
 His advances she frequently spurns
 In her anger one day
 She may send him away
 Then she's anxious until he returns
 Until he returns
 She provokes him as much as she can
 But she likes him to still persevere
 Oh, it's very remiss
 And the danger is this
 She may do it too often, I fear
 She may do it too often, I fear
 Once too often
 Time after time
 Doubtless his heart will soften
 But the day may arrive
 When she finds out, alack
 That her lover will leave her
 And never come back
 She's refused him just once too often
 
 Then that maiden will sit there and sigh
 For the lesson is bitter indeed
 Now she's quite wide awake
 She can see her mistake
 And for pardon she's longing to plead
 She's longing to plead
 She has let all her chances pass by
 And the moral may clearly be seen
 For whoever you are
 It is better by far
 If you always will say what you mean
 If you always will say what you mean
 Once too often
 Time after time
 Doubtless his heart will soften
 But the day may arrive
 When she finds out, alack
 That her lover will leave her
 And never come back
 She's refused him just once too often
 Once too often
 
 It's quarter to three
 There's no one in the place except you and me
 So set 'em' up, Joe
 I got a little story you ought to know
 
 We're drinking, my friend
 To the end of a brief episode
 Make it one for my baby
 And one more for the road
 
 I got the routine
 So drop another nickel in the machine
 I'm feelin' so bad
 I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad
 
 I could tell you a lot
 But you've gotta be true to your code
 Make it one for my baby
 And one more for the road
 
 You'd never know it
 But, buddy, I'm a kind of poet
 And I've got a lot of things to say
 And if I'm gloomy
 You simply gotta listen to me
 Until it's all talked away
 
 Well, that's how it goes
 And, Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close
 So thanks for the cheer
 I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
 
 This torch that I've found
 Must be drowned or it soon might explode
 Make it one for my baby
 And one more for the road
 
 Well, that's how it goes
 And, Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close
 So thanks for the cheer
 I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear
 
 This torch that I've found
 Must be drowned or it soon might explode
 Make it one for my baby
 And one more for the road
 The long, long road
 
 
 Do I want to be with you
 As the years come and go?
 Only forever
 If you care to know
 
 Would I grant all your wishes
 And be proud of the task
 Only forever
 If someone should ask
 
 How long would it take me
 To be near if you beckon?
 Off hand I would figure
 Less than a second
 
 Do you think I'll remember
 How you looked when you smile?
 Only forever
 That's puttin' it mild
 
 How long would it take me
 To be near if you beckon?
 Off hand I would figure
 Less than a second
 
 Do you think I'll remember
 How you looked when you smile?
 Only forever
 That's puttin' it mild
 
 Ooh la, la, la, la.
 I did you wrong, my heart went out to play 
 And in the game I lost you, what a price to pay!
 I'm cryin', ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
 Mistakes I know I've made a few, 
 But I'm only human;  you've made mistakes too!
 I'm cryin', ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
 Ooh baby baby
 Ooh baby baby I'm just about at the end of my rope.
 But I can't stop tryin', I can't give up hope 
 'cause I feel someday I'll hold you near, 
 Whisper I still love you 
 Until that day is here ooh I'm cryin'.
 
 Ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
 Oops, my heart went oops,
 The moment that we met, my heart went oops,
 I never will forget, my heart turned hoops,
 The moment that I met you
 
 Oops, my feet went oops,
 I nearly took a spill, my knees went oops,
 They shook up it until, my head went oops,
 You mustn't let it get you
 
 I was going for a very
 Choo'd call a solitary sorta stroll
 Just a twiddle of my thumb
 When I heard a lot of drums begun to pound and roar
 
 And oops, my heart went oops,
 It went into a spin of loop-di-loops
 You must've thought me kin to nincompoops
 The silly way I acted
 
 Of course you wouldn't know,
 That you were so a-glow, and I was so attracted
 But baby take a bow
 My heart is going oops right now
 
 Pops you are the tops
 The moment that my eyes behold your chops
 You lift me to the skies my heart flip-flops
 You shouldn't make it make like that
 
 Bell, my bucksom bell
 I'm still in love with you cause truth tell,
 You always kinda knew that we would gel
 Cause jam could never shake like that
 
 I was going for a frantic
 But completely unromantic sorta drive
 But I knew you wouldn't quit
 When I dug you and you hit me with that old time jive
 
 Then oops, my heart went oops
 Sitting on the stoops, the local droops
 They nearly flipped their toops, I mean in groups
 The silly way we acted
 
 Of course they couldn't know
 That you were so a-glow
 And I was so attracted
 Yes baby take a bow,
 My heart is going oops, oops, oops, oops, oops right now
 Oops, oops then
 
 Open your window and take a deep sigh
 Think about letting the rest of the world go fly a kite
 Takin' it easy is easy as pie
 And holdin' your hand is such a natural high
 
 You sent flowers, we spent hours
 We can be happy alone in a tent
 Think of the money we'd save on rent
 
 You sent flowers, we spent hours
 We can be happy alone in a tent
 Just think of the money we'd save on rent
 
 If you just open your window and take a deep sigh
 And holdin' your hand is such a natural high
 
 Who's that coming down the street?
 Good old organ grinder Pete
 He's the latest rhythm king
 With his organ grinder's swing
 Dadya, Pa swings it, so does Ma
 Dadya, Ma swings it, so does Pa
 Dadya, you swing it, so do I
 Dadya, I swing it so do you
 
 When he turns that handle down
 Music goes around and 'round
 Ev'rybody starts to sing 
 To that organ grinder's swing
 Trala,  Pa swings it, so does Ma
 Trala, Ma swings it, so does Pa
 Trala, you swing it, so do I
 Trala, I swing it so do you
 
 All the children tag along
 Just to listen to his song
 Monkey dancing on a string
 To the organ grinder's swing
 O-hum, Pa swings it, so does Ma
 O-hum, Ma swings it, so does Pa
 O-hum, you swing it, so do I
 O-hum, I swing it so do you
 
 The more I read the papers, the less I comprehend.
 The world and all it's capers and how it all will end.
 Nothing seems to be lasting, but that isn't our affair.
 We've got something permanent,
 I mean in the way we care.
 
 It's very clear our love is here to stay.
 Not for a year, but ever and a day.
 The radio and the telephone.
 And the movies that we know.
 May just be passing fancies and in time may go.
 But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay.
 Together were going a long, long way.
 In time the Rockies may crumble,
 Gibraltar may tumble, they're only made of clay.
 But our love is here to stay.
 
 You came to me from out of nowhere
 You took my heart and found it free
 Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
 Made every hour sweet as a flower for me
 
 If you should go back to your nowhere
 Leaving me with a memory
 I`ll always wait for your return out of nowhere
 Hoping you`ll bring your love to me
 
 You're clear out of this world
 When I'm looking at you
 I hear out of this world
 The music that no mortal ever knew
 
 You're right out of a book
 The fairy tale I read when I was five
 No armored knight out of a book
 Was more enchanted by a loralei
 Then I
 
 After waiting so long
 For the right time
 After reaching so long for a star
 All at once from long and lonely night time
 And despite time, here you are
 
 I cry, "out of this world"
 If you said we were through
 So let me fly out of this world
 And spend the next eternity or two
 With you
 
 Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
 There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
 Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
 And the dreams that you dare to dream,
 Really do come true.
 
 Someday I'll wish upon a star
 And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
 Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
 High above the chimney tops,
 That's where you'll find me.
 
 Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
 Birds fly over the rainbow
 Why then, oh why can't I?
 If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
 Why, oh why can't I?
 
 Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
 There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
 Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
 And the dreams that you dare to dream,
 Really do come true.
 
 Someday I'll wish upon a star
 And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
 Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
 High above the chimney tops,
 That's where you'll find me.
 
 Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
 Birds fly over the rainbow
 Why then, oh why can't I?
 If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
 Why, oh why can't I?
 
 
 Papa loves mambo
 Mama loves mambo
 Look at 'em sway with it
 Gettin' so gay with it
 Shoutin' "ole" with it
 Wow 
 
 Papa loves mambo 
  
 Mama loves mambo
 
 Papa does great with it
 Swings like a gate with it
 Evens his weight with it, now
 
 He goes to, she goes fro
 He goes fast, she goes slow
 He goes left and she goes right
 
 Papa loves mambo
 Mama loves mambo
 Havin' their fling again
 Younger than spring again
 Feelin' that zing again
 Wow 
 
 Papa loves mambo 
  
 Mama loves mambo
 
 Don't let her rumba and don't let her samba
 'Cause papa loves mama tonight 
 
 He goes to, she goes fro
 He goes fast, she goes slow
 He goes left and she goes right
 
 Papa loves mambo 
  
 Mama loves mambo
 
 Havin' their fling again
 Younger than spring again
 Feelin' that zing again
 Wow, oh
 
  
 Mambo papa
 
 Mambo mama
 
 'Cause papa
 Loves a mambo tonight
 
 
 Passion flower
 Sent from the blue above
 You're a flower of love
 Passion flower
 Free as a star in flight
 Laughing through the night
 
 Your lips keep taunting me
 Not wanting me
 Yet haunting me
 Each day
 
 Stay with me
 My passion flower
 You are all I'm dreaming of
 Passion flower of love
 Passion flower of love
 
 People, people who need people
 Are the luckiest people in the world
 
 We're children needing other children
 And yet letting our grown-up pride
 Hide all the need inside
 Acting more like children than children
 
 Lovers are very special people
 They're the luckiest people in the world
 
 With one person, one very special person
 A feeling deep in your soul
 Says you were half, now you're whole
 No more hunger and thirst
 But first be a person who needs people
 
 People, people who need people
 Are the luckiest people in the world
 
 No more hunger and thirst
 But first be a person who needs people
 
 People, people who need people
 Are the luckiest people in the world
 
 People, people who need people
 
 Don't throw bouquets at me, don't please my folks too much,
 Don't laugh at my jokes too much, people will say we're in love.
 Don't sigh and gaze at me, your sighs are so like mine,
 Your eyes mustn't glow like mine, people will say we're in love.
 
 Don't start collecting things, give me my rose and my glove,
 Sweetheart, they're suspecting things, people will say we're in love.
 Don't praise my charm to much, don't look so vain with me,
 Don't stand in the rain with me, people will say we're in love.
 
 Don't take my arm too much, don't keep your hand in mine,
 Your hand feels so grand in mine, people will say we're in love.
 Don't dance all night with me, till the stars fade out of sight,
 They'll see it's alright with me, people will say we're in love.
 
 Perdido
 I look for my heart
 It`s perdido
 I lost it way down in Torito
 The day the fiesta started
 
 Bolero
 I sway that they play the Bolero
 I kissed me the listing sombrero
 And that`s when my heart departed
 
 High, was the sun when I held him close
 Low, was the moon when we said, adios
 
 Perdido
 My heart ever since is Perdido
 I know I must go to Torito
 To find what I lost Perdido
 
 High, was the sun when I held him close
 Low, was the moon when we said, adios
 
 Perdido
 Goodnight perdido
 I lost perdido
 
 There are sad things
 There are bad things, the blues
 When they threaten 
 Start betting you'll lose
 
 You hide yourself behind a prayer
 The blues'll come and they'll find you there
 I mean the blues they call Pete Kelly's Blues
 
 There's no exit
 You can try the blues
 If you're born with
 You will die with the blues
 Think what you choose
 That happy dream is yours they say
 If you can pay the dues
 That's why I'm stuck with
 Fresh outta luck with the blues
 
 There's no exit
 None you can try with the blues
 See if you're born with
 You gotta die with the blues
 Think what you choose
 That happy dream is yours they say
 If you can pay the dues
 That's why I'm stuck with
 So outta luck wit the blues
 
 Some call em Pete Kelly's Blues
 You can call 'em anything you choose
 I call them blues
 
 Petootie Pie
 Petootie Pie
 You're my Petootie sugar-fruity dreamy pie
 I crave and cram
 Your special jam
 you're underrated, solidated Superman
 And every gal who passes
 Just looks and hollas "Oh!"
 Like flies caught in molasses
 Petootie Pie
 Petootie Pie
 You're such a tasty hunk of pastry, me oh my
 Gotta light the oven
 Gonna cook a dish of lovin'
 So kiss me oh my patootie pie
 
 You're my patootie pie
 We'll count to seven 
 Then steal away to heaven 
 So kiss me  and kiss me 
 So kiss me oh my petootie pie
 
 Please teacher, teach me something,
 Nice teacher, teach me something.
 I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
 My two feet haven't met yet,
 But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
 'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.
 
 Nothing's impossible I have found,
 For when my chin is on the ground,
 I pick myself up,
 Dust myself off,
 Start all over again.
 
 Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
 Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
 And pick yourself up,
 Dust yourself off,
 Start all over again.
 
 Work like a soul inspired,
 Till the battle of the day is won.
 You may be sick and tired,
 But you'll be a man, my son!
 
 Will you remember the famous men,
 Who had to fall to rise again?
 So take a deep breath,
 Pick yourself up,
 Dust yourself off,
 Start all over again.
 
 I'll get some self assurance
 If your endurance is great.
 I'll learn by easy stages
 If you're courageous and wait.
 
 To feel the strength I want to,
 I must hang on to your hand,
 Maybe by the time I'm fifty
 I'll get up and do a nifty.
 
 Nothing's impossible I have found,
 For when my chin is on the ground,

 Well, this is my first affair
 Please, be kind
 Handle my heart with care
 Please, be kind
 
 This is all so grand
 My dreams are on parade
 If you'll just understand
 They'll never, never fade
 
 So tell me your love's sincere
 Please, be kind
 Tell me I needn't fear
 Please, be kind
 
 'Cause if you leave me, dear
 I know my heart will lose its mind
 If you love me
 Please, be kind
 
 This is my first affair
 So, please, be kind
 Handle my heart with care
 Oh, please, be kind
 
 So tell me your love's sincere
 Yes, please, be kind
 Tell me I needn't fear
 Please, be kind
 
 'Cause if you leave me, dear
 I know my heart will lose its mind
 If you love me, baby
 Please, be kind
 
 Please, don't talk about me when I'm gone
 Oh, honey, though our friendship ceases from now on
 And, listen, if you can't say anything real nice
 It's better not to talk at all is my advice
 
 We're parting--you go your way, I'll go mine
 It's best that we do
 Here's a kiss; I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
 Oh, makes no difference how I carry on
 Remember, please, don't talk about me when I'm gone
 
 We're parting--you go your way, I'll go mine
 It's best that we do
 Here's a kiss; I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
 Makes no difference how I carry on
 Remember, please, don't talk about me
 Please, don't talk about me
 Please, don't talk about me when I'm gone
 
 A country dance was being held in a garden
 I felt a bump and heard an "oh, beg your pardon"
 Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
 All around a pug-nosed dream
 
 The music started and was I the perplexed one
 I held my breath and said, "May I have the next one?"
 In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
 Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream
 
 There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
 As we floated over the floor
 There were questions, but my heart knew all the answers
 And perhaps a few things more
 
 Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
 I know the meaning of the words "ever after"
 And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
 When I kiss the pug-nosed dream
 
 If you hear
 A song in blue
 Like a flower crying
 For the dew
 That was my heart serenading you
 My prelude to a kiss
 
 If you hear a song that grows
 From my tender sentimental woes
 That was my heart trying to compose
 A prelude to a kiss
 
 Though it's just a simple melody
 With nothing fancy
 Nothing much
 You could turn it to a symphony
 A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch
 
 Oh how my love song gently cries
 For the tenderness within your eyes
 My love is a prelude that never dies
 A prelude to a kiss
 
 Though it's just a simple melody
 With nothing fancy
 Nothing much
 You could turn it to a symphony
 A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch
 
 Oh how my love song so gently cries
 For the tenderness within your eyes
 My love is a prelude that never dies
 A prelude to a kiss
 
 Think of your fellow man, lend him a helping hand
 Put a little love in your heart
 You see, it's getting late, oh, please don't hesitate
 Put a little love in your heart
 
 And the world will be a better place
 And the world will be a better place for you and me
 You just wait and see
 
 Another day goes by, and still the children cry
 Put a little love in your heart
 If you want the world to know, we won't let hatred grow
 Put a little love in your heart
 
 And the world will be a better place
 And the world will be a better place for you and me
 You just wait and see. Wait and see
 
 Take a good look around and if you're lookin' down
 Put a little love in your heart
 I hope when you decide kindness will be your guide
 Put a little love in your heart
 And the world will be a better place
 And the world will be a better place for you and me
 You just wait and see
 Put a little love in your heart
 Put a little love in your heart
 
 
 Quiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
 Floating on the silence that surrounds us.
 
 Quiet thoughts and dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams,
 And a window on the mountains and the sea - how lovely!
 
 This is where I want to be, here, with you so close to me
 Until the final flicker of life's ember.
 
 I, who was lost and lonely, believing life was only
 A bitter, tragic joke have found with you
 The meaning of existence, oh, my love.
 
 April showers, overhead offer me a chance
 To protect her from the rain and cultivate romance
 It's an opportunity, something to enjoy
 Helter, skelter fly for shelter I'm a lucky boy
 
 Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
 On the pane and we're alone
 A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
 A lovely peaceful afternoon 
 No one can see us
 Rain It's so cozy in the rain
 There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
 To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
 You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain
 
 Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
 On the pane and we're alone
 A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
 A lovely peaceful afternoon 
 No one can see us
 Rain It's so cozy in the rain
 There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
 To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
 You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain
 
 Raindrops are falling on my head
 And just like the guy who's feet are too big for his bed
 Nothing seems to fit
 
 Those raindrops are falling on my head
 They keep falling
 
 So I just did me some talking to the sun
 And said I didn't like the way he got things done
 Sleeping on the job
 
 Those raindrops are falling on my head
 They keep falling
 
 But there's one thing I know
 The blues they sent to greet me won't defeat me
 It won't be long for happiness steps up to meet me
 
 Raindrops are falling on my head
 And even though my eyes seem to be turning red
 Crying's not for me
 
 'Cause I'm not complaining about the rain that keeps falling
 Because I'm free and nothing's worryin' me
 Nothing's worryin' me, nothing's worryin' me
 
 But there's one thing I know
 The blues they sent to meet me won't defeat me
 It won't be long for happiness steps up to greet me
 
 Raindrops are falling on my head
 And though it seems as though my eyes are turning red
 Crying's not for me
 
 I'm not complaining about the rain that keeps falling
 Because I'm free and nothing's worryin' me
 No, no, nothing's worryin' me
 
 Happy days, nothing's worryin' me
 Happy days, nothing's worryin' me
 Watch the rain, yeah, falling on my head
 I said nothing, nothing's worryin' me
 
 Happy days
 Happy days
 Nothing's worryin' me
 
 And if rain drops falling on me
 And nothing's worryin' me
 Nothing's worryin' me
 
 Reach for tomorrow
 Today belongs to the past
 The golden hopes of your yesterdays
 Can all be yours at last
 
 Reach for tomorrow
 And keep your head in the sky
 You may get hurt
 In a thousand ways
 But give it one more try
 
 Have no regret about
 Forget about
 The chances you missed
 In days to come
 I know there's something
 Better than this
 
 Reach for tomorrow
 And keep your dreams ever new
 No matter how many times it seems
 That dreams are not for you
 
 Reach for tomorrow
 And make them all come true
 
 The moon and you appear to be
 So near and yet so far from me
 And here am I on a night in June
 Reaching for the moon and you,
 
 I wonder if we'll ever meet
 My song of love is incomplete
 I'm just the words, looking for the tune
 Reaching for the moon and you.
 
 I'm just the words, looking for the tune
 Reaching for the moon and you.
 
 One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
 One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
 One little heartache left as a token
 One little plaything carelessly broken
 
 Remember the night
 The night you said, "I love you"
 Remember?
 
 Remember you vowed
 By all the stars above you
 Remember?
 
 Remember we found a lonely spot
 And after I learned to care a lot
 
 You promised that you'd forget me not
 But you forgot
 To remember
 
 Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
 You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
 May
 But soon the may time turned to December
 You had forgotten, do you remember?
 
 Turn off that charm
 I'm through with love for awhile
 I'm through and yet, you have a fabulous smile
 So if I forget
 
 Remind me
 Not to find you so attractive
 Remind me
 That the world is full of men
 
 When I start to miss you
 To touch your hand
 To kiss you
 Remind me
 To count to ten
 
 I had a feeling when I met you
 You'd drive me crazy if I let you
 But all my efforts to forget you
 Remind me I'm in love again
 
 I get my heart, well in hand, and I'm certain
 That I can take you, or leave you alone
 Then you begin that beguine again
 And boom, I give in , again
 I have a will made of steel, my friend
 But when it seems about to bend
 
 Remind me
 Not to mention that I love you
 Remind me
 To be sorry that we met
 
 Although I adore you
 Remind me to ignore you
 You're one thing I will regret
 
 So when your charm begins to blind me
 I'll simply tie my hands behind me
 Don't let me kiss you please, remind me
 Unless, my darling, you forget
 
 Rhythm and romance
 Romance and rhythm
 Taught me to sparkle anew
 Brought me dream-of-able you
 Sweetheart
 
 Rhythm and romance
 Romance and rhythm
 An inconceivable pair
 That gave our budding affair
 Its start
 
 The stars gleam
 The moon beams
 The skies seem to smile
 The breeze flies
 A tree sighs
 Please stay around a while
 
 Rhythm and romance
 Romance and rhythm
 A combination so real
 An invitation to steal
 Your heart
 
 Now the stars gleam
 The moon beams
 The skies seem to smile
 Oh, the breeze flies
 A tree sighs
 Please, stay around a while
 
 Rhythm and romance
 Romance and rhythm
 A combination so real
 Oh, oh, an invitation to steal
 Your heart
 
 Life's great, life's grand
 Future, all planned
 No more, clouds in the sky
 How'm I ridin'? I'm ridin' high
 
 Someone, I love
 Mad for, my love
 So long, Jonah, goodbye
 How'm I ridin'? I'm ridin' high
 
 Floating, on a starlit ceiling
 Doting, on the cards I'm dealing
 Gloating, because I'm feeling so hap-hap-happy, I'm slap-happy
 So ring bells, sing songs
 
 Blow horns, beat gongs
 Our love, never will die
 How'm I ridin'? I'm ridin' high
 
 Someone, I love
 Mad for, my love
 So long, Jonah, goodbye
 How'm I ridin'? I'm ridin' high
 
 Floating, on a starlit ceiling
 Doting, on the cards I'm dealing
 Gloating, because I'm feeling so hap-hap-happy, I'm slap-happy
 So ring bells, sing songs
 
 Blow horns, beat gongs
 Our love, never will die
 How'm I ridin'? I'm ridin' high
 
 Give me something gentle
 Make it sentimental
 Whatever you could suggest
 I'll take Robbin's Nest
 
 Make it sweet and tender
 So I must surrender
 You know I'd like nothing but the best
 So I'll take Robbin's Nest
 
 For when I get that feeling
 Goin' 'round and 'round
 Something brings me down
 Way down, way down
 
 Give me something sweet and gentle
 Make it sentimental
 Whatever you could suggest
 I'll take Robbin's Nest
 
 When I get that feeling
 Goin' 'round and 'round
 Something brings me down
 Way down, way down
 
 Give me something sweet and gentle
 Make it sentimental
 Whatever you could suggest
 I'll take Robbin's Nest
 
 I heard it came to town
 A new kind of rhythm
 Spread around
 Sort of set you sizzlin'
 Now I'm all through with symphony
 Oh, rock it for me
 
 Every night
 You'll see all the nifties
 Plenty tight
 Swingin' down the fifties
 Now they're all through with symphony
 Ho ho ho, rock it for me
 
 Now it's true that once upon a time
 The opera was the thing
 But today the rage is rhythm and rhyme
 So won't you satisfy my soul
 With the rock and roll?
 
 You can't be tame
 While the band is playin'
 It ain't no shame
 To keep your body swayin'
 Beat it out in the minor key
 Ho ho ho, rock it for me
 
 Can't you hear me singin', la-la-la-la-la
 While the band is swingin'
 Oh, Chick Webb's sockin'
 And the band is rockin'
 So send me lightly, politely
 Brightly, and slightly
 Ho ho ho, rock it for me
 
 Now I'm all through with this stuff they call symphony
 Come on, boys, and sorta rock it for me
 
 It's true that once upon a time
 The opera was the thing
 But today the rage is rhythm and rhyme
 So won't you satisfy my soul
 With the rock and roll?
 
 You can't be tame
 While the band is playin'
 It ain't no shame
 To keep your body swayin'
 Beat it out in the minor key
 Oh, rock it
 Oh, rock it
 Say, won't you rock it for me?
 
 Why even all the nifties they don't want to hear any more symphony
 I'm tellin' you, Jack, you better get hip for yourself and rock it for me
 
 I was a stranger in the city
 Out of town were the people I knew
 I had that feeling of self-pity
 What to do, what to do, what to do?
 The outlook was decidedly blue
 
 But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
 It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known
 
 A foggy day, in London town
 Had me low, had me down
 I viewed the morning with much alarm
 British museum had lost it's charm
 
 How long I wondered
 Could this thing last
 But the age of miracles hadn't past
 For, suddenly, I saw you there
 And through foggy London town
 The sun was shining everywhere
 
 For, suddenly, I saw you there
 And through foggy London town
 The sun was shining everywhere
 
 Everywhere
 Everywhere
 Everywhere
 
 Don't mind telling you, in my humble fash
 That you thrill me through, with a tender pash,
 When you said you care, 'magine my emoshe
 I swore then and there, permanent devoshe,
 You made all other men seem blah
 Just you alone filled me with 
 
 's wonderful, 's marvellous
 You should care for me!
 's awful nice, 's paradise,
 's what I love to see.
 
 You've made my life so glamorous,
 You can't blame me for feeling amorous!
 Oh 's wonderful, 's marvellous,
 That you should care for me!
 
 's magnificque, 's what I seek
 You should care for me.
 's elegant, 's what I want,
 's what I love to see.
 
 My dear, it's four leaved clover time,
 From now on my heart's working overtime,
 's exceptional, 's no bagatelle,
 That you should care for
 That you should care for
 That you should care for me
 
 Original Version 
 
 Life has just begun:
 Jack has found his jill.
 Don't know what you've done,
 But I'm all-a-thrill.
 How can words express
 Your divine appeal? 
 You could never guess
 All the love I feel.
 From now on, lady, I insist,
 For me no other grls exist.
 
 's wonderful, 's marvellous
 You should care for me!
 's awful nice, 's paradise,
 's what I love to see.
 
 You've made my life so glamorous,
 You can't blame me for feeling amorous!
 Oh 's wonderful, 's marvellous,
 That you should care for me!
 
 Don't mind telling you, in my humble fash
 That you thrill me through, with a tender pash,
 When you said you care, 'magine my emoshe
 I swore then and there, permanent devosh,
 You made all other men seem blah
 Just you alone filled me with
 
 's wonderful, 's marvellous

 My dear it's four-leaf clover time;
 From now on my heart's working overtime.
 Oh, 's wonderful! 's marvelous
 That you should care for me!
 
 No use of talkin', no use of talkin'
 You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where
 There's jazz-copation, blues modulation
 Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear
 Most everybody likes the blues
 
 Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
 If it's blues you are cravin', just come on down
 You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
 Soon you'll be sayin', "Hon, jazz me 'round"
 Because your feet they can't refuse
 
 What's that familiar strain, that true blue note refrain?
 It's drivin' me insane
 Can't keep still though; it's against my will
 I'm on my P's and Q's; I just can't refuse
 
 There goes that melody; it sounds so good to me
 And I am up a tree
 It's a shame you don't know the name
 It's a brand new blues, the Royal Garden Blues
 
 Everybody Grab somebody and start jazzing 'round
 
 Hon, don't you hear that trombone moan?
 Just listen to that saxophone
 Gee, hear that clarinet and flute
 Cornet jazzin' with a mute
 Makes me just throw myself away
 When I hear 'em play
 
 That weepin' melancholy strain
 Say, but it's soothing to the brain
 Just wanna get right up and dance
 Don't care--I'll take most any chance
 No other blues I'd care to choose
 But Royal Garden Blues
 
 Well, you know Dasher, and Dancer, and Prancer, and Vixen
 
 But do you recall
 The most famous reindeer of all?
 
 Is it Herman? 
 Is it Shermon? 
 Is it Eddy, is it Freddy? 
 It is Heart, is it Shaptler, is it Mosteres?
 
 Talkin' 'bout Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
 Oh, him
 Had a very shiny nose
 So I heard they say if you ever saw it
 You would even say it glows
 Like a hot rasie
 
 All of the other reindeer
 Used to laugh and call him names
 
 They never let poor Rudolph
 Join in any reindeer games
 
 Then one foggy Christmas Eve
 Santa came to say
 "Hey Rudolph, I say Rudolph, with your nose so bright
 Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
 
 Then how the reindeer's loved him
 And they shouted out with glee
 
 Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
 You'll go down in history!
 
 (Well, the stake glows bosset
 His snarl snoot
 His tuba that glow like a light-ta-root)
 With his pink kazoo, he guided the sleigh
  
 Why, Rudolph saved the day
 
 Rudolph has got his red nose
 In the reign deer hall of fame
 Rudolph the red nosed favorite
 Of the little reign deer days
 Rudolph the North Pole big shot
 Rides around in Santa's sleigh
 Wearin' a green Fedora
 Smoking a cigar all day
 
 (This story has a moral
 Anyone can plainly see)
 Just keep your red nose a gleemin'
 You'll go down in history
 
 If you keep your beak all pink and sleek
 And if you keep your snooze maroon because
 You'll go down in history
 
 My gal and I, we had a fight 
 And I'm all by myself
 I guess she thinks now that she's gone
 I'll lay right on the shelf
 I'm gonna show her she's all wrong
 No lonesome stuff for mine
 I won't sit home, all alone
 She'll soon find that I'm
 
 Runnin' wild,  lost control
 Runnin' wild, mighty bold
 Feelin' gay, reckless too
 Care free mind all the time, never blue
 Always goin' don't know where
 Always showin', I don't care
 Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
 All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
 When I first met that gal of mine
 It seemed just like a dream
 But when she tho't she had me right
 She started actin' mean
 Like mary led her little lamb 
 She led me all the time
 Until the worm had to turn
 That's the reason I'm
 
 Runnin' wild,  lost control
 Runnin' wild, mighty bold
 Feelin' gay, reckless too
 Care free mind all the time, never blue
 Always goin' don't know where
 Always showin', I don't care
 Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
 All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
 No gal will ever make a fool of me
 No gal! I mean just what I say
 I ain't the simpleton I used to be
 Wonder how I got that way
 
 Once I was full of sentiment, it's true
 But now I got a cruel heart
 With all that other foolishness I'm through
 Gonna play the Villain part
 
 Runnin' wild,  lost control
 Runnin' wild, mighty bold
 Feelin' gay, reckless too
 Care free mind all the time, never blue
 Always goin' don't know where
 Always showin', I don't care
 Don't love nobody, it's not worth while
 All alone, runnin' wild. Runnin' wild
 
 Where the dreamy Volga flows
 There's a lonely Russian rose
 Gazing tenderly
 Down upon her knee
 Where a baby's brown eyes glisten
 Listen
 
 Every night you'll hear her croon
 A Russian lullaby
 
 Just a little plaintive tune
 When baby starts to cry
 
 Rock-a-bye my baby
 Somewhere there may be
 
 A land that's free for you and me
 And a Russian lullaby
 
 Delilah was a floozy
 She never gave a damn
 Delilah wasn't choosy
 Till she fell for a swell buckaroo
 Whose name was Sam
 Delilah got in action
 Delilah did her "kootch"
 She gave him satisfaction
 And he fell 'neath her spell
 With the aid of love and "hootch"
 But one day, so they tell us
 His true wife, he did crave
 Delilah, she got jealous
 And she tracked him, and hacked him
 And dug for Sam a grave
 It's always that way with passion
 So cowboy, learn to behave
 Or else, you're liable to cash in
 With no tombstone on your grave
 Delilah, oh Delilah
 She's no babe in the wood
 Run cowboy, run a mile-ah
 If you love that kind of woman
 She'll do you no good
 
 Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
 Stuck in my chimney, stuck in the chimney
 Santa Claus got stuck in my chimney
 When he came last year
 
 There he was in middle of the chimney
 Roly-poly, fat, and round
 There he was in middle of the chimney
 Not quite up and not quite down
 
 Santa, please, come back to my chimney
 Back to my chimney, back
 Santa, please, come back to my chimney
 You can come back here
 'Cause baby made a brand new chimney
 Just for you this year
 Santa, come on back
 
 You better watch out you better not cry
 You better not pout I'm telling you why
 Santa Claus is coming to town
 
 He's making a list he's checking it twice
 He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
 Santa Claus is coming to town
 
 He sees you when you're sleeping
 He knows when you're awake
 He knows if you've been bad or good
 So be good for goodness sake
 
 Oh, you better watch out you better not cry
 You better not pout I'm telling you why
 Santa Claus is coming to town
 Santa Claus is coming to town
 
 Cigarette holder which wigs me
 Over her shoulder she digs me
 Out cattin' that satin doll
 Baby, shall we go out skippin'?
 
 Careful, amigo, you're flippin'
 Speaks Latin that satin doll
 She's nobody's fool so I'm playing it cool as can be
 I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no girl catching me
 
 Swich-e-rooney
 Telephone numbers well you know
 Doing my rhumbas with uno
 And that's my satin doll
 
 I've been saving myself for you, just you, 
 No one but you
 I've saved my heart in your name
 It's for you to claim some day
 Been behaving myself for you, just you, 
 No one but you
 Because you'd never forgive
 A kiss I might give away
 I'll keep myself to myself
 And in the long run I'll win
 I'll keep myself to myself
 Because I know that you've been
 Saving your love for me, just me, 
 And come what may
 Until we're together
 I'm saving myself for you
 
 
 Say it isn't so,
 
 Say it isn't so,
 Everyone is saying
 You don't love me,
 Say it isn't so.
 
 Everywhere I go,
 Everyone I know,
 
 Whispers that you're growing tired of me,
 Say it isn't so.
 People say that you,
 
 Found somebody new,
 And it won't be long
 Before you leave me,
 Say it isn't true,
 
 Say that everything is still okay,
 That's all I want to know,
 
 And what they're saying,
 Say it isn't so
 
 Up in the mornin' and out to school
 The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule
 American history and practical math
 You studyin' hard and hopin' to pass
 Workin' your fingers right down to the bone
 And the guy behind you won't leave you alone
 
 Ring, ring goes the bell
 The cook in the lunch room's ready to sell
 You're lucky if you can find a seat
 You're fortunate if you have time to eat
 Back in the classroom, open your books
 Keep up the teacher, don't know how mean she looks
 
 Soon as three o'clock rolls around
 You finally lay your burden down
 Close up your books, get out of your seat
 Down the halls and into the street
 Up to the corner and 'round the bend
 Right to the juke joint, you go in
 
 Drop the coin right into the slot
 You're gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
 With the one you love, you're makin' romance
 All day long you been wantin' to dance
 Feeling the music from head to toe
 'Round and 'round and 'round we go
 
 Hail, hail, rock and roll
 Deliver me from the days of old
 Long live rock and roll
 The beat of the drums, loud and bold
 Rock, rock, rock and roll
 The feelin' is there, body and soul
 
 See see rider 
 See what you have done, Lord, Lord, Lord 
 Made me love you, now your gal has come 
 You made me love you, now your gal has come 
 
 I'm goin' away, baby, I won't be back till fall, Lord, Lord, Lord 
 Goin' away, baby, won't be back till fall 
 If I find me a good man, won't be back at all 
 I'm gonna buy me a pistol, just as long as I am tall, Lord, Lord, Lord 
 Shoot my man, and catch a cannonball 
 If he won't have me, he won't have no gal at all 
 
 See See Rider, where did you stay last night? Lord, Lord, Lord 
 Your shoes ain't buttoned and your clothes don't fit you right 
 You didn't come home till the sun was shining bright
 
 Gonna take a sentimental journey
 Gonna set my heart at ease
 Gonna make a sentimental journey
 To renew old memories
 
 Got my bag, got my reservation
 Spent each dime I could afford
 Like a child in wild anticipation
 Long to hear that "All aboard"
 
 Seven, that's the time we leave, at seven
 I'll be waitin' up for heaven
 Countin' every mile of railroad track
 That takes me back
 
 Never thought my heart could be so 'yearny'
 Why did I decide to roam?
 Gotta take that sentimental journey
 Sentimental journey home,
 
 Sentimental journey!
 
 Oh, it's a long, long while
 From May to December
 But the days grow short
 When you reach September
 When the autumn weather
 Turns the leaves to flame
 One hasn't got time
 For the waiting game
 Oh, the days dwindle down
 To a precious few
 September
 November
 And these few precious days
 I'll spend with you
 These precious days
 I'll spend with you
 
 Shake down the stars, pull down the clouds
 Turn off the moon, do it soon
 I can't enjoy this night without you
 Shake down the stars
 Dry up the streams
 Stop all my dreams.
 
 Cut off the breeze, do it please
 I never thought I'd cry about you
 Shake down the stars
 I gave you my arms, my lips, my heart
 My love, my life, my all
 But the best that I had to offer you
 I found was all too small
 Crush every rose, hush ev'ry prayer
 Break every vow, do it now
 I know I can't go on without you
 Shake down the stars
 
 Drop that long face
 Come on have your fling
 Why keep nursing the blues?
 If you want this old world on a string
 
 Put on your dancing shoes
 Stop wasting time
 Put on your dancing shoes
 Watch your spirits climb
 
 Shall we dance
 Or keep on mopin'?
 Shall we dance
 And walk on air?
 
 Shall we give in to despair?
 Or shall we dance with never a care?
 Life is short
 We're growing older
 
 Don't you be an also-ran
 You'd better dance, little lady
 Dance, little man
 Dance whenever you can.
 
 She didn't say yes
 She didn't say no
 She didn't say stay
 She didn't say go
 
 She only knew that he had spied her there
 And then she knew he sat beside her there
 
 At first there was heard not one little word
 Then coyly she took one sly little look
 And something awoke and smiled inside
 Her heart began beating wild inside
 
 So what did she do?
 I leave it to you
 She did just what you'd do too
 
 She didn't say yes
 She didn't say no
 They very soon stood beside his chateau
 They lingered like two poor waifs outside
 For well she knew `twas only safe outside
 
 In there it was warm, out there it was cold
 The sleet and the storm said, "Better be bold"
 She murmured, "I'm not afraid of ice,
 I only wish that I was made of ice"
 
 So what did she do?
 I leave it to you
 She did just what you'd do too
 
 She didn't say yes
 She didn't say no
 She wanted to stay
 But knew she should go
 
 She wasn't so sure that he'd be good
 She wasn't even sure that she'd be good
 
 She wanted to rest
 All cuddled and pressed
 A palpable part of somebody's heart
 She'd love to be on rapport with him
 But not behind a bolted door with him
 
 And what did she do?
 I leave it to you
 She did just what you'd do too
 
 She didn't say yes
 She didn't say no
 For heaven was near
 She wanted it so
 
 Above her sweet love was beckoning
 And yet she knew there'd be a reckoning
 
 She wanted to climb
 But dreaded to fall
 So bided her time
 And clung to the wall
 
 She wanted to act ad libitum
 But feared to lose her equilibrium
 
 So what did she do?
 I leave it to you
 She did just what you'd do too
 
 Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
 Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
 Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
 I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.
 
 I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
 Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
 I got a woman crazy for me
 She's funny that way.
 
 I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
 She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
 I got a woman crazy for me
 She's funny that way.
 
 Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
 She'd be so much better off if I went away.
 
 But why should I leave her, why should I go
 She'd be unhappy without me I know
 I got a woman crazy for me
 She's funny that way.
 
 She should have the very best, Anyone can see
 Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
 While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
 Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 
 
 Never had nothin'; no one to care
 That's why I seem to have more than my share,
 I got a woman, crazy for me,
 She's funny that way.
 
 When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
 Her only answer is one little smile,
 I got a woman crazy for me.
 She's funny that way.
 
 I can see no other way and no better plan,
 End it all and let her go to some better man;
 But I'm only human, coward at best
 I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
 I got a woman crazy for me,
 She's funny that way.
 
 'Cause my hair is curly
 Just because my teeth are pearly
 Just because I always wear a smile
 Like to dress up in the latest style
 
 'Cause I'm glad I'm livin'
 I take these troubles all with a smile
 Just because my color's shady
 That's the difference, maybe, why they call me
 
 Shine, sway your bluesies
 Why don't you shine?
 Start with your shoesies
 Shine each place up, make it look like new
 Shine your face up; I want to see you wear a smile or two
 
 Why don't you shine your these and thoseies?
 You'll find everything gonna turn out right fine
 Folks will shine up to ya
 Everybody's gonna howdy doody do-ya
 You'll make the whole world shine
 
 Oh, chocolate drop, that's me
 
 'Cause my hair is curly 
 Now just because my teeth are pearly 
 Just because I always wear a smile 
 Like to dress us, babe, in the latest style
 
 'Cause I'm glad I'm livin'
 I take these troubles all with a smile
 Now just because my color's shady 
 That's the difference, maybe, why they call me
 
 Shine away your bluesies
 Shine, start with your shoesies
 You'll make the whole world shine
 
 Those silk shiny stockings
 That I wear when I'm with you
 I wear 'cause you told me
 That you dig that crazy hue
 
 Do we feel the romance
 When we go to the dance
 Oh no, you take a glance
 At those shiny stockings
 
 Then came along some chick
 With great big stockings, too
 When you changed your mind about me
 Why, I never knew
 
 I guess I'll have to find
 A new, a new kind
 A guy who digs my shiny stockings, too
 
 Then came along some chick
 With great big stockings, too
 When you changed your mind about me
 Why, I never knew
 
 I guess I'll have to find
 A new, a new kind
 A guy who digs my shiny stockings, too
 A new guy who digs my shiny stockings, too

 My heart crossed your name off the door
 Signing off
 Now that I've told you
 That this is just where I came in

 A person to person romance

 My trip to the stars took a spill
 We're all through

 I know that it's something to treasure
 From here to the ends of the earth

 And be sure I won't forget you
 The best of everything until then

 Silent night, holy night
 All is calm, all is bright
 'Round yon virgin mother and child
 Holy infant so tender and mild
 Sleep in heavenly peace
 Sleep in heavenly peace
 
 Silent night, holy night
 Shepherds quake at the sight
 Glorious strains from Heaven afar
 Heavenly Hosts sing alleluia
 Christ the Savior is born
 Christ the Savior is born
 
 City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
 Dressed in holiday style
 In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
 
 Children laughing, people passing
 Meeting smile after smile
 And on every street corner you'll hear
 
 Silver bells, silver bells
 It's Christmas time in the city
 Ring-a-ling, hear them sing
 Soon it will be Christmas day
 
 Strings of street lights, even stop lights
 Blink a bright red and green
 As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
 
 Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
 This is Santa's big scene
 And above all this bustle you'll hear
 
 You made me leave my happy home
 You took my love and now you're gone
 Since I fell for you
 
 Love brings such misery and pain
 I guess I'll never be the same
 Since I fell for you
 
 Oh, it's too bad; oh, it's so sad
 I'm in love with you
 You love me, then you snub me
 But what can I do?
 I'm so in love with you
 
 Oh, I guess I'll never see the light
 I get the blues 'bout every night
 Since I fell for you
 
 Well, it's too bad; oh, it's so sad
 That I'm in love with you
 Oh, you love me, then you snub me
 Oh, but what can I do
 I'm so in love with you
 
 Oh, I guess I'll never see the light
 I get the blues 'bout every night
 Since I fell for you
 Since I fell for you
 
 Give me a song that's robust
 Feeling the way I am
 Any old band'll go bust
 If it ain't got that jam
 
 When a body needs a body
 On the ballroom floor
 Then a body asks a body
 "What's a swing band for?"
 
 Oh baby, I don't want you
 To croon soft and mellow
 Let me warn you in advance
 Sing me a swing song and let me dance
 
 Oh baby, I don't want
 Any moon, bright and yellow
 You can have your sweet romance
 Sing me a swing song and let me dance
 
 Mr. Trombone, play some corn
 I ain't carin' what notes
 Mr. Trumpet, grab a horn
 Brother, give me hot notes
 
 Oh baby, I don't want
 Any tune on a cello
 Give the rhythm men a chance
 Sing me a swing song and let me dance
 
 Let me warn you in advance
 Sing me a swing song and let me dance
 You can have your sweet romance, just
 Sing me a swing song and let me dance
 
 Mr. Trombone, play some corn
 I ain't carin' what notes
 Mr. Trumpet, grab a horn
 Brother, give me hot notes
 
 Oh baby, I don't want
 Any tune on a cello
 Give the rhythm men a chance
 Sing me a swing song and let me dance
 
 Ol' Chick Webb is beatin' it out
 Makes me feel like I want to shout
 All the boys are ready to prance, so
 Sing me a swing song and let me dance
 
 Give me a song that's robust
 Feeling the way I am
 Any old band'll go bust

 Go on and sing my heart
 You know it's spring my heart
 So why not show it?
 
 Pretend you're glad my heart
 Although you're sad my heart
 He mustn't know it
 
 Remember, love is not an easy game
 No two hearts ever beat quite the same
 
 Go on and dance my heart
 Our only chance my heart
 Is to forget it
 
 Should you despair my heart
 He'll know we care my heart
 And we'll regret it
 
 If it's to be, we soon shall see
 And if it's not to be,
 No power on earth can make it so
 
 Pretend it's spring my heart
 Go on and sing my heart
 For if you sing, he'll never know
 
 Go on and dance my heart
 Our only chance my heart
 Is to forget it
 
 Should you despair my heart
 He'll know we care my heart
 And we'll regret it
 
 If it's to be, we soon shall see
 And if it's not to be,
 No power on earth can make it so
 
 Pretend it's spring my heart
 Go on and sing my heart
 For if you sing, he'll never know

 Skylark
 Have you anything to say to me?
 Won't you tell me where my love can be?
 Is there a meadow in the mist
 Where someone's waiting to be kissed?
 
 Skylark
 Have you seen a valley green with spring?
 Where my heart can go a journeying
 Over the shadows and the rain
 To a blossom covered lane
 
 And in your lonely flight
 Haven't you heard the music in the night?
 Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
 Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon
 
 Oh skylark
 I don't know if you can find these things
 But my heart is riding on your wings
 So if you see them anywhere
 Won't you lead me there?
 
 Oh skylark

 Sleep, my little Jesus
 On Thy bed of hay
 While the shepherds homeward
 Journey on their way
 
 Mother is Thy shepherd
 And will her vigil keep
 Did the voices wake Thee?
 Oh sleep, my Jesus, sleep!
 
 Softly sleep, sweetly sleep
 My Jesus, sleep!
 
 Sleep, my little Jesus
 While Thou art my own!
 Ox and ass Thy neighbors
 Shalt Thou have a throne?
 
 Will they call me blessed?
 Shall I stand and weep?
 Be it far, Jehovah!
 Oh sleep, my Jesus, sleep!
 
 Softly sleep, sweetly sleep
 My Jesus, sleep!
 
 Sleep, my little Jesus
 Wonder-baby mine!
 Well the singing angels
 Greet Thee as divine
 
 Through my heart, as heaven
 Low the echoes sweep
 Of glory to Jehovah!
 Oh sleep, my Jesus, sleep!
 
 Softly sleep, sweetly sleep
 My Jesus, sleep!
 
 Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring ting tingling, too
 Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
 Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "yoo hoo"
 Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
 
 Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go
 Let's look at the show
 We're riding in a wonderland of snow
 Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, it's grand
 Just holding your hand
 
 We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland
 Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy, cozy are we
 We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
 Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
 Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
 
 Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go
 Let's look at the show
 We're riding in a wonderland of snow
 Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, it's grand

 Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
 We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
 Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
 Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
 Sleigh ride together with you
 Sleigh ride together with you
 Sleigh ride together with you
 
 Put on your slumming clothes and get your car
 Let's go sightseeing where the high-toned people are
 Come on, there's lots of fun in store for you
 See how the other half lives on park avenue
 
 Let's go slumming, take me slumming
 Let's go slumming on park avenue
 
 Let us hide behind a pair of fancy glasses
 And make faces when a member of the classes passes
 
 Let's go smelling where they're dwelling
 Sniffing everything the way they do
 
 Let us go to it, they do it
 Why can't we do it too? 
 Let's go slumming, nose thumbing, on park avenue
 
 Let's go slumming, take me slumming
 Let's go slumming on park avenue
 
 Where the social hearts for Broadway lights are throbbing
 And they spend their nights in smart cafes hobnobbing, snobbing
 
 Come let's eye them, pass right by them
 Looking down our noses as they do
 
 Let us go to it, they do it
 Why can't we do it too? 
 Let's go slumming, crumb bumming, on park avenue
 
 Pick me a town in any clime
 Where people like a rockin time
 And stay awake both day and night
 Till everybody's feelin good an' right
 
 Then throw me 
 I wanna be 
 Ahhhhh, smack dab in the middle, boys now
 So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul
 
 Ten Cadillacs, a diamond mill
 Ten suits of clothes to dress to kill
 A ten room house, some Bar B Q
 And fifty chicks not over twenty-two
 
 Then throw me 
 Oh, I wanna be 
 Ahhhhh, now boys you can see why
 I wanna be smack dab in the middle now
 So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul
 
 One hundred beds with chorus girls
 A street that's paved with natural pearls
 A wagon load of bonds and stocks
 Then open up the door at Fort Knox
 
 Then throw me 
 I wanna be 
 Ahhhhh, now listen boys throw me
 Smack dab in the middle right now
 So Ray can rock and roll to satisfy his soul
 
 That's all right!
 
 A lot of bread and gangs of meat
 Oodles of butter and somethin sweet
 Gallons of coffee to wash it down
 Bicarbonated soda by the pound
 
 Then throw me 
 I picture it 
 Ah, throw me now, smack dab in the middle right now
 So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul
 
 Alright!
 
 We didn't break apart in stormy weather
 We didn't run around like others do
 Now we're not afraid when storm clouds gather
 'Cause we got the kind of love that'll see us through
 
 We've got smooth sailing, sailing
 Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone
 Smooth sailing, sailing
 And a blue sky full of rainbows from now on
 
 We find each others arms in troubled waters
 We found that's the safest place to go
 From now we can laugh at troubled waters
 'Cause our roughest storms just seem to make love grow

 My dear, I've a feeling you are
 So near and yet so far
 You appear like a radiant star
 First so near then again so far
 
 I just start getting you keen
 On clinches galore with me
 When fate steps in on the scene
 And mops up the floor with me
 No wonder I'm a bit under par
 For you're so near and yet so far
 
 My condition is only so-so
 'Cause whenever I feel you're close, oh
 You turn out to be, oh, so far
 
 I just start getting you keen
 On clinches galore with me

 And mops up the floor with me

 'Cause whenever I feel you're close, oh
 You turn out to be, oh, so far
 
 What is so rare as a day in June?
 'Till now we have never been told
 The old question's answered by one that is new
 What is so rare, dear, as you?
 
 So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
 Sweet as a breath of air
 Fresh with the morning dew
 So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
 Orchids in cellophane 
 Couldn't compare to you 
 You are perfection you're my idea 
 Of angels singing the Ave Maria
 For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
 With every beat of the heart that I give you 
 So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share
 Caring the way we care
 Ours is a love so rare
 
 So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
 Charming and debonaire
 Those are the words for you
 So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
 That "one in a million" air
 In everything you do
 You have that something, that certain manner
 You thrill me more than the "Star Spangled Banner"
 You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
 And in that love scene I gladly surrender
 So rare, to have a future like yours to share
 Sweetheart the way we care
 
 In my solitude
 You haunt me
 With dreadful ease
 Of days gone by
 
 In my solitude
 You taunt me
 With memories
 That never die
 
 I sit in my chair
 And filled with despair
 There's no one could be so sad
 With gloom everywhere
 I sit and I stare
 I know that I'll soon go mad
 
 In my solitude
 I'm afraid
 Dear Lord above
 Send back my love
 I sit in my chair
 
 Filled with despair
 There's no one, no one
 No onecould be so sad
 With gloom everywhere
 I sit and I stare
 I know that I'll soon go mad
 
 In my solitude
 I'm afraid
 Dear Lord above
 Send back my love
 
 Some of these days
 You're gonna miss me, baby
 Some of these days
 You'll feel so lonely
 
 You're gonna miss my huggin'
 You'll miss my kissin'
 You may even miss me, baby
 When I'm gone away
 
 You're gonna feel lonely
 And want me only
 'Cause you know, honey
 You always got your way
 
 Say, baby, if you really want me, oh yeah
 You know it's gonna grieve me
 You're gonna miss your boney little daddy
 'Cause one of these, ah yeah
 
 Said, some of these days 
 You're gonna miss me, honey
 And I'm talkin' about days
 When you feel all blue
 
 You're gonna miss my huggin'
 You're gonna miss my kissin'
 You may even miss me, baby
 When I'm long gone away, ah
 
 I hope you feel lonely
 And want me only
 'Cause you know, lover
 Ya always had your way
 
 And if you leave me
 You know it's gonna grieve me
 You'll miss your brown-eyed daddy 
 Some of these days
 
 Some other spring
 I'll try to love
 Now I still cling
 To faded blossoms
 Fresh from worn
 Left crushed and torn
 Like the love affair I mourn
 
 Some other spring
 When twilight falls
 Will the night bring
 Another to me?
 
 Not your kind
 But let me find
 It's not true that love is blind
 Sunshine's around me 
 But deep in my heart it's cold as ice
 Love, once you've found me
 But can that story unfold twice?
 
 Some other spring
 Will my heart awake?
 Stirring to sing
 Love's magic music
 Then forget the old duet
 Love in some other spring?
 Spring?
 
 When a body knows nobody, what's a body to do?
 Shall she weep and sigh?
 No, no, and I'll tell you why
 
 Someday, there must come somebody
 Bringing heaven in view
 And so her courage, she must keep
 As she sings herself to sleep
 
 Somebody from somewhere
 Will appear someday
 I don't know just from where
 But he's on his way
 
 I'll just keep on waiting
 Waiting 'till I see
 Somebody from somewhere
 For nobody but me
 
 I'll just keep on waiting
 Waiting 'till I see
 Somebody from somewhere
 For nobody but me
 
 Somebody loves me
 I wonder who
 I wonder who she can be;
 
 Somebody loves me
 I wish I knew,
 Who can she be worries me
 
 For every girl who passes me
 I shout, hey! maybe,
 You were meant to be my loving baby;
 
 Somebody loves me
 I wonder who,
 Maybe it's you.
 
 I'm somebody nobody loves
 Oh me oh my my my
 I'm somebody nobody loves
 I wonder why why why
 
 Although I know it sounds alarming
 I've prayed on bended knee
 For that certain gay Prince Charming
 Who was meant for me
 
 I've got to find me a somebody soon
 Or else I'll die die die
 I take the man in the moon
 If he would give me a try
 I'm just a lonely Cinderella
 That romance passes by
 I'm somebody nobody loves
 Oh me oh my
 
 If you feel the fates are against you
 'Cause the best things in life pass you by
 Look at me
 Look at me
 
 I've sent lots of letters to cupid
 But he's a hard-to-get guy
 Look at me 
 Oh, look at me
 
 I'm somebody nobody loves
 Oh me oh my my my
 I'm somebody nobody loves
 I wonder why why why
 
 Although I know it sounds alarming
 I've prayed on bended knee
 For that certain gay Prince Charming
 Who was meant for me
 
 I've got to find me a somebody soon
 Or else I'll die die die
 I take the man in the moon
 If he would give me a try
 I'm just a lonely Cinderella
 That romance passes by
 I'm somebody nobody loves
 Oh me oh my
 
 There's a saying old, says that love is blind
 Still we're often told, seek and ye shall find
 So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
 
 Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
 He's the big affair I cannot forget
 Only man I ever think of with regret
 
 I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
 Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb
 
 There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
 I hope that he turns out to be
 Someone who'll watch over me
 
 I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
 I know I could, always be good
 To one who'll watch over me
 
 Although he may not be the man
 Some girls think of as handsome
 To my heart he carries the key
 
 Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
 Follow my lead, oh, how I need
 Someone to watch over me
 
 Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
 Follow my lead, oh, how I need
 Someone to watch over me
 
 Someone to watch over me
 
 Something in the way he moves
 Attracts me like no other lover
 Something in the way that he woos me
 Don't want to leave him now
 Better believe, and how
 
 Somewhere in his smile he knows
 I don't need no other lover
 Something in his style that shows me
 Don't want to leave him now
 Better believe, and how
 
 You're asking me, will my love grow?
 Well, I don't know, no, I don't know
 You stick around, Jack; it might show
 I don't know, no, I don't know
 
 Something in the way he knows
 All I gotta do is just think of him
 Something in the things that he shows me
 Don't want to leave him now
 Better believe, and how
 
 You're asking me will my love grow
 I don't know, no, I don't know
 But you hang around, Jack, it might show
 I don't know, no, I don't know
 
 Something in the way he knows me
 And all I gotta do is just think of him
 Something in those things that he shows me
 Don't want to leave him now
 Better believe, and how
 
 I don't plan to leave him now
 
 I have almost everything a human could desire
 Cars and houses, bear skin rugs to place before my fire
 But there's somethin' missin'
 Somethin' isn't there
 It seems I'm never kissin' the one whom I could care for
 
 I want somethin' to live for
 Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
 Oh, what wouldn't I give for
 Someone who'd take my life and make it seem
 Gay as they say it ought to be
 
 Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
 My eyes is watching the noon sun
 Searching the promenades, seeking a clue
 To the one who will always be my
 Somethin' to live for
 I want somethin' to live for
 I want somethin' to live for
 
 Somethings gotta give,
 Somethings gotta give
 Somethings gotta give
 When an irresistible force such as you
 
 Meets and old immovable object like me
 You can bet as sure as you live
 Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
 Something's gotta give.
 
 When an irrepressible smile such as yours
 Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
 Don't say no because I insist.
 Somewhere, somehow,
 Someone's gonna be kissed.
 
 So en garde who knows what the fates have in store
 From their vast mysterious sky?
 I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore
 But how long can anyone try?
 
 Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might,
 Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
 We'll find out as sure as we live
 Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
 Something's gotta give.
 
 Fight, fight, fight it with all of our might,
 Chances are some heavenly star spangled night
 We'll find out as sure as we live
 Something's gotta give, something's gotta give,
 Something's gotta give.
 Something's gotta , something's gotta give
 
 Somewhere in the night, chasing shadows around the bend
 Somewhere in the night, chasing rainbows that have no end
 In the misty night, you are mine and you hold me tight
 
 But dreams have a way of calling it a day
 My dreams have past, they seldom last
 But in my lonely flight, I'll keep searching till day is through
 And somewhere in the night, till I find you
 
 Somewhere in the night, chasing shadows around the bend
 Somewhere in the night, chasing rainbows that have no end
 In the misty night, you are mine and you hold me tight
 
 But dreams have a way of calling it a day
 My dreams have past, they seldom last
 But in my lonely flight, I'll keep searching till day is through
 And somewhere in the night, till I find you
 
 Soon, my dear, you'll never be lonely,
 Soon, you'll find I live for you only.
 When I'm with you who cares what time it is
 Or what the place or what the climate is?
 
 Oh! Soon, our little ship will become sailing
 Home through every storm, never failing,
 The day you're mine this world will be in tune,
 Let's make that day come soon.
 
 Oh! Soon, our little ship will become sailing home

 I think it's 'bout time that you realize
 Your money and your power's got you mesmerized
 
 Pretty lady, get back

 Speak low when you speak, love
 Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
 Speak low when you speak, love
 Our moment is swift; like ships adrift, we're swept apart too soon
 
 Speak low, darling, speak low
 Love is a spark lost in the dark too soon, too soon
 I feel wherever I go
 That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon
 
 Time is so old and love so brief
 Love is pure gold and time a thief
 
 We're late, darling, we're late
 The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
 I wait, darling, I wait
 Will you speak low to me? Speak love to me and soon
 
 Time is so old and love so brief
 Love is pure gold and time a thief
 
 We're late, darling, we're late
 The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
 I wait, darling, I wait
 Will you speak low to me? Speak love to me and soon
 Speak low
 
 What goes up must come down
 Spinning Wheel got to go 'round
 Talkin' 'bout your troubles
 It's a cryin' sin
 Ride a painted pony
 Let the Spinning Wheel spin
 You got no money, you got no home
 Spinning Wheel all alone
 Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you
 You never learn
 Ride a painted pony
 Let the Spinning Wheel turn
 Did you find your directing sign 
 On the straight and narrow highway
 Would you mind a reflecting sign?
 Just let it shine within your mind
 And show you the colors that are real
 Someone is waiting just for you
 Spinning Wheel spinning true
 Drop all you troubles by the river side
 
 Once I was a sentimental thing,
 Threw my heart away each spring,
 Now a spring romance hasn't got a chance
 Promised my first dance to winter,
 All I've got to show?s a splinter for my little fling!
 
 Spring this year has got me feeling like a horse that never left the post,
 I lie in my room staring up at the ceiling,
 Spring can really hang you up the most!
 
 Morning?s kiss wakes tres and flowers,
 And to them I'd like to drink a toast,
 I walk in the park just to kill lonely hours,
 Spring can really hang you up the most.
 
 All afternoon those birds twitter twit,
 I know the tune, "this is love, this is it!"
 Heard it before and I know the score,
 And I've decided that spring is a bore!
 
 Love seemed sure around the new year,
 Now it's April, love is just a ghost,
 Spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear? 
 Spring can really hang you up the most!
 Spring can really hang you up the most!
 
 Spring is here, there?s no mistaking
 Robins building nests from coast to coast;
 My heart tries to sing so they won?t hear it breaking,
 Spring can really hang you up the most!
 
 College boys are writing sonnets,
 In the "tender passion" they're engrossed,
 But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnets,
 Spring can really hang you up the most!
 
 Love came my way, I hope it would last,
 We had our day, now that's all in the past!
 Spring came along a season of son,
 Full of sweet promise but something went wrong!
 
 Doctors once prescribed a tonic,
 "sulfur and molasses" was the dose,
 Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic,
 Spring can really hang you up the most!
 
 All alone, the party's over,
 Old man winter was a gracious host,
 But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
 Spring can really hang you up the most!
 
 Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
 Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
 No desire, no ambition leads me
 Maybe it's because nobody needs me
 Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
 Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
 Maybe it's because nobody loves me
 Spring is here I hear
 
 Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
 Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
 No desire, no ambition leads me
 Maybe it's because nobody needs me
 Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
 Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
 Maybe it's because nobody loves me
 Spring is here I hear
 
 There's a song that's really jumping
 And the fellas say it's Squatty Roo
 And it's really dumping
 La-de-doo
 
 Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
 Want you to know it really is pleasin'
 Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
 Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
 Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
 I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
 Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
 Missing you since you went away
 Singing the blues away each day
 Counting the rights and waiting for you 
 I'm in the mood to let you know 
 I never knew I loved you so 
 Please say you love me too 
 When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
 So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
 Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
 Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
 I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
 Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
 Missing you since you went away
 Singing the blues away each day
 Counting the rights and waiting for you 
 I'm in the mood to let you know 
 I never knew I loved you so 
 Please say you love me too 
 When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
 So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
 I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
 I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
 'Cause my lovin' baby done left this town. 
 
 If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
 If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
 I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway. 
 
 Oh, that St. Louis woman, with her diamond rings, 
 She pulls my man around by her apron strings. 
 And if it wasn't for powder and her store-bought hair, 
 Oh, that man of mine wouldn't go nowhere. 
 
 I got those St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, 
 Oh, my man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
 Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. 
 
 I love my man like a schoolboy loves his pie, 
 Like a Kentucky colonel loves his rocker and rye 
 I'll love my man until the day I die, Lord, Lord. 
 
 I got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, Lord, Lord! 
 That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
 Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me. 
 
 I got those St. Louis blues, I got the blues, I got the blues, I got the blues, 
 My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea, 
 Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me, Lord, Lord!
 
 Let's build a stairway to the stars
 And climb that stairway to the stars
 With love beside us to fill the night with a song
 We'll hear the sound of violins
 Out yonder where the blue begins
 The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
 Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
 Over the rim of the hill?
 Can't we sail away on a little dream 
 And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
 Let's build a stairway to the stars
 A lovely stairway to the stars
 
 And now the purple dusk of twilight time
 Steals across the meadows of my heart
 High up in the sky the little stars climb
 Always reminding me that we're apart
 You wander down the lane and far away
 Leaving me a song that will not die
 Love is now the stardust of yesterday
 The music of the years gone by.
 
 Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
 The lonely nights
 Dreaming of a song
 The melody 
 Haunts my reverie
 And I am once again with you
 When our love was new 
 And each kiss an inspiration
 But that was long ago
 And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
 
 Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
 You are in my arms
 The nightingale 
 Tells his fairytale
 Of paradise, where roses grew
 Though I dream in vain
 In my heart it will remain
 My stardust melody
 The memory of love's refrain.
 
 We lived our little drama
 We kissed in a field of white
 And stars fell on Alabama last night
 I can't forget the glamour
 Your eyes held a tender light
 And stars fell on Alabama last night
 
 I never planned in my imagination
 A situation so heavenly
 A fairy land where no one else could enter
 And in the center just you and me, dear
 My heart beat like a hammer
 My arms wound around you tight
 And stars fell on Alabama last night
 
 I never planned in my imagination
 A situation so heavenly
 A fairy land where no one else could enter
 In the center just you and me, dear
 My heart beat like a hammer
 My arms wound around you tight
 And stars fell on Alabama last night
 
 Yeahh....
 I've got steam heat.
 I've got steam heat.
 I've got steam heat.
 But I need your love to keep away the cold.
 I've got steam heat.
 I've got steam heat.
 I've got steam heat.
 
 But I can't get warm without your hand to hold.
 The radiators hissin still I need your kissing to keep me from freezing each night.
 I've got a hot water bottle, but nothing I've got'll take the place of you holding me tight.
 
 I've got steam heat.
 I've got steam heat.
 I've got steam heat.
 But I need your love to keep away the cold.
 
 They told me to throw some more coal in the boiler.

 They told me to pour some more oil in the burner.

 The song a robin sings,
 Through years of endless springs,
 The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
 That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.
 
 That great symphonic theme,
 That's Stella by starlight,
 And not a dream,
 My heart and I agree,
 She's everything on this earth to me.
 
 That great symphonic theme,

 What made good queen Bess
 Such a great success?
 What made Wellington
 Do what he did at Waterloo?
 
 What makes every Englishman
 A fighter through and through?
 It isn't roast beef, or ale, or home, or mother
 It`s just a little thing they sing to one another
 
 Stiff upper lip, stout fella
 Carry on, old fluff
 Chin up, keep muddling through
 
 Stiff upper lip, stout fella
 When the going`s rough
 Pip pip to old man trouble
 And a toodly-oo too
 
 Carry on through thick and thin
 If you feel you`re in the right
 Does the fighting spirit win?
 Quite, quite, quite, quite, quite
 
 Stiff upper lip, stout fella
 When you`re in the stew
 Sober or blotto, this is your motto
 Keep muddling through
 
 When a bounder starts to hiss
 You must give him blow for blow
 Make the blighter say, "What`s this?
 `ullo, `ullo, `ullo, `ullo, `ullo"
 
 Stiff upper lip, stout fella
 When you`re in the stew
 Sober or blotto, this is your motto
 Keep muddling through
 
 Keep muddling through
 Keep muddling through
 Keep muddling through
 
 Savoy, the home of sweet romance
 Savoy, it wins you at a glance
 Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance
 Your old form just like a clinging vine
 Your lips so warm and sweet as wine
 Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine
 
 How my heart is singing
 While the band is swinging
 Never tired of romping
 And stomping with you at the Savoy
 
 What joy, a perfect holiday
 Savoy, where we can glide and sway
 Savoy, let me stomp away with you
 
 Boo ba di ba di di bo bo bo

 And close to mine, divine
 
 How my heart is singing
 While the band is swinging
 I'm never tired of romping
 And stomping with you at the Savoy
 
  a perfect holiday
 Where we can glide and sway
 Let me stomp away with you
 
 Da ba da ba di da doo loop
 
 What joy to be together at Savoy
 Romping and stomping with you at the Savoy
 Never tired of romping
 And stomping with you
 While the band is romping
 What do we do, what do we do
 
 Jump, jump, jump, jump, swing at the Savoy
 Romp, romp, romp, romp, romp at the Savoy
 
 Could be was it
 Atlantic city
 Lord we would talk about that night
 Yeah we're talking about some boy
 Bet to the Savoy
 Bet to the Savoy
 To the Savoy
 Never romping stomp away
 We're shakin' at the Savoy
 You shake my hand
 
 He's stone-cold dead in de market
 He's stone-cold dead in de market
 He's stone-cold dead in de market
 I killed nobody but me husband
 
 Last night I went out drinking
 When I came home, I gave her a beating
 So she catch up the rolling pin and went to work on my head
 Till she bash it in
 
 I lie cold dead in de market
 Stone-cold dead in de market
 I lie cold dead in de market
 She killed nobody but her husband
 
 I lick him wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
 I lick him wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
 I lick him wit' thee pot and thee fryin' pan
 And if I kill him, he had it coming
 
 Man, he's stone-cold dead in de market
 He's stone-cold dead in de market
 He's stone-cold dead in de market
 I killed nobody but me husband
 
 My family they swearin' to kill her
 My family they swearin' to kill her
 His family they swearin' to kill me
 And if I kill him, he had it coming
 
 I lie cold dead in the market, child
 Cold dead in the market, child

 Man, he's stone-cold dead in de market
 He's stone-cold dead in de market

 You stone-cold dead in de market, murderer
 Stone-cold dead in de market, de criminal
 He's stone-cold dead in de market
 I killed nobody but me husband
 
 A-Tisket A-Tasket
 A green and yellow basket
 I bought a basket for my mommie
 On the way I dropped it
 I dropped it, I dropped it
 Yes on the way I dropped it
 A little girlie picked it up
 And took it to the market
 She was truckin' on down the 
 Avenue without a single thing to do
 She was peck, peck, peckin' all around
 When she spied it on the ground
 A-Tisket A-Tasket
 She took my yellow basket 
 And if she doesn't bring it back
 I think that I shall die
 
 No, no, no, no
 
 No, no, no, no
 
 No, no, no, no
 Just a little yellow basket
 
 The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
 The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
 The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
 The monkey grabbed his neck and said, "Now, listen, Jack
 Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
 Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
 Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?
 Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top"
 The buzzard told the monkey, "You're choking me
 Release your hold and I'll set you free"
 The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
 "Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie"
 Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and stay right
 Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
 
 Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
 Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
 Your new dreams for old
 I know where they're bought
 I know where they're sold
 Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
 And you'll be met there by others like you
 Brothers as blue
 Smiling on the street of dreams
 
 Love laughs at a king
 Kings don't mean a thing
 On the street of dreams
 Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
 On the street of dreams
 Gold, sliver and gold
 All you can hold is in the moonbeams
 Poor, no one is poor
 Long as love is sure
 On the street of dreams
 
 Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
 Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
 It's ringing with cheer
 'Cause yesterday's gone
 Tomorrow is near
 Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
 Things will be brighter the moment you find
 More of your kind
 Smiling on the street of dreams
 
 Love laughs at a king
 Kings don't mean a thing
 On the street of dreams
 Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
 On the street of dreams
 Gold, sliver and gold
 All you can hold is in the moonbeams
 Poor, no one is poor
 Long as love is sure
 On the street of dreams
 
 I didn't get my Dixie drawl
 A-drinkin' out of a Dixie cup
 Yes sir, I'm strictly from Dixie
 And when I say, "I loves you all"
 
 It's meant to be on the up-and-up
 Yes sir, I'm strictly from Dixie
 When I came up from the South
 I felt so down in the mouth
 
 Then I took one look at you
 And thought about Dixie skies of blue
 I thought about sweet magnolias too
 I never missed a cotton bowl
 
 I like my tulips a trifle tall
 Yes sir, I'm strictly from Dixie
 
 Let the drums roll out
 Let the trumpet call
 While the people shout
 "strike up the band"
 
 Hear the cymbals ring
 Callin' one and all
 To the martial swing,
 Strike up the band
 
 There is work to be done, to be done
 There's a war to be won, to be won
 Come, you son of a son of a gun,
 Take your stand
 
 Fall in line, yea a bow
 Come along, let's go
 Hey, leader, strike up the band!
 
 There is work to be done, to be done
 There's a war to be won, to be won
 Come, you son of a son of a gun,
 Take your stand
 
 Fall in line, yea a bow
 Come on, let's go
 Hey, leader, strike up
 Hey, leader, strike up
 Hey, leader, strike up the band
 
 Have you heard these blues
 That I'm gonna sing to you
 When you hear them they will thrill you 
 Through and through 
 There the sweetest blues you ever heard
 Now listen and don't say a word
 
 Sugar blues 
 Everybody's singing the sugar blues
 The whole towns ringing
 My loving man sweet as can be 
 But the doggone fools 
 Turned sour on me
 I'm so unhappy 
 Feel so unhappy 
 I could lay me down a die
 You could say what you choose
 But I'm all confused
 I got the sweet, sweet sugar blues 
 More sugar 
 I've got the sugar blues
 
 Sugar blues
 Every singing the sugar blues
 My loving man sweet as can be 
 But the doggone fools 
 Turned sour on me
 I'm so unhappy 
 Feel so unhappy 
 I could lay me down a die
 You could say what you choose
 But I'm all confused
 I got the sweet, sweet sugar blues 
 More sugar 
 I've got the sugar blues
 
 Yea!
 
 Gonna get out my sycamore and shine up my shoes
 Meet my baby and tell her the news
 I bet my bundle on a swayback nag
 And I came home winner with a plenty of swag
 
 One foot, two foot, slew foot, drag
 Swing your honey to the Sugarfoot Rag
 Dig a little jig with a zig and a zag
 And listen to the guitar play the Sugarfoot Rag
 
 I got a big jug of cider and a bottle of wine
 One's for and honey and the other is mine
 Sip on the cider and sip on the wine
 Both sip together and a have a good time
 
 One foot, two foot, slew foot, drag
 Gonna spend all my money and a git on a Jag
 Swing my honey to the Sugarfoot Rag
 
 Walk right up and stomp on the floor
 And swing up the middle with a shoe-fly four

 Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
 Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
 
 Oh, the dark days are done and the bright days are here
 My sunny one shines so sincere
 Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you
 
 Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
 Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way
 
 You gave to me your all and all
 Now I feel ten feet tall
 Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you
 
 Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
 Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
 
 My life was torn like wind-blown sand
 Then a rock was formed when we held hands
 Sunny one so true, I love you
 
 Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
 Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
 
 You're my spark of nature's fire
 You're my sweet complete desire
 Sunny one so true, I love you
 
 It's getting near dawn
 When lights close their tired eyes
 I'll soon be with you my love
 To give you my dawn surprise
 
 I'll be with you darling soon
 I'll be with you when the stars start falling
 
 I've been waiting so long
 To be where I'm going
 There, in the sunshine of your love
 
 I'm with you my love
 The light's shining through on you
 Yes, I'm with you my love
 It's the morning and just we two
 
 I'll stay with you darling now
 I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up
 
 I've been waiting so long
 To be where I'm going
 There in the sunshine of your love
 
 I'm with you my love
 The light's shining through on you
 Yes, I'm with you my love
 It's the morning and just we two
 
 I'll stay with you darling now
 I'll stay with you till my seas are dried up
 
 I've been waiting so long
 I've been waiting so long
 I've been waiting so long
 To be where I'm going
 There, in the sunshine of your love
 
 Supper time
 I should set the table
 'Cause it's supper time
 Somehow I'm not able
 'Cause that man o'mine
 Ain't comin' home no more
 
 Supper time
 Kids will soon be yellin'
 For their supper time
 How'll I keep from tellin'
 Them that man o'mine
 Ain't comin' home no more?
 
 How'll I keep explainin' when they ask me where he's gone?
 How'll I keep from cryin' when I bring their supper on?
 How can I remind them to pray at their humble board?
 How can I be thankful when they start to thank the lord
 Lord!
 
 Supper time
 I should set the table
 'Cause it's supper time
 Somehow I'm not able
 'Cause that man o'mine
 Ain't comin' home no more
 
 Sweet and lovely
 Sweeter than the roses in May
 Sweet and lovely
 Heaven must have sent him my way
 
 Skies above me
 Never were as blue as his eyes
 And he loves me
 Who would want a sweeter surprise?
 
 When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
 There's a thrill that words cannot express
 In my heart a song of love is taunting me
 Melody haunting me
 
 Sweet and lovely
 Sweeter than the roses in May
 And he loves me
 There is nothing more I can say
 
 When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
 There's a thrill that words cannot express
 In my heart a song of love is taunting me
 Melody haunting me
 
 Sweet and lovely
 Sweeter than the roses in May
 And he loves me
 There is nothing more I can say
 
 There is nothing more I can say
 There is nothing more I can say
 There is nothing more I can say
 There is nothing more I can say
 
 
 
 Every star above
 Knows the one I love
 Sweet Sue, just you
 
 And the moon on high
 Knows the reason why
 Sweet Sue, is you
 
 No one else it seems
 Ever shared my dreams
 Without you I don't know what I'd do
 
 In this heart of mine
 You live all the time
 Oh, Sue, just you
 
 So you think I'll sit around and cry
 The day you say, "Toodle-ooo, goodbye"
 Oh yes?
 Take another guess
 
 Oh, you think no one can fill your shoes
 And when you're gone, then I'll have the blues
 Oh yes?
 Take another guess
 
 If you go your way
 Then I'll go my way
 And if you do as well as I do
 Honey, you'll do okay
 
 Oh, you think I'll die of loneliness
 And the deep blue sea is my next address
 Oh yes?
 Take another guess
 
 Don't ya hear me talkin' to ya?
 Take another guess
 
 If you think that I'll be blue
 Take another guess
 
 If you go your way
 Then I'll go my way
 And if you do as well as I do
 Honey, you'll do okay
 
 Oh, you think I'll die of loneliness
 And the deep blue sea is my next address
 Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes?
 Take another guess
 
 Easy
 Take love easy, easy easy
 Never let your feelings show
 Make it breezy, breezy breezy
 Easy come and easy go
 
 Never smile too brightly brightly
 When your heart is riding high
 Let your heart break oh-so slightly
 When your baby says goodbye
 
 That well known flame is mighty hot
 As all of us have learned
 So handle it with velvet gloves
 And you won`t get your fingers burned
 
 Take love easy, easy
 On the free and easy plan
 And if you can't take it easy
 Take it easy as you can
 
 Take love easy, easy
 Never let your feelings show
 Make it breezy, breezy, easy
 Easy, easy come and easy go
 
 Never smile too brightly brightly
 When your heart is riding high
 Let your heart break, oh so slightly
 When your baby says goodbye
 
 That well known flame is mighty hot
 As all of us have learned
 So handle it, handle it with velvet gloves
 And you won`t get your fingers burned
 
 Take love easy, easy easy
 On the free and easy plan
 And if you can`t take it easy
 Take it easy as you can
 
 Take it easy
 Take it easy
 Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy, take it easy
 
 You must take the "A" train
 To go to Sugar Hill, way up in Harlem
 If you miss the "A" train
 You'll find you missed the quickest way to Harlem
 
 Hurry, get on, now it's coming
 Listen to those rails a-thrumming
 All aboard, get on the "A" train
 Soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem
 
 You must take the "A" train
 To go to Sugar Hill, way up in Harlem
 You must take the "A" train
 To go to Sugar Hill, way up in Harlem
 If you miss the "A" train
 You'll miss the quickest way to Harlem
 
 Hurry, get on board, it's comin'
 Listen to those rails a-thrumming
 All aboard, get on the "A" train
 Soon you will be on Sugar Hill in Harlem
 
 Harlem, boy
 Next stop is Harlem
 Next stop, Harlem
 Come on, get aboard the "A" train
 
 Get aboard
 Next stop is Harlem
 Take the "A" train
 
 Here I go again
 I hear those trumpets blow again
 All aglow again
 Taking a chance on love
 
 Here I slide again
 About to take that ride again
 Starry-eyed again
 Taking a chance on love
 
 I thought that cards were a frame-up
 I never would try
 But now I'm taking the game up
 And the ace of hearts is high
 
 Things are mending now
 I see a rainbow blending now
 We'll have a happy ending now
 Taking a chance on love
 
 Here I slip again
 About to take that tip again
 Got my grip again
 Taking a chance on love
 
 Now I prove again
 That I can make life move again
 In the grove again
 Taking a chance on love
 
 I walk around with a horseshoe
 In clover I lie
 And, brother rabbit, of course you
 Better kiss your foot goodbye
 
 On the ball again
 I'm riding for a fall again
 I'm gonna give my all again
 Taking a chance on love
 
 
 Picture you upon my knee
 Just tea for two
 And two for tea
 Just me for you
 And you for me alone
 
 Nobody near us to see us or hear us
 No friends or relations
 On weekend vacations
 We won't have it known, dear
 That we own a telephone, dear
 
 Day will break and you'll awake
 And start to bake a sugar cake
 For me to take for all the boys to see
 We will raise a family
 A boy for you, a girl for me
 Oh, can't you see how happy we would be
 
 I wanna cry because I'm blue
 But I can't cry like others do
 I'd feel much better and I'd try
 Somebody, teach me how to cry
 
 I've been in love a time or two
 To lose a love is nothing new
 But every time my tears are dry
 Won't someone teach me how to cry?
 
 It may be that I'm too young
 To know the meaning of the blues
 If I could throw away the pride
 That's hidden deep inside
 The tears in my heart I could lose
 
 I wish someone would come along
 And make my life a happy song
 I'd weep and tell the blues goodbye
 Somebody, teach me how to cry
 
 It may be that I'm too young
 To know the meaning of the blues
 If I could throw away the pride
 That's hidden deep inside
 The tears in my heart I could lose
 
 I wish someone would come along
 And make my life a happy song
 I'd weep and tell the blues goodbye
 Somebody, teach me how to cry
 
 Did you say that I've got a lot to learn?
 Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
 Since this is the perfect spot to learn
 Teach me tonight
 
 Starting with the A-B-C of it
 Getting right down to the X-Y-Z of it
 Help me solve the mystery of it
 Teach me tonight
 
 The sky's a blackboard high above you
 And if a shooting star goes by
 I'll use that star to write, "I love you"
 A thousand times across the sky
 
 One thing isn't very clear, my love
 Teachers shouldn't stand so near, my love
 Graduation's almost here, my love
 You'd better teach me tonight
 
 I've played loves scenes in a flick or two
 And I've also met a chick or two
 But I still can learn a trick or two
 Hey, teach me tonight
 
 I who thought I knew the score of it
 Kind of think I should know much more of it
 Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it
 Hey, teach me tonight
 
 The midnight hours come slowly creeping
 When there's no one there but you
 There must be more to life than sleeping
 Single in a bed for two
 
 What I need most is post graduate
 What I feel is hard to articulate
 If you want me to matriculate
 You'd better teach me tonight
 
 What do you get for lessons?
 Teach me, come on and teach me
 Teach me tonight
 
 
 I work at the Palace ballroom, but gee that palace is cheap
 When I get back to my chilly hall room, I'm much too tired to sleep
 I'm one of those lady teachers, a beautiful hostess you know
 
 One that the palace features, at exactly a dime a throw.
 Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
 Gosh how they weigh me down.
 
 Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys, tough guys who tear my gown.
 Seven to midnight I hear drums, loudly the saxophone blows,
 Trumpets are tearing my ear-drums, customers crush my toes.
 Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
 But it's a queer romance
 
 All that you need is a ticket,
 Come on big boy, ten cents a dance.
 Fighters and sailers and bow-legged tailors
 Can pay for their tickets & rent me
 Butchers and barbers and rats from the harbor
 Are sweethearts my good luck has sent me
 Thought I've a chorus of elderly bows
 Stockings are porous with holes at the toes
 I'm here till closing time
 Dance and be merry it's only a dime
 Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
 But it's a queer romance
 
 All that you need is a ticket.
 Come on, come on big boy, ten cents a dance.
 
 The evening breeze
 Caressed the trees, tenderly
 The trembling trees
 Embraced the breeze, tenderly
 
 Then you and I
 Came wandering by
 And lost in a sigh
 Were we
 
 The shore was kissed
 By sea and mist, tenderly
 I can't forget
 How two hearts met
 Breathlessly
 
 Your arms opened wide
 And closed me inside
 You took my lips
 You took my love
 So tenderly
 
 The evening breeze
 Erased the trees, tenderly
 The trembling trees
 Embraced the breeze, tenderly
 
 Then you and I
 Came wandering by
 And lost in a sigh
 Were we
 
 The shore was kissed
 By the mist, tenderly
 I can't forget
 How two hearts met
 Tenderly
 
 Your arms opened wide
 And closed me inside
 You took my chops
 Way from bops
 Tenderly
 
 Tenderly
 Tenderly
 Oh oh
 Oh oh
 
 I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
 When an old friend I happened to see
 I introduced him to my loved one and while they were dancing
 My friend stole my sweetheart from me
 
 I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
 Only you know how much I have lost
 Yes, I lost my little darling the night they were playing
 That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
 
 I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz

 Yes, I lost my little darling the night they were playing

 Thanks for the memory
 Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet
 Our wondrous week in Martinique and Vegas and roulette
 How lucky I was
 
 And thanks for the memory
 Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki
 We had a pad in London, but we didn't stop for tea
 How cozy it was
 
 Now since our breakup, I wake up
 Alone on a gray morning-after
 I long for the sound of your laughter
 And then I see the laugh's on me
 
 But thanks for the memory
 Of every touch and thrill; I've been through the mill
 I've lived a lot and learned a lot; you loved me not and still
 I miss you so much
 
 Thanks for the memory
 Of how we used to jog even in a fog
 That barbecue in Malibu away from all the smog
 How rainy it was
 
 Thanks for the memory
 Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
 Tonight, the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
 How brainy he was
 
 Gone are those evenings on Broadway
 Together we'd go to a great show
 But now I begin with the Late Show
 And wish that you were watching too
 
 I know it's a fallacy
 That grown men never cry; baby, that's a lie
 We had our bed of roses, but forgot that roses die
 And thank you so much
 
 That certain feeling
 The first time I met you
 I hit the ceiling
 I could not forget you
 
 You were completely sweet
 Oh, what could I do?
 I wanted phrases
 to sing his praises
 
 That certain feeling
 The one that they all know
 No use concealing
 I`ve got what they call love
 
 Now we`re together
 Let`s find out whether
 You`re feeling, that feeling too
 
 I felt it happen
 Just as you came in view
 Grew sort of dizzy
 Thought gee, who is he?
 
 That certain feeling
 I`m here to confess it
 Is so appealing
 No words can express it
 
 I can not hide it
 I must confide it
 I`m feeling that feeling, too.
 
 That old black magic has me in its spell
 That old black magic that you weave so well
 Icy fingers up and down my spine
 The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine
 
 The same old tingle that I feel inside
 When that elevator starts its ride
 Down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
 Like a leaf that's caught in the tide
 
 I should stay away, but what can I do?
 I hear your name, and I'm aflame
 Aflame with such a burning desire
 That only your kiss can put out the fire
 
 You are the lover that I've waited for
 The mate that fate had me created for
 And every time your lips meet mine
 Baby, down and down I go
 All around I go, in a spin
 Loving the spin that I'm in
 Under that old black magic called love
 
 It's that old devil called love again
 Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shove again
 Putting rain in my eyes, tears in my dreams
 And rocks in my heart
 
 It's that sly old sun of a gun again
 He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
 But I still have that rain, still have those tears
 And those rocks in my heart
 
 Suppose I didn't stay, ran away, wouldn't play
 The devil, what a potion he would brew?
 He'd follow me around, build me up, tear me down
 Till I'd be so bewildered I wouldn't know what to do
 
 Might as well give up that fight again
 I know darn well he'll convince me that he's right again
 When he sings that sorry song, I'm just gonna tag along
 With that old devil called love
 
 He'd follow me around, build me up, tear me down
 Till I'd be so bewildered I wouldn't know what to do
 With that old devil called love
 With that old devil called love
 
 Last night I started out happy
 Last night my heart was so gay
 Last night I found myself dancing
 In my favorite cabaret
 You were completely forgotten
 Just an affair of the past
 Then suddenly something happened to me
 And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
 I saw you last night and got that old feeling
 When you came in sight I got that old feeling
 The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
 And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
 Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
 And I knew the spark of love was still burning
 There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
 For that old feeling, is still in my heart
 
 I saw you last night and got that old feeling

 And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
 Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
 And I knew the spark of love was still burning
 There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
 For that old feeling, is still in my heart
 
 To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
 And reminisce with you that's my desire.
 To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
 And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
 We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
 I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
 To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
 Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.
 
 You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
 You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
 Thin or fat, young or old;
 Shake their shoulders bold.
 You're bound to fall for the bugle call;
 You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
 Hold me baby; Let's syncopate to that blue melody;
 Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!
 While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.
 
 I tremble at your touch
 I know I shouldn't
 But that's the way it is
 
 I want you oh-so much
 I know I shouldn't
 But that's the way it is
 
 I can see so clearly
 That we are worlds apart
 But when you are near me
 I can't see beyond my heart
 
 I worship at your shrine
 You said I shouldn't
 But that's the way it is
 
 I begged you to be mine
 I said I wouldn't
 But that's the way it is
 
 I love you forever
 Though it may never be
 But that's the way it is
 With a guy like me
 
 I tremble at your touch
 I know I shouldn't
 But that's the way it is
 
 I want you oh-so much
 I know I shouldn't
 But that's the way it is
 
 I can see so clearly
 That we are worlds apart
 But, oh, when you are near me
 I can't see beyond my heart
 
 I worship at your shrine
 You said I shouldn't
 But that's the way it is
 
 I begged you to be mine
 I said I wouldn't
 But that's the way it is
 
 I'll love you forever
 Though it may never be
 But that's the way it is
 With people like you and me
 
 Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
 You came along and everything's startin' to hum
 Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
 Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
 You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
 Wait till the warm-up's underway
 Wait till our lips have met
 And wait till you see that sunshine day
 You ain't seen nothin' yet
 The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
 Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
 Come the day you're mine
 I'm gonna teach you to fly
 We've only tasted the wine
 We're gonna drain the cup dry
 Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
 You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
 Wait till you're locked in my embrace
 Wait till I draw you near
 Wait till you see that sunshine place
 Ain't nothin' like it here
 The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
 The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
 Come the day you're mine
 And you're gonna be mine
 
 We'll have a blue room
 A new room for two room
 Where every day's a holiday
 Because you're married to me.
 
 Not like a ballroom
 A small room, a hall room
 Where I can smoke my pipe away
 With your wee head upon my knee.
 
 We will thrive on, keep alive on
 Just nothing but kisses
 With mister and missus
 On little blue chairs.
 
 You sew your trousseau
 And Robinson Crusoe
 Is not so far from worldly cares
 As our blue room far away upstairs!
 
 Oh, how I love him
 But he just doesn't see
 
 Tall and tan and young and handsome
 The boy from Ipanema goes walking
 And when he passes
 Each girl he passes goes, ah
 
 When he walks
 He's like a samba
 That swings so cool and sways so gentle
 That when he passes each girl
 He passes goes, ah
 
 Oh, but I watch him so sadly
 How can I tell him I love him?
 Yes, I would give my heart gladly
 But each day
 When he walks to the sea
 He looks straight ahead, not at me
 
 Tall and tan and young and handsome
 The boy from Ipanema goes walking
 And when he passes goes, ah
 
 I smile, but he doesn't see 
 He just doesn't see; he never sees me
 
 
 I only meant to love you
 Don't you know it, babe?
 Why couldn't you be contented
 With the love I gave?
 I've given you my heart
 But now you want my mind
 Your love scares me to death, girl
 It's the chokin' kind
 You can kill a man
 With bullets, poison, or a knife
 But it hurts him more
 To take his pride and run his life
 Whatever it is you want, girl
 Lord, I hope you find
 But that hat don't fit my head
 It's the chokin' kind
 
 When you fall in love again, girl
 Take a tip from me
 If you don't like the peaches
 Walk on by the tree
 Find what you want and keep it
 Treat it sweet and kind
 But let it breathe
 Don't make your love the chokin' kind
 Oh baby, bye bye, baby, bye bye, baby bye bye, oh baby, bye bye
 Bye bye, baby, baby, bye bye
 
 Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
 Jack Frost nipping at your nose
 Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
 And folks dressed up like Eskimos
 
 Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
 Help to make the season bright
 Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
 Will find it hard to sleep tonight
 
 They know that Santa's on his way
 He's loaded lots of toys
 And goodies on his sleigh
 And every mother's child is gonna spy
 To see if reindeer really know how to fly
 
 And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
 To kids from one to ninety-two
 Although it's been said
 Many times, many ways
 Merry Christmas to you!

 There's a church in the valley by the Wildwood
 No lovelier spot in the dale
 No place is so dear to my childhood
 As the little brown church in the vale
 
 Come to the church by the Wildwood
 Oh, come to the church in the vale
 No spot is so dear to my childhood
 As the little brown church in the vale
 
 How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning
 To listen to the clear ringing bells
 Its tones so sweetly are calling
 Oh, come to the church in the vale
 
 Come to the church by the Wildwood
 Oh, come to the church in the vale
 No spot is so dear to my childhood
 As the little brown church in the vale
 
 There, close by the church in the valley
 Lies one that I loved so well
 She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, 'neath the willow
 Disturb not her rest in the vale
 
 Come to the church by the Wildwood
 Oh, come to the church in the vale
 No spot is so dear to my childhood
 As the little brown church in the vale
 
 There, close by the side of that loved one
 'Neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom
 When farewell hymns shall be chanted
 I shall rest by her side in the tomb
 
 Come to the church by the Wildwood
 Oh, come to the church in the vale
 No spot is so dear to my childhood
 As the little brown church in the vale
 
 Beautiful music
 Dangerous rhythm
 
 It's something daring, the Continental
 A way of dancing that's really ultra-new
 It's very subtle, the Continental
 Because it does what you want it to do
 
 It has a passion, the Continental
 An invitation to moonlight and romance
 It's quite the fashion, the Continental
 Because you tell of your love while you dance
 
 You kiss while you're dancing
 It's continental, oh, it's continental
 You sing while you're dancing
 Your voice is gentle and so sentimental
 
 You'll know before the dance is through
 That you're in love with her and she's in love with you
 You'll find while you're dancin'
 That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
 A certain rhythm that you can't control
 And you will do the Continental all the time
 
 You'll find while you're dancin'

 I'll be down to get you in a taxi honey
 Better be ready 'bout half past eight
 I mean don't be late
 Be there when the band starts playin'
 
 Remember when you get there honey
 Dance all over the floor, dance all over my shoes
 When the band plays the Jelly Roll blues
 Set 'em all alight at the darktown strutters ball
 
 I'll be down to get you in a push cart honey
 Better be ready 'bout half past eight
 I mean don't be late
 Be there when the band starts playin'
 
 'Member when you get there honey
 Shim sham wins them all, dance all over my shoes
 When the band plays the Jelly Roll's blues
 Set 'em all alight, the darktown strutters ball
 
 The Dipsy Doodle's the thing to beware
 The Dipsy Doodle will get in your hair
 And if it gets you, it couldn't be worse
 The things you say will come out in reverse
 Like "You love I and me love you"
 That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works
 
 The Dipsy Doodle's easy to find
 You know it's always in back of your mind
 You never know it until it's too late
 And then you're in such a terrible state
 Like "The moon jumped over the cow, hey diddle"
 That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works
 
 Whenever you think you're crazy
 You're just a victim of the Dipsy Doodle
 Ah, but it's not your mind that's hazy
 It's your tongue that's at fault, not your noodle
 
 You better listen and try to be good
 And try to do all the things that you should
 The Dipsy Doodle will get you some day
 You'll think you're crazy, the things that you'll say
 Like "Rhythm got I and hot am I"
 That's the way the Dipsy Doodle works
 
 If it gets you, you'll be singin' it
 And we'll bet you, you'll be swingin' it
 
 The Dipsy Doodle's the thing to beware
 The Dipsy Doodle will get in your hair
 And if it gets you, it couldn't be worse
 Everything you say will come out in reverse
 "You love I and me love you"
 That is just the way the Dipsy Doodle works
 
 Whenever you think you're crazy
 You're the victim of the Dipsy Doodle
 But it's not your mind that's hazy
 It's your tongue that's at fault, not your noodle
 
 You better listen and try to be good
 And try to do all the things that you should
 The Dipsy Doodle will get you some day
 And you'll think you're crazy, the things you'll say
 "Violets are red, roses are blue"
 Roses, roses, roses, all around you
 
 You'll never know it until too late
 And then you're in such a terrible state
 If you wanna do the Doodle, do the Dipsy Doodle
 Doo, doo, doo, do the Dipsy Doodle
 Doo, doo, doo, do the Dipsy Doodle
 Doo, doo, doo, do the Dipsy Doodle
 Do the Dipsy Doodle now
 
 Noel, noel, noel, noel
 Born is the King of Israel
 Noel, noel, noel, noel
 Born is the King of Israel
 
 They looked up and saw a star
 Shining in the east beyond them far
 
 Noel, noel, noel, noel
 Born is the King
 Born is the King
 Born is the King of Israel
 
 
 The gentleman is a dope, a man of many faults
 A clumsy Joe who wouldn't know a Rhumba from a Waltz
 The gentleman is a dope and not my cup of tea
 
 The gentleman isn't bright; he doesn't know the score
 A Cake will come; he'll take a crumb and never ask for more
 The gentleman's eyes are blue, but little do they see
 
 He's somebody else's problem; she's welcome to the guy
 She'll never understand him half as well as I
 The gentleman is a dope; he isn't very smart
 He's just a lug you like to hug and hold against your heart
 The gentleman is a dope; doesn't know how happy he could be
 Look at me crying my eyes out as if he belonged to me
 As if; he'll never belong to me
 
 Tall and tan and young and lovely
 The girl from Ipanema goes walking
 And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah
 
 When she walks, she's like a samba
 That swings so cool and sways so gentle
 That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah
 
  But he watch her so sadly
 How can he tell her he loves her
 Yes I would give my heart gladly
 But each day, that she walks to the sea
 She looks straight ahead, not at he
 
 Tall,  tan,  young,  lovely
 The girl from Ipanema goes walking
 And when she passes, he smile - but she doesn't see
 
 Oh, the good life, full of fun
 Seems to be the ideal
 Yes, the good life lets you hide 
 All the sadness you feel
 
 You won't really fall in love
 For you can't take the chance
 So be honest with yourself
 Don't try to fake romance
 
 It's the good life 
 To be free and explore the unknown
 Like the heartaches 
 When you learn you must face them alone
 
 Please, remember, I still love you
 And in case you don't know
 Well, just wake up
 Kiss the good life "hello"
 
 I've got the "you don't know the half of it, dearie" blues
 Oh, how I wish you'd drop that anger and end your cruise
 You're just a duffer who makes me suffer
 All the younger set says your heart's to let
 I've got the "you don't know the half of it, dearie" blues
 
 I've got the "you don't know the half of it, dearie" blues
 Although I know that love's a gamble, I hate to lose
 Life will be duller; we'll have no color
 Jill without a Jack makes the future black
 I've got the "you don't know the half of it, dearie" blues
 I've got the "you don't know the half of it, dearie" blues
 
 Everyday brings change, and the world puts on a new face
 Sudden things rearrange, and this whole world seems like a new place
 Oh yeah, secretly I been tailing you
 Like a fox that prays on a rabbit
 Had to get you and so I knew
 I had to learn your ways and habits
 Oh, you were the catch that I was after
 But I looked up and I was in your arms and I knew that I was captured
 
 What's this whole world comin' to
 Things just ain't the same
 Any time the hunter gets captured by the game
 
 I had to lay such a tender trap
 Hoping you might fall into it
 Love hit me like a sudden slap
 One kiss and then I knew it
 Oh, my plans didn't work out like I thought
 'Cause I had laid my trap for you but it seems like I got caught
 
 What's this whole world comin' to
 Things just ain't the same
 Any time the hunter gets captured by the game
 
 We're going through the impatient years
 The years when the day seems twice as long
 Restless and sighing and laughing and crying
 And dreaming a dream people say is wrong
 
 But we'll journey through the impatient years
 To each other's arms where we belong, clinging together
 I'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year
 But we'll journey through the impatient years
 
 To each other's arms where we belong, clinging together
 I'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year

 I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew, and never wished for Turkey
 As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
 Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad
 I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad
 But social circles spin too fast for me
 My "hobohemia" is the place to be
 
 I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
 I like the theater, but never come late
 I never bother, with people I hate
 That's why the lady is a tramp
 
 I don't like crap games, with barons and earls
 Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
 Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
 That's why the lady is a tramp
 
 I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
 Life without care
 I'm broke, it's OK
 Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
 That's why the lady is a tramp
 
 I go to Coney, the beach is divine
 I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
 I follow Winchell, and read every line
 That's why the lady is a tramp
 
 I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
 I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
 I go to Opera and stay wide awake
 That's why the lady is a tramp
 
 I like the green grass under my shoes
 What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
 I'm alone when I lower my lamp
 That's why the lady is a tramp
 
 Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
 Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
 While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh "I love you so" 
 Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
 Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low
 
 Dream beside me in the midnight glow, the lamp Is low
 Dream and watch the shadows came and go, the lamp Is low
 While you linger in my arms, my lips will sigh "I love you so" 
 Dream the sweetest dream will ever know
 Tonight the moon is high, the lamp Is low
 
 Someday he'll come along
 The man I love
 And he'll be big and strong
 The man I love
 And when he comes my way
 I'll do my best to make him stay
 
 He'll look at me and smile
 I'll understand
 And in a little while
 He'll take my hand
 And though it seems absurd
 I know we both won't say a word
 
 Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
 Maybe Monday, maybe not
 Still I'm sure to meet him one day
 Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
 
 He'll build a little home
 Just meant for two
 From which I'll never roam
 Who would, would you
 And so, all else above
 I'm waiting for the man I love
 
 He'll build a little home
 Just meant for two
 From which I'll never roam
 Who would, would you
 And so, all else above
 I'm waiting for the man I love
 
 The night is bitter,
 The stars have lost their glitter,
 The winds grow colder,
 And suddenly you`re older
 And all because of
 The man that got away.
 
 No more his eager call,
 The writing`s on the wall,
 The dreams you dreamed have all
 Gone astray.
 The man that won you
 Has run off and undone you.
 That great beginning
 Has seen it`s final inning,
 Don`t know what happened
 It`s all a crazy game.
 
 No more that all-time thrill
 For you`ve been through the mill,
 And never a new love will
 Be the same.
 
 Good riddance, good-bye.
 Every trick of his you`re on to -
 But fools will be fools and where`s he gone to?
 
 The road gets rougher,
 It`s lonelier and tougher.
 With hope you burn up,
 Tomorrow he may turn up.
 There`s just no letup
 The livelong night and day.
 
 Ever since this world began
 There is nothing sadder than
 A one-man woman
 Looking for the man that got away . . .

 The more I see you
 The more I want you
 Somehow this feeling
 Just grows and grows
 With every sigh I become
 More mad about you
 More lost without you
 And so it goes
 Can you imagine
 How much I love you?
 The more I see you
 As years go by
 I know the only one for me
 Can only be you
 My arms won't free you
 And my heart won't try
 
 Each time I look at you
 Is like the first time
 Each time you're near me
 The thrill is new
 And there is not a single thing I wouldn't do for
 The rare delight of the sight of you
 And there is not one single thing
 I wouldn't do for
 The rare delight of the sight of you
 And the more I see you
 The more I see you
 The more I see you
 The more I see you
 The more I see you
 The more I see you
 The more I see you
 The more I see you
 And the more I see you
 The more I see you
 The more I see you
 The more I see you
 The more I see you
 Everyday
 
 Oh, do you know the muffin man
 The muffin man, the muffin man
 Oh, do you know the muffin man
 That lives on Drury Lane?
 
 I blow through here
 The music goes 'round and around
 Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
 
 And it comes out here
 I push the first valve down
 The music goes down and around
 Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
 
 And it comes out here
 I push the middle valve down
 The music goes down around below
 Below, below, deedle-dee-ho-ho-ho
 
 Listen to the jazz come out
 I push the other valve down
 The music goes 'round and around
 Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
 And it comes out here
 
 It's not the pale moon that excites me
 That thrills and delights me, oh no
 It's just the nearness of you
 
 It isn't your sweet conversation
 That brings this sensation, oh no
 It's just the nearness of you
 
 When you're in my arms
 And I feel you so close to me
 All my wildest dreams come true
 
 I need no soft lights
 To enchant me
 If you'll only grant me
 The right to hold you ever so tight
 And to feel in the night the nearness of you
 
 It's not the pale moon that excites me
 That thrills and delights me, oh no
 It's just the nearness of you
 
 It isn't your sweet conversation
 That brings this sensation, oh no
 Yes, just the nearness of you
 
 When you're in my arms
 And I feel you so close to me
 All my wildest dreams come true
 
 I need no soft lights
 To enchant me
 If you'll only grant me
 The right to hold you ever so tight, yeah baby
 And to feel in the night the nearness of you
 
 When you're in my arms
 And I feel you so close to me
 All my wildest dreams come true
 
 I need no soft lights
 To enchant me
 If you'll only grant me
 The right to hold you ever so tight
 And to feel in the night the nearness of you
 
 On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
 The emblem of suffering and shame;
 And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
 For a world of lost sinners was slain.
 
 So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
 Till my trophies at last I lay down;
 I will cling to the old rugged cross,
 And exchange it some day for a crown.
 
 O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
 Has a wondrous attraction for me;
 For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
 To bear it to dark Calvary.
 
 So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
 Till my trophies at last I lay down;
 I will cling to the old rugged cross,
 And exchange it some day for a crown.
 
 In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
 A wondrous beauty I see,
 For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
 To pardon and sanctify me.
 
 So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
 Till my trophies at last I lay down;
 I will cling to the old rugged cross,
 And exchange it some day for a crown.
 
 To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
 Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
 Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
 Where His glory forever I'll share.
 
 So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
 Till my trophies at last I lay down;
 I will cling to the old rugged cross,
 And exchange it some day for a crown.
 
 When days are long and nights are lonely
 And all my daydreams have gone astray
 I think about the one and only
 Who's bound to find me some golden day
 
 The one I love is coming along some day
 And I'll have none except the one I love
 He/She may be near or ever so far away
 But I'll have none except the one I love
 
 And though our meeting is left to chance
 Until our meeting 
 I still will have my dream romance
 And through the night I pray to the moon above
 To please be kind and find the one I love
 
 Near Barcelona, the peasant crooned
 The old traditional Spanish tunes
 The Neapolitan street song sighs
 You think of Italian skies
 
 Each nation has a creative vein
 Originating a native strain
 With folk songs plaintive and others gay
 In their own peculiar way
 
 American folk songs, i feel
 Have a much stronger appeal
 
 The real American folksong is a rag
 A mental jag
 A rhythmic tonic for the chronic blues
 
 The critics called it a "joke song" but now
 They've changed their tune, and they like it, somehow
 
 For it's inoculated with a syncopated sort of meter, sweeter
 Than a classic strain, boy you can't remain, still or quiet, for it's a riot
 
 The real American folksong
 Is like a fountain of youth
 You taste, and it elates you, and then, invigorates you
 The real American folksong, the masses coaxed on, is a rag

 Look at the happy people
 Christmas is in the air
 Well, I know the secret of Christmas
 A secret I'm willing to share 
 
 It's not the glow you feel when snow appears
 It's not the Christmas card you've sent for years
 Not the joyful sound when sleigh bells ring 
 Or the merry songs children sing
 
 Yeah, the little gift you send on Christmas day
 Will not bring back the friend you turned away
 So may I suggest the secret of Christmas 
 It's not the things you do at Christmas time
 But the Christmas things you do all year through?
 
 La la, la la la, la la la, la la la la 
 So may I suggest the secret of Christmas 
 It's not the things you do at Christmas time
 But the Christmas things you do all year?
 Look at the happy people 
 Christmas is in the air 
 Well, I know the secret of Christmas 
 A secret I'm willing to share
 The secret of Christmas
 
 The shadow of your smile
 When you have gone
 Will color all my dreams
 And light the dawn
 
 Look into my eyes my love and see
 All the lovely things you are to me
 
 Our wistful little star
 It was far, too high
 A teardrop kissed your lips
 And so did I
 
 Now when I remember spring
 All the joys that love can bring
 I will be remembering
 The shadow of your smile
 
 My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
 A moment of bliss we spent
 Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
 As into the night we went
 And sang to our hearts? content
 
 The song is ended
 But the melody lingers on
 You and the song are gone
 But the melody lingers on
 
 The night was splendid
 And the melody seemed to say
 "summer will pass away
 Take your happiness while you may"
 
 There ?neath the light of the moon
 We sang a love song that ended too soon
 
 The moon descended
 And I found with the break of dawn
 You and the song had gone
 But the melody lingers on
 
 Love here in the starlit hour
 Oh, heaven is in your eyes
 While the wind is sobbing
 Underneath the stars
 Both our hearts are throbbing
 Like two guitars
 
 Love here in the starlit hour
 Night whispering lullabies
 Let me dream forever
 Underneath the silvery skies
 
 Will it be just as sweet again
 The glamor, the glory that we know?
 Will I find when we meet again
 The glamor, the glory'??s still aglow?
 
 But tonight let us forget tomorrow
 Here under the midnight blue
 Love will bloom and flower
 In the starlit hour with you
 
 The sun forgot to shine this morning
 'Cause everything went wrong last night
 I thought your arms would hold me the way they always do
 Instead your kisses told me that our affair was through
 
 Are memories we've shared forgotten?
 Has every dream just faded out of sight?
 The sun forgot to shine this morning
 'Cause everything went wrong last night
 
 The sun forgot to shine this morning
 'Cause everything went wrong last night
 I thought your arms would hold me the way they always do
 Instead your kisses told me that our affair was through
 
 Are memories we've shared forgotten?
 Has every dream just faded out of sight?
 The sun forgot to shine this morning
 This love of ours has ended
 The curtain has descended
 'Cause everything went wrong last night
 
 Chicks and geese and ducks better scurry
 When I take you out in the surrey
 When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top
 
 Watch the fringe and see how it flutters
 I will ride those high-steppin' strutters
 Nosy pokes will peek through their shutters
 And their eyes will pop
 
 The wheels are yeller the upholstery brown
 The dash board's genuine leather
 With in-sin glass curtains you can roll right down
 In case there's a change in the weather
 
 Two bright side lights winkin' and blinkin'
 Ain't no fingering what I'm thinkin'
 You'd be fingering if you're thinkin' that I'd care to swap
 For the shiny little surrey with the fringe on top
 
 The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear
 Are still inside my head
 The kindest words I'll ever know
 Are waiting to be said
 The most entrancing sight of all
 Is yet for me to see
 And the dearest love in all the world
 Is waiting somewhere for me
 Is waiting somewhere, somewhere for me
 
 The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear
 Are still inside my head
 The kindest words I'll ever know
 Are waiting to be said
 
 The most entrancing sight of all
 Is yet for me to see
 And the dearest love in all the world
 Is waiting somewhere for me
 Is waiting somewhere, somewhere for me
 
 The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear
 
 The sweetest sounds I'll ever hear
 Are still inside my head
 
 The kindest words I'll ever hear
 
 The kindest words I'll ever hear
 Are waiting to be said
 
 The most entrancing sight of all
 Is yet for me to see
 
 The most entrancing sight of all
 Is yet for me to see
 
 And the dearest love in all the world
 
 Is waiting somewhere for me
 
 Waiting somewhere
 
 Is waiting somewhere
 
 Along the mountain pass 
 There is a patch of grass 
 Where the swingin' shepherd plays a tune 
 His sheep never stray 
 Dancin' all day 
 Until they see the palin' yellow moon 
 And then he leads his flock 
 And homeward they all rock 
 To the tune of the swingin' shepherd blues 
 
 This I-is something really extra special 
 A ditty we like to do just for you 
 It's the onliest swinginest grooviest thingy that we've ever done 
 And if you like it then before we are through
 
 Then you ought to move along groove and join this song and I don't have to repeat 
 It's swing! 
 Ah yes!
 Now it's complete. 
 Whoa!
 
 The thrill is gone
 The thrill is gone away
 The thrill is gone, baby
 The thrill is gone away
 You know you done me wrong, baby
 And you'll be sorry someday
 
 The thrill is gone
 It's gone away from me
 The thrill is gone, baby
 The thrill is gone away from me
 Although, I'll still live on
 But so lonely I'll be
 
 The thrill is gone
 It's gone away for good
 The thrill is gone, baby
 It's gone away for good
 Someday I know I'll be open-armed, baby
 Just like I know a good man should
 
 You know I'm free, free now, baby
 I'm free from your spell
 Oh, I'm free, free, free now
 I'm free from your spell
 And now that it's all over
 All I can do is wish you well
 
 The very thought of you and I forget to do
 The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
 I'm living in a kind of daydream
 I'm happy as a king
 And foolish though it may seem
 To me that's everything
 
 The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
 You'll never know how slow the moments go till Im near to you
 I see your face in every flower
 Your eyes in stars above
 Its just the thought of you
 The very thought of you, my love
 
 The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
 You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
 I see your face in every flower
 Your eyes in stars above
 Its just the thought of you
 The very thought of you, my love
 
 Some day, when I'm awfully low,
 When the world is cold,
 I will feel a glow just thinking of you
 And the way you look tonight.
 
 Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
 And your cheeks so soft,
 There is nothing for me but to love you,
 And the way you look tonight.
 
 With each word your tenderness grows,
 Tearing my fear apart
 And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
 It touches my foolish heart.
 
 Lovely, never, ever change.
 Keep that breathless charm.
 Won't you please arrange it?
 Cause I love you 
 Just the way you look tonight.
 
 Mm, mm, mm, mm,
 Just the way you look tonight
 
 Since Jackson went over to Switzerland
 The Alps haven't been the same
 Since he started practicing yodelin'
 He's on the road to fame
 And back in the states, he'd really rate
 As big as anyone could
 And the headlines say
 In all the papers they say
 Yodel boy makes good
 
 He sings his yodelin' jive
 He sings his yodelin' jive all day
 The mountains echo his jive
 The mountains echo his jive all day
 
 Sometimes he yodels so sweetly
 To imitate the Swiss
 But the echo comes back like this
 The hills are always alive with yodelin' jive
 The mountains echo his yodelin' jive
 
 He sings yodelin' jive, yodelin' jive
 He sings his yodelin' jive all day
 The mountains echo my jive, my yodelin' jive
 The mountains echo my jive all day
 
 Sometimes he yodels so, so sweetly
 To imitate the Swiss
 But the echo comes back like this
 He sings his yodelin' jive, jive, jive all day
 The mountains echo his yodelin' jive
 
 Since Jackson went over to Switzerland
 He sings it all day to keep the blues far away
 He sings and he sings and he sings it all day
 He sings the jive all day
 
 I was just minding my business
 Life was a beautiful song
 Didn't have a care nor worry
 Then you had to come along
 I fell in love with you first time
 I looked into them there eyes
 You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
 With them there eyes
 They make me feel happy, they make me blue
 No stallin'
 I'm fallin'
 Going in a big way for sweet little you
 My heart is jumpin'
 You sure started somethin'
 With them there eyes
 You'd better watch them if you're wise
 They sparkle, they bubble
 They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
 You're overworkin' 'em
 There's danger lurkin' in
 Them there eyes
 Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'
 Maybe you think I'm all lies
 Just because I get romantic when I gaze in
 Them there eyes
 I fell in love with you first time
 I looked into them there eyes
 You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
 With them there eyes
 They make me feel happy, they make me blue
 No stallin'
 I'm fallin'
 Going in a big way for sweet little you
 My heart is jumpin'
 You sure started somethin'
 With them there eyes
 You'd better watch them if you're wise
 They sparkle
 They bubble
 They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
 You're overworkin' 'em
 There's danger lurkin' in
 Them there eyes
 
 You look at me and wonder
 You look at me and doubt
 Darling, your eyes are asking
 "Will the flame burn out?"
 
 No one is sure of sunshine
 No one is sure of dawn
 But I am sure
 My love will live on and on
 
 I'll be tired of you
 When stars are tired of gleaming
 When I am tired of dreaming
 Then I'll be tired of you
 
 This I know is true
 When winds are tired of blowing
 When grass is tired of growing
 Then I'll be tired of you
 
 Beyond the years till day is night
 Till wrong is right, till birds refuse to sing
 Beyond the years the echo of my only love
 Will still be whispering, whispering
 
 If my throbbing heart
 Should ever start repeating
 That it is tired of beating
 Then I'll be tired of you
 
 If you've never had to count a million sheep
 Then you've never been blue, never been blue
 If you've never had to cry yourself to sleep
 Then you've never been blue, never been blue
 
 I know I could go on laughing and troubled
 Plain trouble
 But when it concerns the heart
 The pain seems doubled
 
 Never worry about a little hurt or two
 There's nothing at all bothering you
 If you've never had a pal who stole your gal
 Then you've never known you've never been blue
 
 Something that this life will mind is plain, honey
 That's funny
 When you're miles away from home
 It's not so sunny
 
 No one ever knows what I go through
 While someone at home is babying you
 If you've never had to miss a goodnight kiss
 Then you've never known you've never been blue
 
 That's the thing, ain' it? An' membuh there's.
 Where that come from. Listen: There's a boat dat's
 Leavin' soon for New York. Come wid me, dat's where
 We belong, sister.
 
 You an' me kin live dat high life in New York.
 Come wid me, dere you can't go wrong, sister.
 I'll buy you de swellest mansion
 Up on upper Fi'th Avenue
 
 An' through Harlem we'll go struttin',
 We'll go astruttin',
 An' dere'll be nuttin'
 Too good for you.
 
 I'll dress you in silks and satins
 In de latest Paris styles.
 And de blues you'll be forgettin',
 You'll be forgettin',
 
 There'll be no frettin'
 Jes nothin' but smiles.
 Come along wid me, Hey dat's de place,
 Don't be a fool, come along, come along.
 
 There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York
 Come wid me, dat's where we belong, sister,
 Dat's where we belong! Come on, Bess!
 
 You low, crawlin' hound! Get away from my door, I tells
 You, leave it, you rattlesnake. Dat's what you is,
 A rattlesnake!
 
 Oh, there's a lull in my life 
 It's just a void and empty space 
 When you are not in my embrace
 Oh, there's a lull In my life 
 The moment that you go away 
 There is no night, there is no day
 The clock stops ticking
 The world stops turning
 Everything stops but the flame in my heart 
 That keeps burning, burning
 Oh, oh, oh
 There's a lull In my life 
 No matter how I may pretend
 I know that you alone can end
 
 I'd like to get away, Junior
 Somewhere alone with you
 It could be oh, so gay, Junior
 You need a laugh or two
 A certain place I know, Frankie
 Where funny people can have fun
 That's where the two will go, darling
 Before you can count up
 One, two, three, four
 
 There's a small hotel
 With a wishing well
 I wish that we were there together
 There's a  bridal suite
 One room bright and neat
 Complete for us to share together
 Looking through the window
 You can see a distant steeple
 Not a sign of people who wants people?
 When the steeple bell says
 "Good night, sleep well"
 We'll thank the small hotel together
 
 Pretty window curtains made of chance
 In a make-believe land
 On the wall are several cheerful prints
 Of Grant and Grover Cleveland
 Look out into the parlor and feast your eyes
 On the moose head on the wall
 Perhaps you'd like to play the organ
 They tune it every other fall
 When the steeple bell says
 "Good night, sleep well"
 We'll thank the small hotel 
 We'll creep into our little shell
 And we will thank the small hotel together
 
 I feel the autumn breeze; it steals cross my pillow
 As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp and in its song
 There is sadness because there's no you
 
 The lonely autumn trees, how softly they're sighing
 'Cause summer is dying; they know that in my heart
 There's no gladness because there's no you
 
 The park that we walked in, the garden we talked in
 How lonesome they seem in the fall
 The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
 Our favorite nook in the wall
 
 In spring we'll meet again; we'll kiss and recapture 
 The summertime rapture we knew and from that day
 Never more will I say, "There's no you"
 
 The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
 Our favorite nook in the wall
 
 In spring we'll meet again; we'll kiss and recapture 
 The summertime rapture we knew and from that day
 Never more will I say, "There's no you"
 
 Oh! Will you never let me be?
 Oh! Will you never set me free?
 The ties that bound us
 Are still around us
 There's no escape that I can see
 And still those little things remain
 That bring me happiness or pain
 
 A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
 An airline ticket to romantic places
 And still my heart has wings
 These foolish things remind me of you
 A tinkling piano in the next apartment
 Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
 A fair ground's painted swings
 These foolish things remind me of you
 You came you saw you conquer'd me
 When you did that to me
 I knew somehow this had to be
 The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
 A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
 Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
 These foolish things remind me of you
 
 First daffodils and long excited cables
 And candle lights on little corner tables
 And still my heart has wings
 These foolish things remind me of you
 The park at evening when the bell has sounded
 The "Ile de France" with all the gulls around it
 The beauty that is Spring's
 These foolish things remind me of you
 How strange how sweet to find you still
 These things are dear to me
 They seem to bring you near to me
 The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
 Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
 Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
 These foolish things remind me of you
 
 Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
 Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
 And still my heart has wings
 These foolish things remind me of you
 The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
 The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
 The song that Crosby sings
 These foolish things remind me of you
 How strange how sweet to find you still
 These things are dear to me
 They seem to bring you near to me
 The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
 Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
 Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
 These foolish things remind me of you
 
 The odds were a hundred to one against me
 The world thought the heights were too high to climb
 But people from Missouri never incensed me
 Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
 Far from history I had learned
 How many, many times the worm had turned
 
 They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
 When he said, the world was round
 They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
 They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
 When they said that man could fly
 
 They told Marconi
 Wireless was a phony
 It's the same old cry
 
 They laughed at me wantin' you
 Said, I was reaching for the moon
 But oh, you came through
 Now they'll have to change their tune, yes
 
 They all said we never could be happy
 They laughed at us and how
 But ho, ho, ho
 Who's got the last laugh now
 
 They all laughed at Rockefeller Center
 Now they're fighting to get in
 They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
 They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
 Hershey and his chocolate bar
 
 Ford and his Lizzie
 Kept the laughers busy
 That's how people are
 
 They laughed at me wanting you
 Said, it would be, hello, goodbye
 But oh, you came through
 Now they're eating humble pie
 
 They all said we'd never get together
 Darling, let's take a bow
 For ho, ho, ho
 Who's got the last laugh now
 
 They laughed at me wanting you
 Said, it would be, hello, goodbye
 But oh, you came through
 Now they're eating humble pie
 
 They all said we'd never get together
 Darling, let's take a bow
 For ho, ho, ho
 Who's got the last laugh
 
 Hee, hee, hee
 Let's at the past laugh
 Ha, ha, ha
 Who's got the last laugh now
 
 Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note
 Though by tomorrow you're gone
 The song has ended but as the songwriter wrote
 The melody lingers on
 
 They may take you from me
 I'll miss your fond caress
 But though they take you from me
 I'll still possess
 
 The way you wear your hat
 The way you sip your tea
 The memory of all that
 No, no, they can't take that away from me
 The way your smile just beams
 The way you sing off key
 The way you haunt my dreams
 No, no, they can't take that away from me
 
 We may never never meet again
 on that bumpy road to love
 Still I'll always, always keep the memory of
 
 The way you hold your knife
 The way we danced till three
 The way you changed my life
 No, no, they can't take that away from me
 No, they can't take that away
 No, they can't take that away
 No, they can't take that away from me
 
 If I should suddenly start to sing
 Or stand on my head or anything
 Don`t think that I've lost my senses
 It`s just that my happiness finally commences
 
 The long long ages of dull despair
 Are turning into thin air
 And it seems that suddenly I've
 Become the happiest girl alive
 
 Things are looking up
 I've been looking the landscape over
 And it`s covered with four leaf clover
 Oh things are looking up
 Since love looked up at me
 
 Bitter was my cup
 But no more will I be the mourner
 For I've certainly turned the corner
 Oh things are looking up
 Since love looked up at me
 
 See the sunbeams
 Every one beams
 Just because of you
 Love`s in session
 And my depression
 Is unmistakably through
 
 Things are looking up
 It`s a great little world we live in
 Oh I`m happy as a pup
 Since love looked up at me
 
 See the sunbeams
 Every one beams
 Just because of you
 Love`s in session
 And my depression
 Is unmistakably through
 
 Things are looking up
 It`s a great little world we live in
 Oh I`m happy as a pup
 Since love looked up at me
 
 This can't be love
 Because I feel so well
 No sobs, no sorrows, no sighs
 
 This can't be love
 I get no dizzy spells
 My head is not in the skies
 
 My heart does not stand still
 Just hear it beat
 This is too sweet to be love
 
 This can't be love
 Because I feel so well
 But, still, I love to look in your eyes
 
 My heart does not stand still
 Just hear it beat
 This is too sweet to, to be love
 
 This can't be love
 Because I feel so well
 But, still, I love to look in your eyes
 But, still, I love to look in your eyes
 
 You're walkin' along the street, or you're at a party,
 Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig,
 You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
 That this could be the start of something big.
 
 You're lunching at twenty-one and watchin' your diet,
 Declining a Charlotte russe, accepting a fig,
 When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy,
 And this could be the start of something big.
 
 There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend,
 Who knows what's written in the magic book.
 But when a lover you discover at the gate my friend,
 Invite her in without a second look.
 
 You're up in an aeroplane or dining at sardi's,
 Or lying at Malibu alone on the sand,
 You suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
 That this could be the start of something grand.
 
 This could be the start of something very big,
 Why don't you play your part?
 Please give your heart to me, and see.
 This could be the start of something wonderful,
 Why don't you take a chance?
 Just try romance with me, and see.
 
 Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money,
 Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine,
 Then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is,
 And this must be the start of something,
 This could be the heart of something,
 This could be the start of something big.
 
 You see this girl
 This girl's in love with you
 Yes, I'm in love
 Who looks at you the way I do?
 When you smile, I can tell
 We know each other very well
 
 How can I show you I'm glad
 I got to know you 'cause
 I've heard some talk
 They say you think I'm fine
 This girl's in love
 And what I'd do to make you mine
 Tell me now, is it so?
 Don't let me be the last to know
 
 My hands are shakin'
 Don't let my heart keep breaking
 'Cause I need your love
 I want your love
 Say you're in love and you'll be my guy
 If not, I'll just die
 
 Tell me now, is it so?
 Don't let me be the last to know
 My hands are shakin'
 Don't let my heart keep breaking
 'Cause I need your love
 I want your love
 Say you're in love
 And you'll be my guy
 If not, I'll just die
 
 This love of mine goes on and on
 Though life is empty since you have gone
 You're always on my mind, though out of sight
 It's lonesome through the day
 But, oh, the night
 
 I cry my heart out; it's bound to break
 Since nothing matters, let it break
 I ask the sun and the moon
 The stars that shine
 What's to become of it, this love of mine?
 
 Yes, now I know that my love
 All my life I was keeping
 And was saving only for you
 
 Yes, this love I was saving for you
 My love I was keeping for you
 A love no one else had before
 You could never ask me for more
 It was your love that I found
 And after I give this to you
 There will be no more love around
 And after I give this to you
 There will be no more love
 
 Yes, there'll be no more love to be had
 The world will be certainly sad
 Without love it may even die
 And then you'll discover that I
 Was living just so you could see
 You have all the love in the world
 That I got for you and for me
 You have all the love in the world
 That I got for you and for me
 
 Yes, now I know that my love
 All my life I was keeping
 And was saving only for you
 
 Yes, this love I was saving for you
 My love I was keeping for you
 A love no one else had before
 You could never ask me for more
 It was all the love that I found
 And after I give this to you
 There will be no more love around
 And after I give this to you
 There will be no more love
 
 Yes, there'll be no more love to be had
 The world will be certainly sad
 Without love it may even die
 And then you'll discover that I
 Was living just so you could see
 You have all the love in the world
 That I got for you and me
 You have all the love in the world
 That I have got for you and for me
 You've got all the love in the world
 That I've got for you and for me
 Yes, now I know
 
 I never knew what I'd go through without you
 Or how much I need for you to believe in me
 But it won't have to be like before
 'Cause I don't have to lie anymore
 
 'Cause this time it's real
 The way that I feel about you
 Don't walk away 'cause I'm not the same without you
 I'm not just fooling around
 I promise I won't let you down
 This time it's real, this time it's real
 
 I finally know why you had to go away
 You needed time--something that I couldn't give
 But I'm not the same man I've been
 And you'll know when I hold you again
 
 I've only given you half of my heart
 But I'll give it all from now on
 
 Somewhere, someday
 We'll be close together, wait and see
 Oh by the way
 This time the dream's on me
 
 You take my hand
 And you look at me adoringly
 But as things stand
 This time the dream's on me
 
 It would be fun
 To be certain that I'm the one
 To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon
 
 To see you through
 Till you're everything you want to be
 It can't be true, but
 This time the dream's on me
 
 It would be fun
 To be certain that I'm the one
 To know that I, at least, supply the shoulder you cry upon
 
 To see you through
 Till you're everything you want to be
 It can't be true, but
 This time the dream's on me
 
 This year's crop of kisses
 Don't seem as sweet to me
 This year's crop just misses
 What kisses used to be
 This year's new romance
 Doesn't seem to have a chance
 Even helped by Mr. Moon above
 This year's crop of kisses is not for me
 For I'm still wearin' last year's love
 
 Thou swell, thou witty
 Thou sweet, thou grand
 Wouldst kiss me pretty
 Wouldst hold my hand
 
 Both thine eyes are cute too
 What they do to me?
 Hear me holler I choose
 A sweet Lollapalooza in thee
 
 I'd feel so rich
 In a hut for two
 Two rooms and kitchen
 I'm sure would do
 
 Give me just a plot of
 Not a lot of land
 And thou swell, thou witty
 Thou grand
 
 Thou swell, thou witty
 Thou sweet, thou grand
 Wouldst kiss me pretty
 Wouldst hold my hand
 
 Both thine eyes are cute too
 What they do to me?
 Hear me holler I choose
 A sweet Lollapalooza in thee
 
 I'd feel so rich
 In a hut for two
 Two rooms and kitchen
 I'm sure would do
 
 Give me just a plot of
 Not a lot of land
 And thou swell, thou witty
 Thou grand
 
 Three little words
 Oh, what I'd give for that wonderful phrase
 To hear those three little words
 That's all I'd live for the rest of my days
 
 And what I feel in my heart they tell sincerely
 No other words can tell it half so clearly
 Three little words, eight little letters
 Which simply mean I love you
 
 Throw out the life line across the dark wave;
 There is a brother whom someone should save;
 Somebody's brother! O who then will dare
 To throw out the life line, his peril to share?
 
 Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line!
 Someone is drifting away;
 Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line!
 Someone is sinking today.
 
 Throw out the life line with hand quick and strong:
 Why do you tarry, why linger so long?
 See! he is sinking; oh, hasten today
 And out with the life boat! away, then away!
 
 Throw out the life line to danger fraught men,
 Sinking in anguish where you've never been;
 Winds of temptation and billows of woe
 Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow.
 
 Soon will the season of rescue be o'er,
 Soon will they drift to eternity's shore;
 Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay,
 But throw out the life line and save them today.
 
 This is the life line, oh, tempest tossed men;
 Baffled by waves of temptation and sin;
 Wild winds of passion, your strength cannot brave,
 But Jesus is mighty, and Jesus can save.
 
 Jesus is able! To you who are driv'n,
 Farther and farther from God and from Heav'n;
 Helpless and hopeless, o'erwhelmed by the wave;
 We throw out the life line, 'tis 'Jesus can save.'
 
 This is the life line, oh, grasp it today!
 See, you are recklessly drifting away;
 Voices in warning, shout over the wave,
 O grasp the strong life line, for Jesus can save.
 
 Time after time you'll hear me say
 That I'm so lucky to be loving you
 
 Time after time, I tell myself
 That I'm so lucky to be loving you
 So lucky to be the one you run to see
 In the evening when the day is through
 
 I only know what I know
 The passing years will show
 You've kept my love so young, so new
 
 And time after time you'll hear me say
 That I'm so lucky to be loving you
 
 I only know what I know
 The passing years will show
 You've kept my love so young, so new
 
 And time after time you'll hear me say
 That I'm so lucky to be loving you
 
 Time after time you'll hear me say
 That I'm so lucky to be loving you
 Just you, just you
 
 Time alone will tell 
 If our romance is real
 Or just a springtime spell
 For heaven knows and time will tell
 
 Though I know so well
 What we believe is love
 May just turn out to be
 A memory, but time will tell
 
 Do we really care
 Or do we share a fool's imagination?
 Nights will hurry by
 Then you will know, and so will I
 
 When Spring has had its fling
 If you are in my arms
 We'll know it's not a spell
 We'll know it's real, but time will tell
 
 When Spring has had its fling
 If you are in my arms
 We'll know it's not a spell
 We'll know it's real, but time, time alone will tell
 
 I've been married, and married, and often I've sighed
 "I'm never a bridesmaid, I'm always a bride"
 
 I never divorced them, I hadn't the heart
 Yet remember these sweet words, "'till death do us part"
 
 I married many men, a ton of them
 Because I was untrue to none of them
 Because I bumped off every one of them
 To keep my love alive
 
 Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me
 At night he was a horse's neck to me
 So I performed an appendectomy
 To keep my love alive
 
 Sir Thomas had insomnia, he couldn't sleep at night
 I bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right
 
 Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing
 I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing
 And now he plays where harps are just the thing
 To keep my love alive
 To keep my love alive
 
 I thought Sir George had possibilities
 But his flirtations made me ill at ease
 And when I'm ill at ease, I kill at ease
 To keep my love alive
 
 Sir Charles came from a sanatorium
 And yelled for drinks in my emporium
 I mixed one drink, he's in memorium
 To keep my love alive
 
 Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
 I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly
 
 Sir Atherton indulged in fratricide,
 He killed his dad and that was patricide
 One night I stabbed him by my mattress-side
 To keep my love alive
 To keep my love alive
 To keep my love alive
 
 Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart
 Don't upset your cart when she's so close
 Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
 Don't go off your beat; she's so close for comfort
 
 Too close, too close for comfort; please, not again
 Too close, too close to know just when to say when
 Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
 On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation
 
 One thing leads to another, too late to run for cover
 She's much too close for comfort now
 
 Too close, too close for comfort; please, not again
 Too close, too close to know just when to say when
 So be firm and be fair, be sure, beware
 On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation
 
 One thing leads to another, too late to run for cover
 She's much too close for comfort now
 Too close, much too close
 She's much too close for comfort now
 
 It's too darn hot
 It's too darn hot
 I'd like to sup with my baby tonight
 Refill the cup with my baby tonight
 I'd like to sup with my baby tonight
 Refill the cup with my baby tonight
 But I ain't up to my baby tonight
 'Cause it's too darn hot
 
 It's too darn hot
 It's too darn hot
 I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
 And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
 I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
 And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
 But brother, you fight my baby tonight
 'Cause it's too darn hot
 
 According to the Kinsey Report, ev'ry average man you know
 Much prefers his lovey-dovey to court
 When the temperature is low
 But when the thermometer goes 'way up
 And the weather is sizzling hot
 Mister, pants for romance is not
 
 'Cause it's too, too, too darn hot
 It's too darn hot
 It's too, too darn hot
 
 I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
 And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
 I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
 And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
 But brother, you fight my baby tonight
 'Cause it's too darn hot
 
 According to the Kinsey Report, ev'ry average man you know
 Much prefers his lovey-dovey to court
 When the temperature is low
 But when the thermometer goes 'way up
 And the weather is sizzling hot
 Mr. Gob for his squab
 A marine for his queen
 A G.I. for his cutie-pie is not
 
 'Cause it's too, too, too darn hot
 It's too darn hot
 It's too darn hot
 It's too darn hot
 It's too darn hot
 It's too darn hot
 
 You're just too marvelous
 Too marvelous for words
 Like glorious, glamorous
 And that old standby amorous
 
 It's all too wonderful
 I'll never find the words
 That say enough, tell enough
 I mean they just aren't swell enough
 
 You're much too much, and just too very very
 To ever be, in Webster's dictionary
 And so, I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
 To tell you that you're marvelous
 Too marvelous for words
 
 You're much too much, and just too very very
 To ever be, in Webster's dictionary
 And so, I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
 To tell you that you're marvelous
 Too marvelous for words
 
 All too soon
 We had to part
 The moment you had touched my heart
 And with you went my dream
 All too soon
 
 All too sweet
 Was our affair
 And you put all the sweetness there
 What a shame that it's gone
 All too soon
 
 I knew the strange delights
 That only you in love could bring
 And as I reached the heights
 The bottom fell from everything
 
 You should know as well as I
 Our love deserves another try
 For we whispered goodbye
 All too soon
 Too soon
 
 Such a bad thing to run away from my mother 
 Right into the arms of a lover
 I should walk away from you in my brand new shoes
 Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
 I'm a baby, and your kiss is so tender
 I'm a big fool if I ever surrender
 
 I'll come back some day when I learn the rules
 Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
 Soon enough the blues will come and break my heart 
 So I'll make my getaway before the teardrops start
 It's a hard game and I'm just a beginner
 Why play if the blues is the winner
 If I stick around I know I'll lose
 Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
 
 Soon enough the blues will come and break my heart 
 So I'll make my getaway before the teardrops start
 It's a hard game and I'm just a beginner
 Why play if the blues is the winner
 If I stick around I know I'll lose
 Because I'm just too young, too young for the blues
 Just too young, too young for the blues.
 
 I just got an invitation through the mails:
 "Your presence requested this evening, it`s formal
 A top hat, a white tie and tails"
 Nothing now could take the wind out of my sails
 Because I`m invited to step out this evening
 With top hat, white tie and tails
 
 I`m puttin` on my top hat
 Tyin` up my white tie
 Brushin` off my tails
 
 I`m dudein` up my shirt front
 Puttin` in the shirt studs
 Polishin` my nails
 
 I`m steppin` out, my dear
 To breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class
 And I trust that you`ll excuse my dust when I step on the gas
 
 For I`ll be there
 Puttin` down my top hat
 Mussin` up my white tie
 Dancin` in my tails
 
 I'm trav'lin' light
 Because my man has gone
 And from now on
 I'm trav'lin' light
 
 He said goodbye
 And took my heart away
 So from today
 I'm trav'lin' light
 
 No one to see
 I'm free as the breeze
 No one but me
 And my memories
 
 Some lucky night
 He may come back again
 But until then
 I'm trav'lin' light
 
 No one to see
 I'm free as the breeze
 No one but me
 And my memories
 
 Some lucky night
 He may come back again
 But until then
 I'm trav'lin' light
 
 I'm trav'lin' light
 I'm trav'lin' light
 I'm trav'lin' light
 
 When I was born, they found a silver spoon in my mouth
 And so I always had the best of care
 When winter came up north, of course they motored me south
 Where I was princess in our villa there
 
 Tutors and headwaiters fawned on me
 Life was just a bore till it dawned on me
 The cushy sheltered way of life was really no fun
 From now on, some manhandling must be done
 
 So treat me rough
 Muss my hair
 Don't you dare to handle me with care
 I'm no innocent child, baby
 Keep on treating me wild
 
 Treat me rough
 Pinch my cheek
 Kiss and hug and squeeze me
 'till I'm weak
 
 I've been pampered enough, baby
 Keep on treatin' me rough
 
 Treat me rough
 Pinch my cheek
 Kiss and hug and squeeze me
 'till I'm weak
 
 I've been pampered enough, baby
 Keep on treatin' me rough
 Keep on beatin' me
 Keep on treatin' me rough
 
 Sad is to live in solitude
 Far from your tranquil altitude
 Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream
 That never can be, will never be
 Dreamer awake, wake up and see
 
 Your beauty is an aeroplane
 So high my heart can't bear the strain
 A heart that stops when you pass by
 Only to cause me pain
 Sad is to live in solitude
 
 Sad is to live in solitude
 Far from your tranquil altitude
 Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream
 That never can be, will never be
 Dreamer awake, wake up and see
 
 Your beauty is an aeroplane
 So high my heart can't bear the strain
 A heart that stops when you pass by
 Only to cause me pain
 Sad is to live in solitude
 
 Trouble in mind, I'm blue
 But I won't be blue always,
 'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
 
 Now all you men's the same
 But now I'm old enough to change my name
 Lord, that sun's gonna shine in my back door someday
 
 I'm gonna lay my head
 On that lonesome railroad line
 And let the 2:19 ease my troubled mind
 
 Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
 But I won't be blue always
 Child, that wind's gonna come and blow my blues away!
 
 A woman gets all the blame
 For everything that happens under the sun
 But when it comes to being bad
 A woman's not the only one
 
 Trouble is a man
 A man who loves me no more, no more
 Trouble is a man
 A man I'll always adore
 
 Nothing good to say about him
 Still, I hate a day without him
 Why should he have to be
 The one, my only?
 
 Trouble is a man
 A man who's handsome and tall, so tall
 Trouble is a man
 Who's for himself and that's all
 
 After all we've done, he didn't mean it
 Now I understand--I should have seen it
 Trouble is a man
 Trouble is a man
 Trouble, trouble
 
 I'm tryin' to forget you, but try as I may
 You're still my every thought, Dear, every day
 No use tryin' to forget you 'cause I realize
 That I'm trying to forget you with tears in my eyes
 
 And those teardrops only remind me
 That I love you more and more
 So I'll put my foolish pride behind me
 And go knockin', knockin' at your door
 
 And I'll be tryin' to impress you
 Hopin' to possess you
 Now I know I haven't a chance, Dear, there's no denyin'
 But you can't blame a fellow for tryin'
 
 And those teardrops only remind me
 That I love you more and more
 So I'll put my foolish pride behind me
 And go knockin', knockin' at your door
 
 And I'll be tryin' to impress you
 Hopin' to possess you
 Now I know I haven't a chance, Dear, there's no denyin'
 But you can't blame a fellow for tryin'
 
 
 We come from the fire
 Living in the fire
 Go back to the fire
 Turn the world around

 Go back to the fire
 Turn the world around
 Go back to the fire
 Turn the world around
 
 We come from the water
 Living in the water
 
 We come from the mountain
 Living on the mountain
 
 Oh, oh, so is life
 Ah, ha, so is life
 Oh, oh, so is life
 Ah, ha, so is life
 
 Do you know who I am?
 Do I know who you are?
 See we one another clearly
 Do we know who we are?
 Oh, oh, so is life
 Abatiwaha, so is life
 Oh, oh, so is life
 Abatiwaha, so is life
 
 Water make the river
 River wash the mountain
 Fire make the sunlight
 Turn the world around
 
 Heart is of the river
 Body is the mountain
 Spirit is the sunlight
 Turn the world around
 
 We are of the spirit
 Truly of the spirit
 Only can the spirit
 Turn the world around
 We are of the spirit
 Truly of the spirit
 Only can the spirit
 Turn the world around
 
 Feelin' low 
 Rockin' slow 
 I want to go 
 Right back where I belong 
 Way down south in Birmingham 
 I mean south in Alabam'
 There's an old place where people go 
 To dance the night away 
 They all drive or walk for miles 
 To get jive that southern style 
 It's an old jive that makes you want 
 To dance till break of day 
 It's a junction where the town folks meet 
 At each function in a tux they greet you 
 Come on down, forget your care 
 Come on down, you'll find me there 
 So long, town, I'm heading for 
 Tuxedo Junction now

 Two little men in a flying saucer flew down to Earth one day
 Looked to left and right of it, couldn't stand the sight of it and said let's fly away
 They took a look at a Western movie, somebody heard them say
 If a horse can be a star, think how dumb the people are
 We'd better fly away
 Then they shook their little green antennas, scratched their purple hair
 Said this planet is an awful menace, let's go back to where we came from
 Two little men in a flying saucer just didn't care to stay
 Said it's too peculiar here, headed for the stratosphere and quickly flew away
 Now they took a left in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn when the Dodgers played a baseball game
 Heard all the screaming, said we must be dreaming 'cause this planet is insane
 During intermission, heard a politician making speeches as they traveled by
 But they departed faster than they started 'cause the holler blew them sky high
 Two little men in a flying saucer flew down to Earth one day
 Listened to a radio, saw a television show and said let's fly away
 They got their fill of commercial jingles and they were heard to say
 All the people seem to be living in a nursery we'd better fly away
 Traveled all around and once they'd seen us said let's head for space
 We were better off on Mars and Venus, goodness what a place to live in
 Two little men in a flying saucer just didn't care to stay
 Crossed a crowded thoroughfare, saw the hats the women wear and quickly flew away
 And quickly flew away
 
 Sweetheart, if you should stray a million miles away
 I'll always be in love with you
 Although you find more fish in someone else's dish
 I'll always be in love with you
 
 I can't do any more; I tried so hard to please
 But let me thank you for those tender memories
 
 I wish you happiness; as for me, sweetheart, I guess
 I'll always be in love with you
 
 First you say you will
 And then you won't
 And then you say you do
 And then you don't
 You're undecided now
 So what are you gonna do?
 
 First you want to play
 And then it's no
 And when you say you'll stay
 That's when you go
 You're undecided now
 So what are you gonna do?
 
 I've been sitting on a fence
 And it doesn't make much sense
 You keep me in suspense
 And you know it
 Then you promise to return
 When you don't
 I really burn
 I guess I'll never learn
 And I show it
 
 If you've got a heart
 And if you're kind
 Then don't keep us apart
 Make up your mind
 You're undecided now
 So what are you gonna do?
 
 I've been sitting on a fence
 And it doesn't make much sense
 You keep me in suspense
 And know it
 You promise to return

 If you've got a heart
 And if you're kind
 Then don't keep us apart
 Make up your mind
 You're undecided now
 So what are you gonna do?
 
 Under a blanket of blue
 Just you and I beneath the stars
 Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
 The night is ours
 
 Under a blanket of blue
 Let me be thrilled by all your charms
 Darling, I know my heart will dance
 Within your arms
 
 A summer night's magic, enthralling me so
 The night would be tragic
 If you weren't here to share it my dear
 Covered with heaven above
 
 Let's dream a dream of love for two
 Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
 Under a blanket of blue
 
 Under a blanket of blue
 Just you and I beneath the stars
 Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
 The night is ours
 
 Under a blanket of blue
 Let me be thrilled by all your charms
 Darling, I know my heart will dance
 Within your arms
 
 A summer night's magic, enthralling me so
 The night would be tragic
 If you weren't here to share it my dear
 Covered with heaven above
 
 Let's dream a dream of love for two
 Wrapped in the arms of sweet romance
 Under a blanket of blue
 Under a blanket of blue
 
 
 Don't you know I'd work for you, I'd slave for you
 Be a beggar or a knave for you?
 If that isn't love, it will have to do
 Until the real thing comes along 
 
 Gladly move the earth for you
 Prove my love, dear, and it's worth it for you
 If that isn't love, it'll have to do
 Until the real thing comes along 
 
 With all the words, dear, at my command
 I just can't make you understand
 I'll always love you, baby, come what may
 My heart is yours--what more can I say?
 
 I would cry for you, even sigh for you
 Tear those stars down from the sky for you
 If that isn't love, it'll have to do
 Until the real thing comes along 
 
 Walk on burning coals for you
 I would drive the Chrysler, leave the Rolls for you
 If that ain't love, it will have to do
 Until the real thing comes along 
 
 I would try to hit high C for you
 I'd even punch out Mr. T for you
 If that ain't love, it will have to do
 Until the real thing comes along 
 
 There's not a thing that you can't ask of me
 Go on, demand any task of me
 If you want the moon or a lavaliere
 All you got to do is nibble on my ear
 
 I would rob, steal, beg, borrow, and lie for you
 Lay my little body down and die for you
 
 If that ain't love, it will have to do
 Until the real thing comes along
 
 The night is a velvet cover
 My bed is a carpet of dew
 And I'm meeting my phantom lover
 In a dreamland rendezvous
 
 Vagabond dreams steal into my heart
 And speak to me of love once more
 Then take me far on a drifting star
 To some romantic shore
 
 Find me the one, that wonderful one
 Who'll whisper, "I am yours forever"
 
 Fill the night with music dipped in perfume
 Like "April in Paris" or maybe "Love in Bloom"
 For somehow I feel I'll find my ideal
 Tonight in my vagabond dreams
 
 Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
 And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
 But you and I have our love always there to remind us
 There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
 Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
 Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
 We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
 Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
 Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
 Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find
 Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
 No wonder my happy heart sings
 Your love has given me wings
 Your love has given me wings
 
 They call it wacky dust
 It's from a hot cornet
 It gives your feet a feeling so breezy
 And, oh, it's so easy to get
 
 They call it wacky dust
 It brings a dancing jag
 And once it starts, then only a
 Sap'll refuse to Big Apple or Shag
 
 Oh, I don't know just why
 It gets you so high
 Putting a buzz in you heart
 You'll do a marathon
 You'll wanna go on
 Kickin' the ceilin' apart
 
 They call it wacky dust
 It's something you can't trust
 And in the end the rhythm will stop
 When it does, then you'll drop
 From happy wacky dust
 
 Wait 'til you see him
 See how he looks
 Wait 'til you hear him laugh.
 
 Painters of paintings
 Writers of books
 Never could tell the half.
 
 Wait 'til you feel
 The warmth of his glance,
 Pensive and sweet and wise.
 
 All of it lovely
 All of it thrilling
 I`ll never be willing to free him.
 
 When you see him
 You won`t believe your eyes
 You won`t believe your eyes.
 
 
 Yeah, walk right in, sit right down; daddy, let your mind roll on
 Everybody, walk right in, sit right down; daddy, let your mind roll on
 Everybody's takin' 'bout a new way of walkin'
 Do you wanna lose your mind? Walk right in, sit right down
 Daddy, let your mind roll on
 
 Walk right in, sit right down; baby, let your hair hang down
 Walk right in, sit right down; baby, let your hair hang down
 Everybody's talkin' 'bout new way of walkin'
 Do you wanna lose your mind? Walk right in, sit right down
 Baby, let your hair hang down, yeah
 
 Yeah, walk right in, sit right down; daddy, let your mind roll on
 Everybody, walk right in, sit right down; daddy, let your mind roll on
 Everybody's takin' 'bout a new way of walkin'
 Do you wanna lose your mind? Walk right in, sit right down
 Daddy, let your mind roll on
 
 Walk right in, sit right down; baby, let your hair hang down, yeah, yeah
 Walk right in, sit right down; baby, let your hair hang down
 Everybody's talkin' 'bout new way of walkin'
 Do you wanna lose your mind? Walk right in, sit right down
 Baby, let your hair hang down; baby, let your mind roll on
 Baby, let your hair hang down; yeah, baby, let your mind roll on
 
 After the rain goes, people see rainbows
 But I see rainbows when it storms above
 So, darling, is it any wonder I can laugh at thunder
 Walking in the sunshine of your love?
 
 And below zero, I'm such a hero
 I never wear a muffler or a glove
 While all the world have frosty noses, I'm knee-deep in roses
 Walking in the sunshine of your love
 
 Just so you know, dear, I'm gonna tell you
 Your smile's my golden umbrella
 Even the rain-out, trouble, and pain out of my heart
 And from the very start your tender affection in my direction
 T'was like a lovely blessing from above
 That's why I go around just beaming, wondering if I'm dreaming
 Walking in the sunshine of your love

 I'm walking, walking in the sunshine of your love
 Yeah, baby, you keep me and warm
 
 Let someone start believing in you; let him hold out his hand
 Let him touch you and watch what happens
 Someone who can look in your eyes and see into your heart
 Let him find you and watch what happens
 
 Cold, no, I won't believe your heart is cold
 Maybe just afraid to be broken again
 Let someone with a deep love to give
 Give that deep love to you and what magic you'll see
 
 Let someone with a deep love to give
 Give that deep love to you and what magic you'll see
 Let someone give his heart, someone who cares like me

 Way down yonder in New Orleans
 In the land of the dreamy scenes
 There's a Garden of Eden
 You know what I mean
 
 Creole babies with flashin' eyes
 Softly whisper their tender sighs then stop
 Won't you give your lady fair a little smile?
 Stop, ya bet your life you'll linger there a little while
 
 We've got heaven right here on earth
 With those beautiful queens
 Way down yonder in New Orleans
 
 You're gonna find heaven right here on earth
 With all them beautiful queens
 Way down yonder in New Orleans
 I'm goin' down yonder to New Orleans
 It's way down yonder in New Orleans
 
 We can't go on this way,
 Laughing at love, day after day,
 I'm sincere, you're unfair,
 We can't go on this way.
 
 "It's all in fun" you say,
 After it's done, someone must pay,
 Then there'll be, so much misery, 
 We can't go on this way.
 
 Hiding behind a mask of laughters,
 It won't wipe away the curse,
 Even though it's fun we're after,
 I'll take you sweetheart, 
 For better or worse.
 
 If you would only say,
 "Yes it's OK, let's name the day,"
 Might as well, love will tell,
 We can't go on this way.

 We three, we're all alone, living in a memory
 My echo, my shadow, and me
 We three, we're not a crowd, we're not even company
 My echo, my shadow, and me
 What good is the moonlight, the silvery moonlight
 That shines above?
 I walk with my shadow, I talk with my echo
 But where is the one I love?
 We three, we'll wait for you, even till eternity
 My echo, my shadow, and me
 
 We three kings of Orient are,
 Bearing gifts we traverse afar,
 Field and fountain, moor and mountain,
 Following yonder star.
 
 O star of wonder, star of light,
 Star with royal beauty bright,
 Westward leading, still proceeding,
 Guide us to thy perfect light.
 
 Born a King on Bethlehem's plain
 Gold I bring to crown Him again,
 King forever, ceasing never,
 Over us all to reign.
 
 Frankincense to offer have I,
 Incense owns a Deity nigh,
 Prayer and praising, voices raising,
 Worshipping God on high.
 
 Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
 Breathes a life of gathering gloom,
 Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
 Sealed in the stone cold tomb.
 
 Glorious now behold Him arise,
 King and God and sacrifice,
 Alleluia, Alleluia,
 Sounds through the earth and skies.
 
 
 No tears, no fears
 Remember there's always tomorrow
 So what if we have to part
 We'll be together again
 
 Your kiss, your smile
 Are memories I'll treasure forever
 So try thinking with your heart
 We'll be together again
 
 Times when I know you'll be lonesome
 Times when I know you'll be sad
 Don't let temptation surround you
 Don't let the blues make you bad
 
 Some day, some way
 We both have a lifetime before us
 For parting is not goodbye
 We'll be together again
 
 Well, hello, Joe, what do you know?

 Do you sing and dance?

 We're gonna hop a jolly car ride down to Dixieland

 What a friend we have in Jesus
 All our sins and griefs to bear
 What a privilege to carry
 Everything to God in prayer
 
 O what peace we often forfeit
 O what needless pain we bear
 All because we do not carry
 Everything to God in prayer
 
 Are we weak and heavy laden
 Cumbered with a load of care?
 Precious Savior, still our refuge
 Take it to the Lord in prayer
 
 Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
 Take it to the Lord in prayer
 In his arms he'll take and shield thee
 Thou wilt find a solace there
 
 What a friend we have in Jesus
 All our sins and griefs to bear
 What a privilege to carry
 Everything to God in prayer

 Ooh, ooh, ooh
 What a little moonlight can do
 Ooh, ooh, ooh
 What a little moonlight can do to you
 You in love
 Your heart's fluttering all day long
 You only stutter cause you for sure
 Just throw that out of the way
 I love you
 Ooh, ooh, ooh
 What a little moonlight can do
 Wait a while
 Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through
 He'll get bored
 You can't resist him
 All you'll say
 When you have kissed him is
 Ooh, ooh, ooh
 
 What a little moonlight can do
 Ooh, ooh, ooh
 
 When the bells all ring and the horns all blow
 And the couples we know are fondly kissing
 Will I be with you or will I be among the missing?
 
 Maybe it's much too early in the game
 Ah, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
 What are you doing New Year's, New Year's eve?
 
 Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
 When it's exactly twelve o'clock that night
 Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve?
 
 Maybe I'm crazy to suppose
 I'd ever be the one you chose
 Out of the thousand invitations you received
 
 Ah, but in case I stand one little chance
 Here comes the jackpot question in advance
 What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
 
 Ah, but in case I stand one little chance
 Here comes the jackpot question in advance
 What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
 Oh, what are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
 
 What can I say dear after I say I'm sorry,
 What can I do to prove it to you that I'm sorry,
 I didn't mean to ever be mean to you-oo
 If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do,
 I was all wrong,
 But right or wrong I don't blame you
 Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
 I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry dear
 So what can I say dear after I say I'm sorry,
 
 Tell me Baby what can I say dear after I say I'm sorry so-so sorry
 What can I do to prove it to you I'm sorry
 Oh I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
 If I didn't care I wouldn't feel -oh I wouldn't feel like I do-do-do
 I was all wrong, but right or wrong I don't blame you no-no-no-no
 Why should I take somebody like you and shame you
 I know that I made you cry and I'm so sorry dear,
 Sorry I made you cry
 Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
 Sorry I made you cry
 
 What is there to say
 and what is there to do
 The dream I've been seeking
 has practically speaking come true
 
 What is there to say
 and how will I pull through
 I knew in a moment
 contentment and wholement, just you
 
 You are so lovable
 So livable
 Your beauty is just unforgivable
 You're made to marvel at
 and words to that effect
 
 So what is there to say
 and what is there to do
 My heart's in a deadlock
 I'd even face wedlock with you
 
 You are so lovable

 What is this thing called love?
 This funny thing called love?
 Just who can solve its mystery?
 Why should it make a fool of me?
 
 I saw you there one wonderful day
 You took my heart and threw it away
 That's why I ask the lord in heaven above
 What is this thing called love?
 
 I saw you there one wonderful day
 You took my heart and threw it away
 That's why I ask the lord in heaven above
 What is this thing called love?
 
 I'm trying to explain to friends, dear
 The reasons we two are apart
 I know what to tell our friends, dear
 But what can I tell my heart?
 
 It's easy to say to strangers
 That we played the game from the start
 It's easy to lie to strangers
 But what will I tell my heart?
 
 When I smile to hide all the tears inside
 What an ache it will be bring
 Then I'll wander home to a telephone
 That forgot how to ring, ring, ring
 
 I'm telling you'll soon be back, dear
 To fool the whole town may be smart
 I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
 But what will I tell my heart?
 
 I could say that you'll soon be back, dear
 To fool the whole town may be smart
 I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear
 But what will I tell my heart?
 
 Oh... What you want wid Bess?
 She's gettin' ole now;
 Take a fine young gal
 For to satisfy Crown.
 
 Look at this chest
 An' look at these arms you got.
 You know how it always been with me,
 These five years I been yo' woman,
 
 You could kick me in the street,
 Then when you wanted me back,
 You could whistle, an' there I was
 Back again, lickin' yo' hand.
 
 There's plenty better lookin' gal than Bess.
 Can' you see, I'm with Porgy,
 Now and forever
 I am his woman, he would die without me.
 
 Oh, Crown, won't you let me go to my man, to my man.
 He is a cripple an' needs my love, all my love.
 What you want wid Bess? Oh, let me go to my man. . .

 You ain't goin' nowhere!
 
 Take yo' hands off me, I say, yo' hands, yo' hands, yo hands.
 
 I knows you' ain' change - wid you and me it always be the same. 
 Git in dat thicket.
 
 Mother, mother
 There's too many of you crying
 Brother, brother, brother
 There's far too many of you dying
 You know we've got to find a way
 To bring some lovin' here today, yea
 
 Father, father
 We don't need to escalate
 You see, war is not the answer
 For only love can conquer hate
 You know we've got to find a way
 To bring some lovin' here today
 
 Picket lines and picket signs
 Don't punish me with brutality
 Talk to me, so you can see
 Oh, what's going on
 What's going on
 Ya, what's going on
 Ah, what's going on
 
 In the mean time
 Right on, baby
 Right on
 Right on
 
 Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong
 Oh, but who are they to judge us
 Simply because our hair is long
 Oh, you know we've got to find a way
 To bring some understanding here today
 Oh
 
 Picket lines and picket signs
 Don't punish me with brutality
 Talk to me
 So you can see
 What's going on
 Ya, what's going on
 Tell me what's going on
 I'll tell you what's going on - Uh
 Right on baby
 Right on baby
 
 What's new?
 How is the world treating you?
 You haven't changed a bit
 Handsome as ever I must admit
 
 What's new?
 How did that romance come through?
 We haven't met since then
 Gee, but it's nice to see you again
 
 What's new?
 Probably I'm boring you
 But seeing you is grand
 And you were sweet to offer your hand
 I understand
 
 Adieu
 Pardon my asking what's new
 Of course you couldn't know
 I haven't changed
 I still love you so
 
 Adieu
 Pardon my asking what's new
 Of course you couldn't know
 I haven't changed
 I still love you so
 
 What's your story, morning glory?
 What makes you look so blue?
 The way that you've been acting
 I don't know what to do
 For I love you, sure as one and one make two
 What's your story, morning glory?
 Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
 So, won't you let me know your point of view?
 
 What is your story, morning glory?
 You've got me worried too
 The postman came this morning
 And left a note for you
 Did you read it? Then you know that I love you
 What's your story, morning glory?
 Give your answer to this patient romancer
 Oh, won't you tell me that you love me too?
 
 Whatever Lola wants

 And little man, little Lola wants you 
 Make up your mind to have 
 no regrets 
 Recline yourself, resign yourself, you're through 
 
 I always get what I aim for 
 And your heart'n soul is what I came for

 Maybe he's not much, just another man
 Doing what he can
 But what does she care
 When a woman loves a man?
 
 She'll just string along
 All through thick and thin
 Till his ship comes in
 It's always that way
 
 When a woman love a man
 She'll be the first one to praise him
 When he's goin' strong
 The last one to blame him
 
 When everything's wrong
 It's such a one-sided game that they play
 But women are funny that way
 Tell her she's a fool
 
 She'll say, "yes, I know"
 But I love him so
 And that's how it goes
 When a woman loves a man
 
 Tell her she's a fool
 She'll say, "yes, I know"
 But I love him so
 And that's how if goes
 
 My fur coat's sold
 Oh Lord ain't it cold
 But I'm not gonna holler
 Cause I've still got a dollar
 And when I get low
 Oh, I get high
 
 My man walked out
 Now you know that ain't right
 He better watch out
 If I meet him tonight
 I said when I get low
 Oh, I get high
 
 All this hard luck in this town has found me
 Nobody knows but the troubles are all around me
 
 Oh, I'm all alone
 With no one to pet me
 My old rocking chair
 Ain't never gonna get me
 Cause when I get low
 Oh, I get high
 
 When I get low
 Oh, I get high
 
 Listen to the melody entrancing
 Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
 As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
 Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
 Sweet music soft and mellow
 Soothing and slow
 Strains of a mellow 'cello
 When lights are low 
 Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
 Why think about the weather 
 When lights are low 
 Two hearts revealing
 Music hath charms 
 Life's so appealing
 With inspiration, in your arms 
 Our lips meeting soft and tender 
 Love's all aglow 
 Why shouldn't we surrender 
 When lights are low
 
 Listen how happy hearts are beating
 Like the ocean beats upon the sand
 And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
 Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
 Sweet music soft and mellow
 Soothing and slow
 Strains of a mellow 'cello
 When lights are low 
 Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
 Why think about the weather 
 When lights are low
 Two hearts revealing
 Music hath charms
 Life's so appealing
 With inspiration, in your arms 
 Our lips meeting soft and tender 
 Love's all aglow 
 Why shouldn't we surrender 
 When lights are low
 
 When my sugar walks down the street
 All the little birdies go tweet, tweet, tweet.
 And in the evening when the sun goes down
 It's never dark when she's around
 
 She's so affectionate and I'll say this
 That when she kisses me I sure stay kissed
 When my sugar walks down the street
 The little birdies go tweet tweet tweet.
 
 Oh, when the saints go marching in
 Oh, when the saints go marching in
 Dear Lord, I want to be in that  number
 When the saints go marching in
 
 Oh, when the sun refuse to shine
 Oh, when the sun refuse to shine
 Dear Lord I want to be in that number
 When the sun refuse to shine
 
 Oh when they crown Him Lord of All
 Oh when they crown Him Lord of All
 Dear Lord, I want to be in that number
 When they crown Him Lord of All
 
 Oh, when they gather 'round the throne
 Oh, when they gather 'round the throne
 Dear Lord, I want to be in that number
 When they gather 'round the throne
 
 When the sun comes out
 And that rain stops beatin' on my window pane
 When the sun comes out
 There'll be bluebirds 'round my door, singin' like they did before
 
 That ol' storm broke out
 And my man
 Gal walked off and left me in the rain
 Though he's
 She's gone I doubt
 If he'll
 She'll stay away for good,I'd stop livin' if he/she should
 
 Love is funny, it's not always peaches, cream and honey
 Just when everything looked bright and sunny
 Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same
 
 Til that sun comes out
 And the rain stops beatin' on my window pane
 If my heart holds out
 Let it rain and let it pour, it may not be long before
 There's a knockin' at my door
 Then you'll know the one I love walked in
 When the sun comes out
 
 I saw a blind man,
 He was a kind man,
 Helping a fellow along,
 One could not see,
 One could not walk,
 But they both were humming this song;
 
 When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
 The whole world smiles with you,
 When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
 The sun comes shining through,
 But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
 So stop your sighing be happy again,
 Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
 The whole world smiles with you.
 
 I used to worry,
 I used to hurry,
 Each time it started to rain,
 Now I see light,
 Learned wrong from right,
 And you'll never hear me complain;
 
 When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
 The whole world smiles with you,
 When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
 The sun comes shining through,
 But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
 So stop your sighing be happy again,
 Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
 
 What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
 That comes with each new love affair
 The dreams that we cherish so often might perish
 And leaves you with castles in air
 
 When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies?
 When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
 At break of dawn there is no sunrise
 When your lover has gone
 
 What lonely hours the evening shadows bring
 What lonely hours with memories lingering
 Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
 When your lover has gone
 
 It seems we stood and talked like this, before
 We looked at each other in the same way then
 But I can't remember where or when
 
 The clothes you're wearing are the clothes, you wore
 The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
 But I can't remember where or when
 
 Some things that happened for the first time
 Seem to be happenin' again
 And so it seems that we have met before
 And laughed before, and loved before
 But who knows where or when
 
 Some things that happened for the first time
 Seem to be happenin' again
 And so it seems that we have met before
 And laughed before, and loved before
 But who knows where or when
 
 Transcribed by Todd Peach 
 When you're awake, the things you think
 Come from the dream you dream
 Thought has wings, and lots of things
 Are seldom what they seem
 Sometimes you think you've lived before
 All that you live to day
 Things you do come back to you
 As though they knew the way
 Oh the tricks your mind can play
 
 
 Let it rain and thunder,
 Let a million firms go under.
 I am not concerned with
 Stocks and bonds that I've been burned with!
 
 I love you and you love me
 And that's how it will always be
 And nothing else can ever mean a thing
 
 Who cares what the public chatters
 Love's the only thing that matters
 
 Who cares if the sky cares to fall in the sea
 Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
 Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?
 
 Why should I care?
 Life is one long jubilee,
 So long as I care for you
 And you care for me!
 
 Who cares how history rates me
 As long as your kiss intoxicates me?
 
 Why should I care?
 Life is one long jubilee,
 So long as I care for you
 And you care for me!
 
 Who walks in when I walk out?
 Who gives you that "hi baby"
 Who's it, who, got me jealous of you.
 Who walks in when I walk out?
 Now don't you know you're my baby,
 Who's it, who, got me worrying too? 
 Well, when we kiss, I kinda miss
 Something that used to be.
 Everyday, while I'm away, I get a feeling
 That you're fooling me. 
 
 Who walks in when I walk out?
 Who gives you that "hi baby"
 Who's it, who, got me jealous of you?
 
 Who's Sorry Now?
 Who's Sorry Now?
 Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
 Who's sad and blue?
 Who's crying too? 
 Just like I cried over you.
 Right to the end, 
 Just like a friend,
 I tried to warn you somehow.
 You had your way,
 Now you must pay;
 
 Why can't you behave?
 Oh, why can't you behave?
 After all the things you told me
 And the promises that you gave
 Oh, why can't you behave?
 
 Why can't you be good?
 And do just as you should?
 Won't you turn that new leaf over
 So your baby can be your slave?
 Oh, why can't you behave?
 
 There's a farm I know near my old home town
 Where we two can go and try settling down
 There, I'll care for you forever
 'Cause you're all in the world I crave
 But why can't you behave?
 
 There's a farm I know near my old home town
 Where we two can go and try settling down
 There, I'll care for you forever
 'Cause you're all in the world I crave
 But why can't you, oh why can't you
 Oh, why can't you behave?
 
 You had plenty money, Nineteen-Twenty-Two
 You let other women make a fool of you
 Why don't you do right like some other men do?
 Get out of here and get me some money too
 
 You're sittin' down wonderin' what it's all about
 You ain't got no money; they will put you out
 Why don't you do right like some other men do?
 Get out of here and get me some money too
 
 If you had prepared twenty years ago
 You wouldn't be wanderin' now from door to door
 Why don't you do right like some other men do?
 Get out of here and get me some money too
 
 I fell for your jivin' and I took you in
 Now all you got to offer me's a drink of gin
 Why don't you do right like some other men do?
 Get out of here and get me some money too
 Why don't you do right like some other men do
 Like some other men do?
 
 Spending these lonesome evenings
 With nothing to do
 But to live in dreams that I make up
 All by myself
 
 Dreaming that you're beside me
 I picture the prettiest stories
 Only to wake up
 All by myself
 
 What is the good of me by myself?
 
 Why was I born?
 Why am I living?
 What do I get?
 What am I giving?
 
 Why do I want a thing
 I daren't hope for?
 What can I hope for?
 I wish I knew
 
 Why do I try
 To draw you near me?
 Why do I do I cry?
 You never hear me
 
 I'm a poor fool
 But what can I do?
 Why was I born
 To love you?
 
 I'm a poor fool
 But what can I do?
 Why was I born
 To love you?
 
 
 Sleigh bells ring; are you listening?
 In the lane snow is glistening
 A beautiful sight; oh, we're happy tonight
 Walking in a winter wonderland
 
 Gone away is the bluebird
 Here to stay is a new bird
 He's singing a song as we go along
 Walking in a winter wonderland
 
 Well, in the meadow we can build a snowman
 And pretend that he is Parson Brown
 He'll say, are you married? We'll say no man
 But you can do the job when you're in town
 
 Later on we'll conspire
 As we dream by the fire
 To face unafraid of the plans that we made
 Walking in a winter wonderland
 
 In the meadow we can build a snowman
 And pretend he's a circus clown
 We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
 Until the other kiddies knock him down
 
 Oh, when it snows, ain't it filling
 Though your nose gets a chilling?
 We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
 Walking in a winter wonderland
 
 Those fingers in my hair
 That sly come-hither stare
 That strips my conscience bare
 It's witchcraft
 
 And I've got no defense for it
 The heat is too intense for it
 What good would common sense for it do?
 
 'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
 And although I know it's strictly taboo
 When you arouse the need in me
 My heart says, "yes, indeed" in me
 Proceed with what you're leading me to
 
 It's such an ancient pitch
 But one that I wouldn't switch
 'Cause there's no nicer witch than you
 
 'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
 And although I know it's strictly taboo
 When you arouse the need in me
 My heart says, "yes, indeed" in me
 Proceed with what you're leading me to
 
 It's such an ancient pitch
 But one that I'd never switch
 'Cause there's no nicer witch than you
 
 Though I know that we meet every night
 And we couldn't have change since the last time,
 To my joy and delight,
 It's a new kind of love at first sight.
 Though it's you and it's I all the time
 Every meeting's marvelous pastime.
 You're increasingly sweet,
 So whenever we happened to met
 I greet you 
 
 With a song in my heart
 I behold your adorable face.
 Just a song at the start
 But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
 When the music swells
 I'm touching you hand
 It tells that you're standing near, and 
 
 At the sound of your voice
 Heaven opens his portals to me.
 Can I help but rejoice
 That a song such as ours came to be?
 But I always knew
 I would live life through
 With a song in my heart for you.
 
 Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
 And these stars will not twinkle and fade out,
 And the words in my ears
 Will resound for the rest of my years.
 In the morning I find with delight
 Not a note of our music is played out.
 It will be just as sweet,
 And an air that I'll live to repeat:
 I greet you 
 
 With a song in my heart
 I behold your adorable face.
 Just a song at the start
 But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
 When the music swells
 I'm touching you hand
 It tells that you're standing near, and 
 
 At the sound of your voice
 Heaven opens his portals to me.
 Can I help but rejoice
 That a song such as ours came to be?
 But I always knew
 I would live life through
 With a song in my heart for you.
 
 Hey, little girl, comb your hair, fix your makeup
 Soon he will open the door
 Don't think because there's a ring on your finger
 You needn't try any more
 
 For wives should always be lovers too
 Run to his arms the moment that he comes home to you
 I'm warning you
 
 Day after day, there are girls at the office
 And the men will always be men
 Don't stand him up, with your hair still in curlers
 You may not see him again
 
 Wives should always be lovers too
 Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
 He's almost here; hey, little girl, better wear something pretty
 Something you wear to go to the city
 
 Dim all the lights, pour the wine
 Start the music, time to get ready for love
 Time to get ready for love; yes, it's time to get ready for love
 It's time to get ready; kick your shoes off, baby
 
 I saw you strolling by your solitary
 Am I nosy? Very, very
 I'd like to be a juicy huckleberry
 What you're after is a gal
 We're both in luck, for introductions
 Are not necessary
 
 Mmm, would you like to take walk?
 Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?
 Mmm, how about a sarsaparilla?
 Gee, the moon is yeller
 Sump'n good'll come from that
 
 Mmm, have you heard the latest song?
 Mmm, it's a very pretty strain
 Mmm, don't you feel a little thrilly?
 Gee, it's getting chilly
 Sump'n good'll come from that
 
 When you're strolling though the wheresies
 You need a whosies to lean upon
 But when you have no whosies
 To hug and whatsies, gosh, darn
 
 Mmm, would you like to take walk?
 Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?
 Mmm, ain't you tired of the talkies?
 I prefer the walkies
 Sump'n good'll come from that
 
 My little heart is full of palpitation
 What I need is consolation
 I'd like to stage a little celebration
 In the moonlight, right away
 I'll feel all pepped if you'll accept
 My friendly invitation
 
 Mmm, would you like to take walk?
 Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?
 Mmm, how about a sarsaparilla?
 Gee, the moon is yeller
 Sump'n good'll come from that
 
 Mmm, have you heard the latest song?
 Mmm, it's a very pretty strain
 Mmm, don't you feel a little thrilly?
 Gee, it's getting chilly
 Sump'n good'll come from that
 
 When you're strolling though the wheresies
 You need a whosies to lean upon
 But when you have no whosies
 To hug and whatsies, gosh, darn
 
 Mmm, would you like to take walk?
 Mmm, do you think it's gonna rain?
 Mmm, ain't you tired of the talkies?
 I prefer the walkies
 Sump'n good'll come from that
 
 Very far away in a foreign land 
 Lives the yellow woman and the yellow man 
 He's been around for many-a-year 
 They say they were there before we were here 
 Eatin' rice all day while the children play 
 You see, he believes in the family just like you and me
 
 Oh, yellow man, oh, yellow man 
 We understand, you know we understand 
 Ata, ata, ata, ta, ta, ta
 Ata, ata, ata, ta, ta, ta
 Ata, ata, ata, ta, ta, ta
 He keeps his money tight in his hand 
 With his yellow woman he's a yellow man 
 Got to have a yellow woman 
 When you're a yellow man
 
 Yesterdays, yesterdays
 Days I knew as happy sweet
 Sequestered days
 Olden days, golden days
 Days of mad romance and love
 
 Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
 Joyous free in flame and life
 Then sooth was mine
 Sad am I, glad am I
 For today I'm dreamin' of yesterdays
 
 Yesterdays, yesterdays
 Days I knew as happy sweet
 Sequestered days
 Olden days, golden days
 Days of mad romance and love
 
 For then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
 Joyous free in flame and life
 Then sooth was mine
 Sad am I, glad am I
 For today I'm dreamin' of yesterdays
 
 Yesterday
 
 
 Was it in Tahiti,were we on the Nile
 Long long ago say an hour ago
 I recall that I saw your smile
 I remember you-ooh
 You're the one who made my dreams come true
 A few kisses ago
 
 I remember you-ooh
 You're the one who said "I love you, too"
 Yes, I do, didn't ya know?
 
 I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
 Like the rain out of the blue
 
 When my life is through
 And the angels ask me to recall
 The thrill of it all
 Then I will tell them I remember you-ooh
 
 I remember, too, a distant bell and stars that fell
 Just like the rain out of the blue
 
 When my life is through
 And the angels ask me to recall
 The thrill of it all
 Then I will tell them I remember, tell them I remember
 Tell them I remember you
 
 You are the sunshine of my life
 That's why I'll always be around
 You are the apple of my eye
 Forever you'll stay in my heart 
 I feel like this is the beginning
 
 Though I've loved you for a million years
 And if I thought our love was ending
 I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 
 
 You are the sunshine of my life
 That's why I'll always stay around
 You are the apple of my eye
 Forever you'll stay in my heart 
 
 You must have known that I was lonely
 Because you came to my rescue
 And I know that this must be heaven
 How could so much love be inside of you? 
 
 You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
 That's why I'll always stay around
 You are the apple of my eye
 Forever you'll stay in my heart 
 
 Love has joined us
 Love has joined us
 Let's think sweet love
 
 If the nightingales could sing like you
 They'd sing much sweeter than they do
 For you brought a new kind of love to me
 
 And if the sandman brought me dreams of you
 I'd want to sleep my whole life through
 You brought a new love to me
 
 I know that I'm the slave, you're the queen
 Still, you can understand that underneath it all
 You're a man and I am only a maid
 
 I would work and slave the whole day through
 If I could hurry home to you
 You brought a new kind of love to me
 
 Though you say we're through 
 I'll always love you 
 And you can depend on me 
 Though someone that you've met 
 Has made you forget, honey, you know 
 You can count on me
 When I wish, I wish you success 
 
 And loads, loads of happiness, but, baby, 
 I gotta confess I'll be lonely if you ever
 Ah, if you ever need a friend 
 And you can depend on me 
 I'll be yours until the end 
 
 And loads of happiness 
 I wish you success 
 But, darling, I gotta confess I'm gonna be lonely 
 Oh, if you ever, ah, if you ever need a friend 
 I'll be right by your side, ah, till the end 
 And you can depend on me
 You can depend on me
 
 You can have him
 I don't want him
 He's not worth fighting for
 Besides there's plenty more where he came from
 I don't want him
 You can have him
 I'm giving him the sack
 And he can go right back where he came from
 I could never make him happy
 He'd be better off with you
 I'm afraid I never loved him
 All I ever wanted to do was
 
 Run my fingers through his curly locks
 Mend his underwear and darn his socks
 Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
 Wipe his glasses when he read the news
 Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
 Mornings after when he's had too much
 Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
 Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see
 I don't want him, you can have him
 You can have him, I don't want him
 For he's not the man for me
 
 You can have him
 I don't want him
 He's not worth fighting for
 Besides there's plenty more where he came from
 I don't want him
 You can have him
 He isn't my concern
 And he can just return where he came from
 I would look a trifle silly
 Taking him away from you
 That was never my intention
 All I ever wanted to do was
 
 Close the window while he soundly slept
 Raid the icebox where the food is kept
 Cook a breakfast that would please him most
 Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
 Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
 After breakfast clear the things away
 Bring the papers and when they've been read
 Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see
 I don't want him, you can have him
 You can have him, I don't want him
 For he's not the man for me
 
 You can't be mine
 And someone else's too
 Someday you'll find
 I've been a friend to you
 I don't believe that life's worth living
 I gave you all there was worth giving
 You never cared how I fared or what I do
 
 I called you mine, but I was not to blame
 For all the time you played up to
 Hand and game
 Second-hand love I can't see
 It's good for some, but not for me
 You can't be mine and someone else's too
 
 You couldn't be cuter
 Plus that
 You couldn't be smarter
 Plus that
 Intelligent face
 You have a disgrace
 Full charm
 For me
 
 You couldn't be keener
 You look so fresh from the cleaner
 You are the little grand slam
 I'll take to my fam-
 Ily
 
 My ma will show you an album of me that'll bore you to tears
 And you'll attract all the relatives we have dodged for years and years
 
 And what will they tell me?
 Exactly, what will they tell me
 Let's say you couldn't be nicer
 Couldn't be sweeter
 Couldn't be better
 Couldn't be smoother
 Couldn't be cuter, baby, than you are
 
 My ma will show you an album of me that'll bore you to tears
 And you'll attract all the relatives we have dodged for years and years
 
 And what will they tell me?
 I know just what they will tell me
 They'll say you couldn't be nicer
 Couldn't be sweeter
 Couldn't be better
 Couldn't be smoother
 Couldn't be cuter, baby, than you are
 
 You do something to me
 Something that simply mystifies me
 Tell me, why should it be
 You have the power to hypnotize me?
 
 Let me live 'neath your spell
 Do, do that voodoo that you do so well
 For you do something to me
 That nobody else could do
 
 Let me live 'neath your spell
 Do, do that voodoo that you do so well
 For you do something to me
 That nobody else could do
 
 That nobody else could do
 
 went to the racetrack my man he won 
 He gave his other woman money and didn't give me none 
 You don't know, you don't know my mind 
 You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin' 
 
 He said he didn't want me, I wasn't good enough 
 I'm gonna get myself another man and call his bluff 
 You don't know, you don't know my mind 
 You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin' 
 
 I'm not good lookin', I don't dress fine 
 But I'm the kind of mama that will take my time 
 You don't know, you don't know my mind 
 You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin' 
 
 You don't know, you don't know, you don't know my mind 
 You don't know, you don't know my mind 
 You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin' 
 
 Aw you don't know, you don't know, you don't know my mind 
 You don't know, you don't know my mind 
 You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'
 
 You don't know what love is
 Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
 Until you've loved a love you've had to lose
 You don't know what love is
 
 You don't know how lips hurt
 Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
 Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost
 You don't know what love is
 
 You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
 And I find you spinning 'round in my
 Brain
 Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
 You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
 
 And I find the very mention of you
 Like the kicker in a julep or two
 
 The thrill of the thought that
 You might give a thought to my plea
 Cast a spell over me
 Still I say to myself get a hold of
 Yourself
 Can't you see that it never can be
 
 You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature
 Rise
 Like a summer with a thousand Julies
 You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
 Though I'm certain
 That this heart of mine
 Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
 You go to my head
 You go to
 
 You are my destination
 I have to call
 'Cause you have so much on the ball
 Ah, you hit the spot
 Like the first embrace with a modest tide
 Well, you hit the spot
 Like pipe and slippers by the fireside
 Matter-of-factly don't know exactly what it is that you've got
 But you hit the spot
 You hit the spot
 Like a balmy breeze on a night in May
 You hit the spot
 Like a cool mint julep on a sunny day
 You hit the spot
 In my estimation
 
 
 You leave me breathless
 You heavenly thing
 You look so wonderful
 You're like a breath of spring
 You leave me speechless
 I'm just like the birds
 I'm filled with melody
 
 But at a loss for words
 That little grin of yours
 That funny chin of yours
 There's so much to my heart
 Or give your lips to me
 For darling that would be
 The final touch to my heart
 
 You leave me breathless
 That's all I can say
 I can't say more because
 You take my breath away
 
 You make me feel so young
 You make me feel like spring has sprung
 Every time I see you grin
 I'm such a happy individual
 
 The moment that you speak
 I want to go and play hide-and-seek
 I want to go and bounce the moon
 Just like a toy balloon
 
 You and I are just like a couple of tots
 Running across the meadow
 Picking up lots of forget-me-nots
 
 You make me feel so young
 You make me feel there are songs to be sung
 Bells to be rung
 And a wonderful fling to be flung
 
 And even when I'm old and gray
 I'm gonna feel the way I do today
 'Cause you make me feel so young
 
 You showed me the way
 When I was someone in distress
 A heart in search of happiness
 You showed me the way
 
 My sky was so gray
 I never knew I'd feel a thrill
 I couldn't dream a dream until
 You showed me the way
 
 The moment you found me
 The shadows around me
 Just disappeard from view
 The world became rosy
 Each corner so cozy
 Darling, all because of you
 You showed me the way
 And if I've learned that love can be a paradise
 For you and me
 Here's all I can say
 You showed me the way
 
 I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
 What's the use of trying not to fall?
 I have no will, you've made your kill
 'cause you took advantage of me!
 
 I'm just like an apple on a bough
 And you're gonna shake me down somehow
 So, what's the use,
 You've cooked my goose
 'cause you took advantage of me!
 
 I'm so hot and bothered that I don't
 Know my elbow from my ear
 I suffer something awful each time you go
 And much worse when you're near
 
 Here I am with all my bridges burned
 Just a babe in arms where
 You're concerned
 So lock the doors and call me yours
 'cause you took advantage of me.
 
 You turned the tables on me
 And now I'm falling for you;
 You turned the tables on me
 I can't believe that it's true
 I always thought when you brought
 The lovely present you bought
 Why hadn't you brought me more,
 But now if you'd come
 I'd welcome anything
 From the five and ten cent store,
 
 You used to call me the top
 You put me up on a throne
 You let me fall with a drop
 And now I'm out on my own.
 But after thinking it over and over,
 I got what was coming to me
 Just like the sting of a bee
 You turned the tables on me.
 
 Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart
 You're never satisfied until the teardrops start
 I tried to shower you with love and kisses
 But all I ever get from you is naggin' and braggin'
 My poor heart is saggin'
 
 The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame
 I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same
 You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart
 Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart
 
 No, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart
 You're never satisfied until the teardrops start
 I tried to shower you with love and kisses, baby
 All I ever get from you is naggin' and braggin'
 My poor heart is saggin'
 
 The way you toss my heart around's, is a cryin' shame
 I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same
 You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart
 Babe, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart
 
 The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame
 
 I'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same
 You only tearing all my little dreams apart
 Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart
 
 You'd be so nice to come home to
 You'd be so nice by the fire
 While the breeze on high sang a lullaby
 You'd be all my heart could desire
 
 Under stars chilled by the winter
 Under an August moon shining above
 You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
 To come home to and love
 
 Under stars chilled by the winter
 Under an August moon burning above
 You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
 To come home to and love
 
 You'll never know just how much I miss you
 You'll never know just how much I care
 
 And if I tried I still couldn't hide my love for you
 You ought to know for haven't I told you so
 A million or more times
 
 You went away and my heart went with you
 I speak your name in my every prayer
 
 If there is some other way to prove that I love you
 I swear I don't know how
 You'll never know if you don't know now
 
 You're an old smoothie
 I'm an old softie
 I'm just like putty in the hands of a boy like
 You
 
 You're an old meanie
 I'm a big boobie
 I just go nutty in the hands of a boy like you
 Poor me, you played me for a sap
 
 Poor you, you thought you'd laid a trap
 Well dear, I think it's time you knew
 You've done just what I wanted you to
 
 Silly old smoothie
 Crafty old softie
 I'll stick like putty to the hand of a boy like
 You
 
 
 You, you're driving me crazy! 
 What did I do? 
 What did I do? 
 My tears for you make everything hazy 
 Clouding the skies of blue 
 How true 
 Were the friends who were near me to cheer me 
 Believe, me they knew 
 But you 
 Were the kind who would hurt me, desert me 
 When I needed you 
 Yes you, you're driving me crazy! 
 What did I do to you?
 
 Love you which is easy to see
 But I have to keep guessing how you feel about me
 You listen to the words that I speak
 But I feel that you listen with your tongue in your cheek
 
 You're laughing at me
 I can't get sentimental
 For you're laughing at me I know
 
 I want to be romantic but I haven't a chance
 You've got a sense of humor, and humor is death to romance
 
 You're laughing at me
 Why do you think it's funny
 When I say that I love you so? 
 
 You've got me worried and I'm all at sea
 For while I'm crying for you
 You're laughing at me
 
 You're my thrill
 You do something to me
 You send chills right through me
 When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
 You're my thrill
 How my pulse increases
 I just go to pieces
 Every time I look at you I can't keep still
 Hm
 Nothing seems to matter
 Hm
 Here's my heart on a silver platter
 Oh where's my will
 Why this strange desire
 
 Flaming higher and higher
 Every time I look at you
 I can't keep still
 You're my thrill
 
 At words poetic I'm so pathetic
 That I always have found it best
 Instead of getting 'em off my chest
 To let 'em rest, unexpressed
 I hate parading my serenading
 As I'll probably miss a bar
 But if this ditty is not so pretty
 At least it'll tell you how great you are
 
 You're the top, you're the Collisseum
 You're the top, you're the Louvre Museum
 You're the melody from a symphony by Strauss
 You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeare sonnet, you're Mickey Mouse
 
 You're the Nile, you're the Tower of Pisa
 You're the smile of the Mona Lisa
 I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop
 But if baby, I'm the bottom, you're the top
 
 You're the top, you're Mahatma Gandhi
 You're the top, you're Napoleon brandy
 You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain
 You're the National Gallery, you're Garbo's salary, you're cellophane
 
 You're sublime, you're a turkey dinner
 You're the time of the Derby Winner
 I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop
 But if baby, I'm the bottom, you're the top
 
 You're the top, you're a Waldorf salad
 You're the top, you're a Berlin ballad
 You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire
 You're an O'Neal drama, you're Whistler's mama, you're camembert
 
 You're a rose, you're inferno's Dante
 You're the nose, on the great Durante
 I'm a lazy lout who is just about to stop
 But if baby, I'm the bottom, you're the top
 
 I've an awfully funny feeling that this thought
 That's been a-stealin' through my brain
 Is not to be ignored
 But to really tell the truth, though I'm not a
 Well-known sleuth
 I honestly believe that you are bored
 
 You've changed
 That sparkle in your eyes is gone
 Your smile is just a careless yawn
 You're breaking my heart
 You've changed
 You've changed
 Your kisses now are so blase
 You're bored with me in every way
 I can't understand
 You've changed
 You've forgotten the words "I love you"
 
 Each memory that we've shared
 You ignore every star above you
 I can't realize you ever cared
 You've changed
 You're not the angel I once knew
 No need to tell me that we're through
 It's all over now
 You've changed
 
 When you're down and troubled
 And you need a helping hand
 And nothing, nothing is going right
 Close your eyes and think of me
 And soon I will be there
 To brighten up even your darkest night
 
 You just call out my name
 And you know wherever I am
 I'll come running to see you again
 Winter, spring, summer or fall
 All you have to do is call
 And I'll be there
 You've got a friend
 
 If the sky above you
 Grows dark and full of clouds
 And that old north wind begins to blow
 Keep you head together
 And call my name out loud
 Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door
 
 You just call out my name
 And you know wherever I am
 I'll come running to see you again
 Winter, spring, summer or fall
 All you have to do is call
 And I'll be there
 
 Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
 When people can be so cold
 They'll hurt you, and desert you
 And take your soul if you let them
 
 You just call out my name
 And you know wherever I am
 I'll come running to see you again
 Winter, spring, summer or fall
 All you have to do is call
 And I'll be there
 You've got a friend
 You've got a friend
 
 Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
 Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
 
 You've got what gets me
 What gets me, you've got
 You've got what gets me
 I don't know just what
 
 But when you smile on me
 I get prouder and prouder
 My heart goes on a spree
 Beating louder and louder
 
 You've got what gets me
 You're simply a wow
 Let's you and let's me
 Sign up now
 
 This time I know it's love
 Here's the reason and rhyme
 You've got what gets me
 Every time
 
 You've got what gets me
 You're simply a wow
 Let's you and let's me
 Sign up now
 
 This time I know it's love
 Here's the reason and rhyme
 You've got what gets me
 Every time
 
 It begins to tell,
 'round midnight, midnight.
 I do pretty well, till after sundown,
 Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
 But it really gets bad,
 'round midnight.
 
 Memories always start 'round midnight
 Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
 When my heart is still with you,
 And ol' midnight knows it, too.
 When a quarrel we had needs mending,
 Does it mean that our love is ending.
 Darlin' I need you, lately I find
 You're out of my heart,
 And I'm out of my mind.
 
 Let our hearts take wings'
 'round midnight, midnight
 Let the angels sing,
 for your returning.
 Till our love is safe and sound.
 And old midnight comes around.
 Feelin' sad,
 really gets bad
 Round, Round, Round Midnight
 
 No one to talk with
 All by myself
 No one to walk with
 But I'm happy on the shelf
 Ain't misbehavin'
 I'm savin' my love for you
 
 I know for certain
 The one I love
 I'm through with flirtin'
 It's just you I'm thinkin' of
 Ain't misbehavin'
 I'm savin' my love for you
 
 Like Jack Horner
 In the corner
 Don't go nowhere
 What do I care?
 Your kisses are worth waitin' for
 Believe me
 
 I don't stay out late
 Don't care to go
 I'm home about eight
 Just me and my radio
 Ain't misbehavin'
 I'm savin' my love for you
 
 Like Jack Horner
 In the corner
 Don't go nowhere
 What do I care?
 Your kisses are worth waitin' for
 Believe me
 
 I don't stay out late
 Don't care to go
 I'm home about eight
 Just me and my radio
 Ain't misbehavin'
 I'm savin' my love for you
 
 The sea, the sky, the you and I
 The sea, the sky, for you and I
 I'll know we're all blues
 All Shades, all hues, all blues
 
 Some blues are sad
 But some are glad,
 Dark-sad or bright-gald
 They're all blues
 All shades, all hues, all blues
 
 The color of colors
 The blues are more than a color
 They're a moan of pain
 A Taste of strife
 And a sad refrain
 
 A game which lif is pplayin'
 Blues can be the livin' dues
 We're all a-payin'
 Yeah, Oh Lord
 
 In a rainbow
 A summer day that's fair
 A parayer is prayed
 A lament that's made
 
 Some shade of blues is there;
 Blue heaven's hue,
 They're all blues
 
 Talkin' 'bout the sea and the sky
 Andi'm talkin' 'bout you and I
 The sea, the sky
 For you and I
 
 And I know we're all blues
 All shades,
 All hues,
 All blues
 
 Sea, sky, you and I
 See the sky, you and I
 All Blues
 All shades, all hues, all blues
 
 Time and again I've longed for adventure,
 Something to make my heart beat the faster.
 What did I long for? I never really knew.
 Finding your love I've found my adventure,
 Touching your hand, my heart beats the faster,
 All that I want in all of this world is you.
 
 You are the promised kiss of springtime
 That makes the lonely winter seem long.
 You are the breathless hush of evening
 That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
 You are the angel glow that lights a star,
 The dearest things I know are what you are.
 Some day my happy arms will hold you,
 And some day I'll know that moment divine,
 When all the things you are, are mine!
 
 At last, my love has come along
 my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
 At last,the skies above are blue
 My heart was wrapped in clover
 Every since the night I looked at you
 
 And I found a dream that I could speak to
 A dream to call my own
 I found a thrill to press my cheek to
 A thrill I'd never known
 When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
 And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last
 
 I found a dream that I could speak to,
 A dream  to call my own
 I found a thrill to press my cheek to
 A thrill like I had never known
 You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
 And here we are in Heaven
 I found my love at last
 
 The falling leaves drift by the window
 The autumn leaves of red and gold
 I see your lips, the summer kisses
 The sun-burned hands I used to hold
 
 Since you went away the days grow long
 And soon I'll hear old winter's song
 But I miss you most of all my darling
 When autumn leaves start to fall
 
 C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
 Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
 Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
 Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
 Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
 Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
 Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis

 But I miss you most of all my darling

 Won't you come along with me
 To the Mississippi
 We'll take a boat to the land of dreams
 Steam down the river, down to New Orleans
 
 The band's there to meet us
 Old friends there to greet us
 Where all the proud and elite folks meet
 Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street
 
 Basin Street is the street
 Where the best folks always meet
 In New Orleans, land of dreams
 You'll never know how nice it seems,
 Or just how much it really means
 
 Glad to be, oh yes-sirree
 Where welcome's free and dear to me
 Where I can lose, lose my Basin Street Blues
 
 Basin Street, oh Basin Street
 Is the street, mama 
 New Orleans, land of dreams
 
 Don't worry I'm not looking at you
 Gorgeous and dressed in blue
 Don't worry I'm not looking at you
 Gorgeous and dressed in blue
 I know it drives you crazy
 When I pretend you don't exist
 When I'd like to lean in close
 And run my hands against your lips
 Though we haven't even spoken
 Still I sense there's a rapport
 So whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 Whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 Don't worry I'm not looking at you 
 Don't worry I'm not looking at you
 Gorgeous and dressed in blue
 Don't worry I'm not looking at you
 I know you see me see you
 As you see me walk on past
 When there's nothing more I'd like to do
 Then come in close and hear you laugh
 Though we haven't even spoken
 Still I sense there's a rapport
 So whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 Yea whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 Whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 Hmm whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 
 My heart is sad and lonely
 For you I sigh, for you dear only
 Why haven't you seen it
 I'm all for you body and soul
 
 I spend my days in longing
 And wondering why it's me you're wronging
 I tell you I mean it
 I'm all for you body and soul
 
 I can't believe it
 It's hard to conceive it
 That you'd turn away romance
 Are you pretending
 It looks like the ending
 Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear
 
 My life a wreck you're making
 You know I'm yours for just the taking
 I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
 
 My life a wreck you're making
 You know I'm yours for the very taking
 I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
 
 Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending
 Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
 It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
 It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
 The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
 Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
 So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
 Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
 Remember that you're mine sweetheart
 
 Goodnight my love, your mommy is kneeling beside you
 Goodnight my love, to dreamland the sandman will guide you
 Come now you sleepyhead, close your eyes, and go to bed
 My precious sleepyhead, you mustn't play peek-a-boo
 Goodnight my love, your little Dutch dolly is yawning
 Goodnight my love, your teddy bear called it a day
 Your doggy's fast asleep, my but he's smart
 Sleep tight, my love, goodnight my love
 
 Old man sunshine listen you
 Never tell me dreams come true
 Just try it and I'll start a riot
 Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
 Ever tell me he will care
 I'm certain it's the final curtain
 I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
 Who tell you fate supplies a mate
 It's all bananas
 
 They're writing songs of love but not for me
 A lucky star's above but not for me
 With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
 Than any Russian play could guarantee
 
 I was a fool to fall and get that way
 Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
 Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
 I guess he's not for me
 
 I was a fool to fall and get that way
 Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
 Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
 
 No one here can love or understand me
 Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
 Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 
 Where somebody waits for me
 Sugar's sweet, so is she
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 
 No one here can love or understand me
 Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
 Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
 Blackbird, bye, bye
 
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 Where somebody waits for me
 Sugar's sweet, so is she
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 
 No one here can love or understand me
 Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me
 Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
 Blackbird, bye, bye
 
 Darn that dream,
 I dream each night,
 you say you love me and you hold me tight,
 but when I awake your out of sight,
 oh darn that dream
 
 Darn your lips,
 darn your eyes,
 they left me high above the starry skies,
 then I tumble out of paradise,
 oh darn that dream
 
 Darn this one track mind of mine,
 it can't understand that you don't care,
 just to change the mood I'm in,
 I welcome a nice old nightmare,
 
 Darn that dream,
 and bless it too,
 without that dream I never would have you,
 but it haunts me and it won't come true,
 oh darn that dream
 
 Dear old Southland I hear you calling me.
 And I long how I long to roam 
 back to my old Kentucky home.
 Dear old Southland for you my heart is yearning
 And I long just to see once more
 
 Ever since the lucky night I found you
 I've hung around you just like a fool
 Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.
 
 My poor heart is in an awful state now
 But it's too late now to call a halt
 
 So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!
 
 Don't blame me for falling in love with you
 I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
 Don't' blame me!
 
 Can't you see when you do the things you do!
 If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
 Don't blame; me.
 
 Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
 Makes me need someone like you to love!
 
 Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
 And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
 But don't blame me.
 
 I like every single thing about you
 Without a doubt you are like a dream
 In my mind I find a picture of us as a team
 
 Ever since the hour of our meeting
 I've been repeating a silly phrase
 Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.
 
 Don't blame me for falling in love with you
 I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
 Don't' blame me!
 
 Can't you see when you do the things you do!
 If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
 Don't blame; me.
 
 Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
 Makes me need someone like you to love!
 
 Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
 And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
 But don't blame me.
 
 Oh 
 Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time 
 There was a sixteen year old virgin 
 Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh 
 Looking for my Donna 
 
 I just got back from looking for Donna 
 San Francisco 
 Psychedelic urchin 
 Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh 
 Looking for my Donna 
 
 Have you seen 
 My sixteen year old tattooed woman 
 Heard a story 
 She got busted for her beauty oh oh oh 
 Oh oh! 
 
 Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time 
 There was a sixteen year old virgin 
 Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh 
 Looking for my Donna 
 
 I've been to India and saw the yogi light  
 In South America the Indian smoke glows bright 
 I'm reincarnated and so are we all 
 And in this lifetime we'll rise 
 Before we fall 
 Before we fall 
 
 Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time 
 There was a sixteen year old virgin 
 Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh 
 Looking for my Donna 
 
 And I'm going to show her 
 Life on earth can be sweet 
 Gonna lay my mutated head  at her feet 
 And I'm gonna love her make love to her 
 Till the sky turns brown 
 I'm evolving I'm evolving 
 Through the drugs 
 That you put down 
 
 Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time 
 There was a sixteen year old virgin 
 Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh 
 Looking for my Donna 
 Looking for my Donna 
 
 Donna! 
 
 East of the sun and west of the moon
 We'll build a dream house of love dear
 Close to the sun in the day
 Near to the moon at night
 We'll live in a lovely way dear
 Sharing our love in the pale moonlight
 
 Just you and I, 
 Forever and a day
 Love will not die, 
 We'll keep it that way
 Up among the stars 
 We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune
 East of the sun and west of the moon dear
 East of the sun and west of the moon
 
 I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
 In thinking such a thing could be
 That you could ever care for me
 I'm sure you hate to hear
 That I adore you, dear
 But grant me
 
 Just the same
 I'm not entirely to blame
 For love
 You'd be so easy to love
 So easy to idolize
 All others above
 So worth the yearning for
 So swell to keep every home fire burning for
 
 We'd be so grand at the game
 So carefree together
 That it does seem a shame
 That you can't see
 Your future with me
 Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love
 
 Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
 Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!
 
 Just one look at you
 My heart grew tipsy in me,
 You and you alone
 Bring out the gypsy in me! 
 
 I love all, the many charms about you!
 Above all, I want my arms about you! 
 
 Don't be a naughty baby,
 Come to papa, come to papa, do!
 My sweet embraceable you!
 
 What is the musical topic, of the day?
 Bebop so the critic's say, well that was OK!
 Who were the originators, do you know?
 Yardbird and Dizzy tell me, I think its quite so
 
 Now I'm just holding thumbs like, Toscaninni and La Cost
 Well, as long as I'm hip to it, I think I'm hipper to the how,
 Explain it to the folks
 
 Bebop my friends was just a whole lotta fun!
 You could take any old riff, and make a real long run.
 
 It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
 A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
 Romance was the theme
 And we were the players
 I never think of this without a sigh
 
 Lover, one lovely day
 Love came, planning to stay
 Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
 The setting for nights beyond forgetting
 And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
 When I recall the love I found on
 I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
 Lover, one lovely day
 Love came, planning to stay
 Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
 The setting for nights beyond forgetting
 And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
 When I recall the love I found on
 On Green Dolphin Street
 
 Of the wonderful things that you get out of life there are four.
 And they may not be many but nobody needs any more.
 Of the many facts making the list of life,
 Truth takes the lead.
 And to relax knowing the gist of life,
 It's truth you need.
 
 Then the second is honor and happiness makes number three.
 When you put them together you know what the last one must be.
 Baby so truth, honor and happiness
 And one thing more,
 Meaning only wonderful, wonderful love that'll make four.

 When you put them together you know what the last one must be.
 Baby so truth, honor and happiness
 And one thing more,
 Meaning love and that's the real score and more than enough when times are tough and poor.
 They may not comprise a lot
 Still  only got those four.
 And there ain't no more.
 
 Goodnight my love, the tired old moon is descending
 Goodnight my love, my moment with you now is ending
 It was so heavenly, holding you, close to me
 It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream
 The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow
 Till then my love, how dreary the new day will seem
 So for the present, dear, we'll have to part
 Sleep tight, my love, goodnight, my love
 Remember that you're mine sweetheart

 How much do I love you?
 I'll tell you no lie
 How deep is the ocean?
 How high is the sky?
 
 How many times a day do I think of you?
 How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
 
 How far would I travel
 To be where you are?
 How far is the journey
 From here to a star?
 
 And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
 How deep is the ocean?
 How high is the sky?
 
 How far would I travel
 To be where you are?
 How far is the journey
 From here to a star?
 
 And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
 How deep is the ocean?
 How high is the sky?
 How high is the sky?
 
 Somewhere there's music
 How faint the tune
 Somewhere there's heaven
 How high the moon
 There is no moon above
 When love is far away too
 Till it comes true
 That you love me as I love you
 
 Somewhere there's music
 How near, how far
 Somewhere there's heaven
 It's where you are
 The darkest night would shine
 If you would come to me soon
 Until you will, how still my heart
 How high the moon
 
 Somewhere there's music
 How faint the tune
 Somewhere there's heaven
 How high the moon
 The darkest night would shine
 If you would come to me soon
 Until you will, how still my heart
 How high the moon
 
 If they ask me, I could write a book
 About the way you walk and whisper and look
 I could write a preface on how we met
 So the world would never forget
 
 And the simple secret of the plot
 Is just to tell them that I love you, a lot
 Then the world discovers as my book ends
 How to make two lovers of friends
 
 If they ask me, I could write a book
 About the way you walk and whisper and look
 I could write a preface on how we met
 So the world would never forget, never, never forget
 
 And the simple secret of the plot
 Is just to tell them that I love you, allot
 Then the world discovers as my book ends
 How to make two lovers of friends
 
 I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
 My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
 And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
 I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last
 My heart should be well schooled, 'cause I've been fooled in the past
 And still I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
 
 Though folks with good intentions
 Tell me to save my tears
 Well I'm so mad about him
 I can't live without him
 
 Never treats me sweet and gentle
 The way he should
 I've got it bad
 And that ain't good
 
 My poor heart is so sentimental
 Not made of wood
 I've got it so bad
 And that ain't good
 
 But when the fish are jumpin'
 And Friday rolls around
 My man an' I, we gin some
 We pray some, and sin some
 
 He don't love me like I love him
 The way he should
 I've got it bad
 And that ain't good
 Yes I've got it bad
 And that ain't good
 
 This lovely day will lengthen into evening
 We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
 Alone where we have walked together
 I'll remember April and be glad
 
 I'll be content you loved me once in April
 Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
 I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
 For I'll remember April and you
 
 The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
 For flames live such a little while
 I won't forget but I won't be lonely
 I'll remember April and smile
 
 I'm in the mood for love
 Simply because you're near me.
 Funny, but when you're near me
 I'm in the mood for love.
 
 Heaven is in your eyes
 Bright as the stars we're under
 Oh! Is it any wonder
 I'm in the mood for love?
 
 Why stop to think of whether
 This little dream might fade?
 We've put our hearts together
 Now we are one, I'm not afraid!
 
 If there's a cloud above
 If it should rain we'll let it
 But for tonight, forget it!
 I'm in the mood for love
 
 Ask me how do I feel
 Ask me now that we're cosy and clingin'
 Well, sir, all I can say
 Is if I were a bell, I'd be ringin'
 From the moment we kissed tonight
 That's the way I've just gotta behave
 Boy, if I were a lamp, I'd light
 Or if I were a banner, I'd wave
 
 Ask me how do I feel
 Little me with my quiet upbringing
 Well, sir, all I can say
 Is if I were a gate, I'd be swinging
 And if I were a watch
 I'd start popping my springs
 Or if I were a bell
 I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding
 
 Yes, I knew my morale would crack
 From the wonderful way that you looked
 Boy, if I were a duck, I'd quack
 Or if I were a goose, I'd be cooked
 
 Ask me how do I feel
 Ask me now that we're fondly caressing
 Well, if I were a salad
 I know I'd be splashing my dressing
 Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring
 Or if I were a gate, I would swing
 Have a fling almost any old thing
 Or if I were a bell
 I'd go ding dong, ding dong
 Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding, ding dong
 
 In a Sentimental Mood I can see
 The stars come through my room
 While your loving attitude is
 Like a flame that lights the gloom
 On the wings of ev'ry kiss
 Drift a melody so strange and sweet
 In this sentimental bliss you make
 My Paradise complete
 Rose pearls seem to fall
 It's all like a dream to call you mine
 My heart's lighter thing since you
 Made me this night a thing divine
 In A Sentimental Mood
 I'm within a world so heavenly
 For I never dreamt that you'd be
 Loving sentimental me
 In A Sentimental Mood I can see
 The stars come through my room
 While your loving attitude is
 Like a flame that lights the gloom
 On the wings of ev'ry kiss
 Drift a melody so strange and sweet
 In this sentimental bliss you make
 My Paradise complete
 Rose pearls seem to fall
 It's all like a dream to call you mine
 My heart's lighter thing since you
 Made me this night a thing divine
 In A Sentimental Mood
 I'm within a world so heavenly
 For I never dreamt that you'd be
 Loving sentimental me
 
 In the still of the night
 As I gaze from my window
 At the Moon in its flight
 My thoughts all stray to you
 
 In the still of the night
 While the world is in slumber
 Oh, the times without number
 Darling, when I say to you
 
 Do you love me as I love you
 Are you my life to be, my dream come true
 Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight
 Like the Moon growing dim on the rim of the hill
 In the chill, still of the night
 
 Back home again in Indiana,
 And it seems that I can see
 The gleamin' candlelight,
 Still shinin' bright,
 Through the sycamores for me.
 
 The new mown hay sends all its fragrance
 From the fields I used to roam.
 When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash,
 Then I long for my Indiana home.
 
 Oh, I have always been a wanderer
 Over land and sea,
 Yet a moonbeam on the water
 Casts a spell o'er me;
 A vision fair I see,
 Again I long to be;
 
 Back home again in Indiana,
 And it seems that I can see
 The gleamin' candlelight,
 Still shinin' bright,
 Through the sycamores for me.
 
 The new mown hay sends all its fragrance
 From the fields I used to roam.
 When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash,
 Then I long for my Indiana home,
 Indiana home.
 
 I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
 I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
 I'd say that I had spring fever
 But I know it isn't spring
 
 I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
 Like a nightingale without a song to sing
 Oh, why should I have Spring fever
 When it isn't even spring?
 
 I keep wishing I were somewhere else
 Walking down a strange new street
 Hearing words that I have never heard
 From a girl I've yet to meet
 
 I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
 I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
 I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
 But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
 That it might as well be spring
 
 It might as well be spring
 
 Once I laughed when I heard you saying
 That I'd be playing solitaire
 Uneasy in my easy chair
 It never entered my mind
 
 And once you told me I was mistaken
 That I'd awaken with the sun
 And ordered orange juice for one
 It never entered my mind
 
 You had what I lack, myself
 Now I even have to scratch my back myself
 
 Once you warned me that if you scorned me,
 I'd say the maiden's prayer again
 And wish that you were there again
 To get into my hair again
 It never entered my mind
 
 It never entered my mind
 
 Say, it's only a paper moon
 Sailing over a cardboard sea
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me
 
 Yes, it's only a canvas sky
 Hanging over a muslin tree
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me
 
 Without your love
 It's a honky tonk parade
 Without your love
 It's a melody played in a penny arcade
 
 It's a Barnum and Bailey world
 Just as phony as it can be
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me
 
 Say, it's only a paper moon
 Sailing over a cardboard sea
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me
 
 Yes, it's only a canvas sky
 Hanging over a muslin tree
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me
 
 Without your love
 It's a honky-tonk parade
 Without your love
 It's a melody played in a penny arcade
 
 It's a Barnum and Bailey world
 Just as phony as it can be
 But it wouldn't be make-believe
 If you believed in me
 
 It's phony it's plain to see
 How happy I would be
 If you believed in me
 
 Hello baby, I had to call you on the phone
 Hello baby, I had to call you on the phone
 `Cause I feel so lonesome
 And daddy wants his baby home
 
 It's a down-right rotten,
 Low down dirty shame
 It's a down right rotten
 low down dirty shame
 The way that you're treatin' poor me
 I know I'm not to blame
 
 Jelly jelly jelly
 Jelly stays on my mind
 Jelly jelly jelly
 Jelly stays on my mind
 Jelly roll killed my pappy,
 And wrung my mama stone blind.
 
 Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
 Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
 If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
 Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you
 
 Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
 We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
 If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
 To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you
 
 Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
 write these extended bridges
 can it be romance that always
 haunts me in my reverie?
 
 So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
 If you can come early I'll never be late
 And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
 To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
 just for me too
 
 Gather around, tale to be told
 Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend
 
 Blowin' away, doin' alright
 Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again
 
 Movin' along, coverin' ground
 Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then
 
 blow together birds of a feather
 Out playin' the blues and "I Got Rhythm"
 All at once a moment came without a warning
 Got so hot we had to cool it
 
 Go for glory, tell you the story
 Out payin' our dues until we found we were
 assisting at an unexpected borning
 'twas the birth of the Cool
 
 So now I can tell you why I'm always
 Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
 New York, and we're together in my reverie
 
 So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
 Forget all the others, just me and just you
 And while we're versifying
 We'd better start trying
 To write another song just for me
 Just for you, one more Jeru
 
 Just give me a June night
 The moonlight and you in my arms with all your charms
 The moon above and we'll make love.
 I'll hold you in full view
 Our dreams will come true
 
 Just give me a June night
 The moonlight and you
 Give me a June night
 Give me the moonlight
 But mostly give me you
 
 And when you're in my arms, 
 With all your charms and the moon above
 We're gonna make love, love, love
 I'll hold you, hold you, and hold you
 Then each little dream that we're dreaming will come true
 
 Just give me a June night
 The moonlight and you
 Gotta have you, under the moon
 Give me a June night
 
 Want you to know I go for your squeezin'
 Want you to know it really is pleasin'
 Want you to know  I ain't for no teasin'
 
 Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
 Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
 I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
 Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
 Missing you since you went away
 Singing the blues away each day
 Counting the rights and waiting for you 
 I'm in the mood to let you know 
 I never knew I loved you so 
 Please say you love me too 
 When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
 So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
 Treat me sweet and gentle when you say goodnight 
 Just squeeze me but please don't tease me
 I get sentimental when you hold me tight 
 Just squeeze me but please don't tease me 
 Missing you since you went away
 Singing the blues away each day
 Counting the rights and waiting for you 
 I'm in the mood to let you know 
 I never knew I loved you so 
 Please say you love me too 
 When I get this feelin' I'm in ecstasy
 So squeeze me but please don't tease me
 
 Just you, just me
 Let's find a cozy spot
 To cuddle and coo
 
 Just us, just we
 I've missed an awful lot
 My trouble is you
 
 Oh, gee!
 What are your charms for?
 What are my arms for?
 Use your imagination!
 Just you, just me
 I'll tie a lover's knot
 'Round wonderful you!
 
 Listen to my tale of woe, 
 It's terribly sad but true, 
 All dressed up, no place to go 
 Each evening I'm awfully blue. 
 
 I must win some handsome guy 
 Can't go on like this, 
 I could blossom out I know, 
 With somebody just like you. So
 
 Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
 Oh, lady, be good to me 
 I am so awfully misunderstood 
 So lady, be good to me 
 Oh, please have some pity 
 I'm all-alone in this big city 
 I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
 So lady be good to me. 
 
 Oh, please have some pity 
 I'm all alone in this big city 
 I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
 So lady be good to me. 
 Oh lady be good to me.
 
 Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
 You won't believe me that I love you only
 I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else
 
 You might find the night time the right time for kissing
 But night time is my time for just reminiscing
 Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
 There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you
 
 I intend to be independently blue
 I want your love but I don't want to borrow
 I have it today and give back tomorrow
 For my love is your love but there's no love for nobody else
 
 
 No one here can love or understand me
 Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
 Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 
 Where somebody waits for me
 Sugar's sweet, so is she
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 
 No one here can love or understand me
 Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
 Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
 Blackbird, bye, bye
 
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 Where somebody waits for me
 Sugar's sweet, so is she
 Bye, bye, blackbird
 
 No one here can love or understand me
 Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me
 Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
 Blackbird, bye, bye
 
 My old flame, I can't even think of his name but it's funny now and then
 How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame
 My old flame, my new lovers all seem so tame
 For I haven't met a gent so magnificent or elegant as my old flame
 
 I've met so many who had fascinating ways
 A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
 But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
 I can't even think of his name but I'll never be the same 
 Until I discover what became of my old flame
 
 I've met so many who had fascinating way 
 A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
 But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
 I can't even think of his name but I'll never be the same
 Until I discover what became of my old flame
 
 I reach for you like I'd reach for a star
 Worshipping you from afar
 Living with my silent love
 
 I'm like a flame dying out in the rain
 Only the ashes remain
 Smould'ring like my silent love
 
 How I long to tell
 All the things I have planned
 Still, it's wrong to tell
 You would not understand
 
 You'll go along, never dreaming I care
 Loving somebody, somewhere
 Leaving me my silent love
 
 You'll go along, never dreaming I care
 Loving somebody, somewhere
 Leaving me my silent love
 
 The man who only lives for making money
 Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
 Likewise the man who works for fame
 
 There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
 The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
 Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
 Fall in love and you won't regret it
 That's the best work of all, if you can get it
 Holding hands at midnight
 
 'Neath a starry sky
 Nice work if you can get it
 And you can get it if you try
 Strolling with the one girl
 Sighing sigh after sigh
 Nice work if you can get it
 And you can get it if you try
 
 Just imagine someone
 Waiting at the cottage door
 Where two hearts become one
 Who could ask for anything more?
 Loving one who loves you
 And then taking that vow
 It's nice work if you can get it
 And if you get it, won't you tell me how?"
 
 Just imagine someone

 It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
 A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
 Romance was the theme
 And we were the players
 I never think of this without a sigh
 
 Lover, one lovely day
 Love came, planning to stay
 Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
 The setting for nights beyond forgetting
 And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
 When I recall the love I found on
 I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
 Lover, one lovely day

 On Green Dolphin Street

 Oh lady be good to me.
 
 I look at you and suddenly
 Something in your eyes I see
 Soon begins bewitching me
 It's that old devil moon
 That you stole from the skies
 It's that old devil moon in your eyes
 
 You and you glance make this romance
 Too hot to handle
 Stars in the night
 Blazing their light
 Can't hold a candle
 To your razzle-dazzle
 
 You've got me flyin' high and wide
 On a magic carpet ride
 Full of butterflies inside
 Wanna cry, wanna croon
 Wanna laugh like a loon
 It's that old devil moon in your eyes
 
 Just when I think
 I'm free as a dove
 Old devil moon
 Deep in your eyes
 Blinds me with love
 
 It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
 A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
 Romance was the theme
 And we were the players
 I never think of this without a sigh

 Somewhere waiting for me
 There is someone I'm longing to see
 Someone I simply can't help but adore
 Someone who'll thrill me forever
 Some day my prince will come
 Some day I'll find my love
 And how thrilling that moment will be
 When the prince of my dreams comes to me
 He'll whisper, I love you,
 And steal a kiss or two
 Though he's far away,
 I'll find my love some day
 Some day when my dreams come true
 Some day I'll find my love
 Someone to call my own
 And I'll know her the moment we meet
 For my heart will start skipping a beat
 Some day we'll say and do
 Things we've been longing to
 Though she's far away
 I'll find my love some day
 Some day when my dreams come true
 
 Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
 Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
 No desire, no ambition leads me
 Maybe it's because nobody needs me
 Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
 Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
 Maybe it's because nobody loves me
 Spring is here I hear
 
 Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
 Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
 No desire, no ambition leads me
 Maybe it's because nobody needs me
 Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
 Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
 Maybe it's because nobody loves me
 Spring is here I hear
 
 Star eyes,
 That to me is what your eyes are,
 Soft as stars in April skies are,
 Tell me some day you'll fulfill
 Their promise of a thrill.
 
 Star eyes,
 Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
 Let me show you where my heart lies.
 Let me prove that it adores
 That loveliness of yours.
 
 All my life I've felt
 Content to stargaze at the skies.
 Now I only want to to melt
 The stardust in your eyes.
 
 Star eyes,
 When if ever, will my lips know
 If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
 Makes no diff'rence where you are,
 Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
 Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.
 
 And now the purple dusk of twilight time
 Steals across the meadows of my heart
 High up in the sky the little stars climb
 Always reminding me that we're apart
 You wander down the lane and far away
 Leaving me a song that will not die
 Love is now the stardust of yesterday
 The music of the years gone by.
 
 Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
 The lonely nights
 Dreaming of a song
 The melody 
 Haunts my reverie
 And I am once again with you
 When our love was new 
 And each kiss an inspiration
 But that was long ago
 And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
 
 Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
 You are in my arms
 The nightingale 
 Tells his fairytale
 Of paradise, where roses grew
 Though I dream in vain
 In my heart it will remain
 My stardust melody
 The memory of love's refrain.

 Old black magic has me in its spell
 Old black magic that you weave so well 
 Those icy fingers up and down my spine
 The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
 Same old tingle that I feel inside
 Then the elevator starts it ride
 
 Down and down I go
 Round and round I go
 Like a leaf caught in a tide
 I should stay away but what can I do 
 I hear your name and I'm a flame
 
 Flame, flame of desire 
 Only your kiss can put out the fire 
 Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
 Your the mate that fate had me created for 
 And every time your lips meet mine
 
 Down and down I go 
 Round and round I go 
 In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
 Under the old black magic called love
 In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
 Under the old black magic called love
 In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
 Under the old black magic called love
 I should stay away but what can I do 
 I hear your name and I'm a flame
 
 Flame, flame of desire 
 Only your kiss can put out the fire 
 Oh you are the lover I have waited for
 Your the mate that fate had me created for 
 And every time your lips meet mine
 
 Down and down I go 
 Round and round I go 
 In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
 Under the old black magic called love
 
 Someday he'll come along
 The man I love
 And he'll be big and strong
 The man I love
 And when he comes my way
 I'll do my best to make him stay
 
 He'll look at me and smile
 I'll understand
 Then in a little while
 He'll take my hand
 And though it seems absurd
 I know we both won't say a word
 
 Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
 Maybe Monday, maybe not
 Still I'm sure to meet him one day
 Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day
 He'll build a little home
 That's meant for two
 From which I'll never roam
 Who would, would you
 And so all else above
 I'm dreaming of the man I love
 
 Some day, when I'm awfully low,
 When the world is cold,
 I will feel a glow just thinking of you
 And the way you look tonight.
 
 Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
 And your cheeks so soft,
 There is nothing for me but to love you,
 And the way you look tonight.
 
 With each word your tenderness grows,
 Tearing my fear apart
 And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
 It touches my foolish heart.
 
 Lovely, never, ever change.
 Keep that breathless charm.
 Won't you please arrange it?
 Cause I love you 
 Just the way you look tonight.
 
 Mm, mm, mm, mm,
 Just the way you look tonight
 
 There is no greater love
 Than what I feel for you
 No greater love,
 No heart so true
 
 There is no greater thrill
 Than what you bring to me
 No sweeter song
 Than what you sing to me
 
 You're the sweetest thing
 I have ever known
 And to think that
 You are mine alone.
 
 There is no greater love
 In all the world, it's true
 No greater love
 Than what I feel for you
 
 You're the sweetest thing
 I have ever known,
 And to think that
 You are mine alone.
 
 There is no greater love
 In all the world, it's true
 No greater love
 Than what I feel for you
 
 Time after time I tell myself that I'm
 So lucky to be loving you
 So lucky to be 
 The one you run to see
 In the evening when the day is through
 
 I only know what I know
 The passing years will show
 You've kept my love so young, so new
 And time after time
 You'll hear me say that I'm
 So lucky to be loving you
 
 I only know what I know
 The passing years will show
 You've kept my love so young, so new
 And time after time
 You'll hear me say that I'm
 So lucky to be loving you
 
 When the day fades away into twilight
 The moon is my light of love
 In the night, I am quite a romancer
 I find an answer above
 To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
 This is my imagination.
 
 Time on my hands, you in my arms
 Nothing but love in view, then you fall
 Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
 Moments to spare for someone you care for
 Our love affair for two
 With time on my hands and you in my arms
 And love in my heart all for you.
 
 Listen to the melody entrancing
 Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
 As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
 Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
 Sweet music soft and mellow
 Soothing and slow
 Strains of a mellow 'cello
 When lights are low 
 Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
 Why think about the weather 
 When lights are low 
 Two hearts revealing
 Music hath charms 
 Life's so appealing
 With inspiration, in your arms 
 Our lips meeting soft and tender 
 Love's all aglow 
 Why shouldn't we surrender 
 When lights are low
 
 Listen how happy hearts are beating
 Like the ocean beats upon the sand
 And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
 Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
 Sweet music soft and mellow
 Soothing and slow
 Strains of a mellow 'cello
 When lights are low 
 Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
 Why think about the weather 
 When lights are low
 Two hearts revealing
 Music hath charms
 Life's so appealing
 With inspiration, in your arms 
 Our lips meeting soft and tender 
 Love's all aglow 
 Why shouldn't we surrender 
 When lights are low
 
 Don't worry I'm not looking at you
 Gorgeous and dressed in blue
 Don't worry I'm not looking at you
 Gorgeous and dressed in blue
 I know it drives you crazy
 When I pretend you don't exist
 When I'd like to lean in close
 And run my hands against your lips
 Though we haven't even spoken
 Still I sense there's a rapport
 So whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 Whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 Don't worry I'm not looking at you 
 Don't worry I'm not looking at you
 Gorgeous and dressed in blue
 Don't worry I'm not looking at you
 I know you see me see you
 As you see me walk on past
 When there's nothing more I'd like to do
 Then come in close and hear you laugh
 Though we haven't even spoken
 Still I sense there's a rapport
 So whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 Yea whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 Whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 Hmm whisper me your number
 I'll call you up at home
 
 Yesterdays, yesterdays
 Days I knew as happy
 Sweet sequester days
 Olden days, golden days
 Days of mad romance and love
 
 Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
 Joyous free and flaming life
 Forsooth, was mine
 Sad am I, glad am I
 For today I'm dreaming of yesterdays
 
 Yesterdays, yesterdays
 Days I knew as happy
 Sweet sequester days
 Olden days, golden days
 Days of mad romance and love
 
 Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
 Joyous free and flaming life
 Forsooth, was mine
 Sad am I, glad am I
 For today I'm dreaming of yesterdays
 
 Yesterdays, yesterdays
 Days I knew as happy
 Sweet sequester days
 Olden days, golden days
 Days of mad romance and love
 
 Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
 Joyous free and flaming life
 Forsooth, was mine
 Sad am I, glad am I
 For today I'm dreaming of yesterdays
 Yesterdays
 
 You don't know what love is
 'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
 Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
 You don't know what love  is.
 
 You don't know how lips hurt
 Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
 Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
 You don't know what love is.
 
 Do you know how a lost heart fears
 At the thought of reminiscing,
 And how lips that taste of tears
 Lose their taste for kissing?
 You don't know how hearts burn
 For love that can, not live yet never dies.
 Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
 You don't know what love is.
 
 You go to my head
 And you linger like a haunting refrain
 And I find you spinning round in my brain
 Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
 
 You go to my head
 Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
 And I find the very mention of you
 Like the kicker in a julep or two
 
 The thrill of the thought
 That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
 Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
 Can't you see that it never can be?
 
 You go to my head
 With a smile that makes my temperature rise
 Like a summer with a thousand July's
 You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
 
 Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
 Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
 You go to my head
 You go to my head
 
 You're my everything underneath the sun
 You're my everything rolled up into one
 You're my only dream, my only real reality
 You're my idea of a perfect personality
 
 You're my everything, everything I need
 You're the song I sing and the book I read
 You're a way beyond belief and just to make it brief
 You're my winter, summer, spring, my everything
 
 You're my everything 
 You're the song I sing and the book I read
 You're a way beyond belief and just to make it brief
 You're my winter, summer, spring, my everything
