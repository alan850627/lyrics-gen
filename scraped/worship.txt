Ten thousand reasons
For my heart to find

Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
Sing like never before
Oh my soul

When my strength is failing
The end draws near
And my time has come
Still my soul will
Sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years
And then forevermore
Forevermore

Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I'll worship Your Holy name

Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I'll worship Your Holy name
Yes I'll worship Your Holy name

To sing a greater song.

A greater song to You on the earth.
To sing a greater song.

Grand enough to tell of Your glory?

Our highest praise maybe a way
To whisper of Your highest worth.

To sing a greater song.

Here I am
I am so set free,
Caught up in this mystery.

Jesus there is a hope I breath,
You are in me,
You are in me

Hear I am with my chains undone,
Caught up in Your victory.

Singing songs of a higher love,
For You are with me,
You are with me.

And we are ever praising You!
You brought a blessing,
And the blessing was You. 

There was a treasure,
And the treasure was You! 

Before we had nothing, now  we have all things,
We were all lost but found the truth.

You brought a blessing,
And the blessing was You.

As I walk through the valley low,
I will build a place of hope.
Going on from strength to strength,
For You are in me,
You are in me.

Looking up to You with hope,
From the one that walks away.
Give it all for just one day that You are with me,
You are with me.

Yes, we are ever praising You!

You brought a blessing,
And the blessing was You. 

There was a treasure,
And the treasure was You! 

Before we had nothing, now  we have all things,
We were all lost but found the truth.

You brought a blessing,
And the blessing was You.
Ohh.
The blessing was You.

Hearts can find no rest until they find You!

You made us for Yourself and we will praise You!

We will praise You!

You brought a blessing,
And the blessing was You. 

There was a treasure,
And the treasure was You! 

Before we had nothing, now  we have all things,
We were all lost but found the truth.

You brought a blessing,
And the blessing was You.
Jesus, the blessing was You.
Jesus the blessing is You! You!
Oh, Jesus the blessing is You!

We have nothing to give
That didn't first come from Your hands
We have nothing to offer You
Which You did not provide
Every good, perfect gift comes from
Your kind and gracious heart
And all we do is give back to You
What always has been Yours

Lord, we're breathing the breath
That You gave us to breath
To worship You, to worship You
And we're singing these songs
With the very same breath
To worship You, to worship You

Who has given to You
That it should be paid back to him?
Who has given to You
As if You needed anything?
From You, and to You, and through You
Come all things, O Lord
And all we do is give back to You
What always has been Yours

We are breathing the breath
That You gave us to breath

Verse 1
Your mercy taught us how to dance
To celebrate with all we have
And we'll dance to thank You for mercy
Your glory taught us how to shout
We'll lift Your name in all the earth
And we'll shout to the praise of Your glory

Pre-Chorus
It's the overflow of a forgiven soul
And now we've seen You, God
Our hearts cannot stay silent

Chorus
And we'll be a dancing generation
Dancing because of Your great mercy, Lord
Your great mercy, Lord
And we'll be a shouting generation
Shouting because of Your great glory, Lord
Your great glory, Lord

When I stand before Your throne
Dressed in glory not my own
What a joy I'll sing of on that day
No more tears or broken dreams
Forgotten is the minor key
Everything as it was meant to be

And we will worship, worship
Forever in Your presence we will sing
We will worship, worship You
An endless hallelujah to the King

I will see You as You are
Love You with unsinning heart
And see how much You paid to bring me home
Not till then, Lord, shall I know
Not till then, how much I owe
Everything I am before Your throne

And we will worship, worship
Forever in Your presence we will sing
We will worship, worship You
An endless hallelujah to the King

No more tears, no more shame
No more sin or sorrow ever known again
No more fears, no more pain
We will see You face to face
See You face to face

An endless hallelujah to the King
We'll sing an endless hallelujah to the King
To the King
Sing an endless hallelujah
To You, to you
Forever and ever
And Ever and ever
Saints and angels
Living creatures
All the hosts of heaven
Hallelujah hallelujah
To You
An endless hallelujah

An endless hallelujah to the King
We'll sing an endless hallelujah to the King
To the King
Sing an endless hallelujah
To You, to you
Forever and ever
And Ever and ever
Saints and angels
Living creatures
All the hosts of heaven
Hallelujah hallelujah
To You
An endless hallelujah

An endless hallelujah to the King
We'll sing an endless hallelujah to the King
To the King
Sing an endless hallelujah
To You, to you
Forever and ever
And Ever and ever
Saints and angels
Living creatures
All the hosts of heaven
Hallelujah hallelujah
To You
An endless hallelujah

Welcomed in to the courts of the King/
I've been ushered into your presence/
Lord I stand on your merciful ground/
Yet with every step tread with reverence

And I'll fall facedown
As your glory shines around
Yes I'll fall facedown
As your glory shines around

Who is there in the heavens like you/
And upon the earth who's your equal/
You are far above you're the highest of heights/
We are bowing down to exalt you

So let your glory shine around!
Let your glory shine around!
King of glory here be found!
King of glory!

1. Father let me dedicate all this life to Thee
In whatever worldly state Thou would have me be
Not from sorrow, pain or care, freedom dare I claim
This alone shall be my prayer, glorify Thy name

2. Can a child presume to choose where or how to live?
Can a Father's love refuse all the best to give?
Let my glad heart, while it sings, There in all proclaim
And, whate'er the future brings, glorify Thy Name

Chorus:
Be glorified in me, be glorified
Be glorified in me, be glorified

So fearfully and wonderfully made,
How could they say
There is no God?

Reminded every breath that I take,
It's by Your hand I have been formed.

So what am I gonna do with this life
You gave me?
What could I do but live for Your praise?

You gave me this breath.
And You gave me this strength.
And everyday I live to obey You
With all of my heart,
With all of my soul.
Let every breath I breathe in display You, God.

Oh.
There's elegance in all You create.
Your grand designs leave us amazed.
The wonders of the way we've been made,
Speak of Your power,
And tell of Your grace.

So what am I gonna do with this life
You gave me?
What could I do but live for Your praise?

You gave me this breath.
And You gave me this strength.
And everyday I live to obey You
With all of my heart,
With all of my soul.
Let every breath I breathe in display You, God.

So what am I gonna do with this life
You gave me?
What am I gonna do with this life?
What am I gonna do in these days You gave me?
What am I gonna do with this life?

You gave me this breath.
And You gave me this strength.
And everyday I live to obey You
With all of my heart,
With all of my soul.
Let every breath I breathe in display You, God.

All my life, all my days,
How could they say there is no God?
How could they say there is no God?

This is a gifted response
Father, we cannot come to You by our own merit
We will come in the name of Your Son
As He glorifies You and in the power of Your Spirit

We have come to something so mysterious
Too deep for minds to comprehend
Through the open door where the angels sing
And the host of heaven are antheming
And we'll sing the glory of Your name
Celebrate the glories of Your grace
We will worship You, we will worship You
And we'll make Your praise so glorious
Singing songs of everlasting praise
We will worship You, we will worship You

Let our praise be Your welcome
Let our songs be a sign
We are here for You, we are here for You

Let Your breath come from heaven
Fill our hearts with Your life
We are here for You, we are here for You

To You our hearts are open
Nothing here is hidden
You are our one desire
You alone are holy
Only You are worthy
God, let Your fire fall down

Let our shout be Your anthem
Your renown fill the skies
We are here for You, we are here for You

Let Your Word move in power
Let what's dead come to life
We are here for You, we are here for You

To You our hearts are open
Nothing here is hidden
You are our one desire
You alone are holy
Only You are worthy
God, let Your fire fall down

Here is love, vast as the ocean
Loving kindness as the flood
When the Prince of Life, our Ransom
Shed for us His precious blood
Who His love will not remember?
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be forgotten
Throughout Heaven's eternal days

On the mount of crucifixion
Fountains opened deep and wide
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide
Grace and love, like mighty rivers
Poured incessant from above
And Heaven's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love

No love is higher, no love is wider
No love is deeper, no love is truer
No lover is higher, no lover is wider
No love is like Your love, o Lord

What heart could hold the weight of Your love
And know the heights of Your great worth
What eyes could look on Your glorious face
Shining like the sun

What heart could hold the weight of Your love
And know the heights of Your great worth
What eyes could look on Your glorious face
Shining like the sun

You are holy, holy, holy
God most high and God most worthy
You are holy, holy, holy
Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are

Your name alone has power to raise us
Your light will shine when all else fades
Our eyes will look on Your glorious face
Shining like the sun
Who is like You, God?

You are holy, holy, holy
God most high and God most worthy
You are holy, holy, holy
Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are

The highest name of all
You are all You say You are

You are holy, holy, holy
God most high and God most worthy
You are holy, holy, holy
Jesus, You are
Jesus, You are

You are holy, holy, holy
God most high and God most worthy
You are holy, holy, holy

And You shall come again in glory
To judge the living and the dead
All eyes now look on Your glorious face
Shining like the sun
Who is like You, God?

Only You are holy

You are holy, holy, holy
God most high and God most worthy
You are holy, holy, holy

Pouring out the oil of love, as my worship to you
In surrender I must give my every part
Lord, receive this sacrifice of a broken heart

Jesus, what can I give, what can I bring
To so faithful a Friend, to so loving a King?
Savior, what can be said, what can be sung
As a praise of Your name for the things You have done?
Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part
Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart

This thankful heart
This thankful heart

You deserve my every breath, for You've paid the great cost
Giving up your life to death, even death on the cross
You took all my shame away, there defeated my sin
Open up the gates of heaven and have beckoned me in

To so faithful a Friend, to so loving a King?
Savior, what can be said, what can be sung

Jesus, I could sing
In the tongues of men and angels
But if I have not love
I am just a clanging cymbal, and empty sound

Chorus:
This is a love song
This is a love song
Jesus, a love song to You
A song of devotion, a reverent passion
Savior, a love song to You

Jesus, I could pray
With a faith that moves a mountain
But if I have not love
It is just a noise resounding, an empty sound

This is a love song to You
Hear our devotion

It's the overflow of hearts
As we gaze upon Your beauty
A reflection of Your worth
For we've seen a glimpse of You in Your glory, Lord

If you know you're loved by the King, sing, sing, sing.
If you know you're loved by the King, live for Him, live for Him.

As a praise of Your name for the things You have done?
Oh, my words could not tell, not even in part
Of the debt of love that is owed by this thankful heart

We'll bring an offering, unto You an offering
What can I, what can I, what can I sing as an offering, Lord?
I want to please Your heart
What can I give, what can I bring, what can I sing as an offering, Lord?

What can I give, what can I bring, what can I sing as an offering, Lord?
What can I bring to the King of kings?
Oh, what can I give, what can I bring, what can I sing as an offering, Lord?

Simply this I will offer up my life in spirit and truth
Pouring out the oil of love, as my worship to you
In surrender I must give my every part
Lord, receive this sacrifice of a broken heart

Lord, receive this sacrifice of a broken heart
Lord, receive this sacrifice of a broken heart

You are God in heaven, and here am I on earth.
So, I'll let my words be few.
Jesus, I am so in love with You.

And I'll stand in awe of You.
Yes, I'll stand in awe of You.
And I'll let my words be few.
Jesus, I am so in love with You.

The simplest of all love songs, 
I want to bring to You.
So, I'll let my words be few.
Jesus, I am so in love with You.
With You.

And I'll stand in awe of You,
Stand in awe of You.
Yes, I'll stand in awe of You,
Jesus, You.
And I'll let my words be few.
Jesus, I am so in love with You.

And I'll stand in awe of You,
Worship You.
Yes, I'll stand in awe of You,
I stand in awe of You.
And I'll stand in awe of You,
Forever Jesus!
Yes, I'll stand in awe of You.
And I'll stand in awe of You,
The splendor of You, the wonder of You!
Yes, I'll stand in awe of You,
Jesus, You!
And I'll let my words be few.
Jesus, I am so in love with You.

You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures today.

Lord, let Your glory fall, as on an ancient day.
Songs of enduring love, 
And then Your glory came.
And as a sign to You,
That we will love the same,
Our hearts will sing that song,
As we pray!
God, let Your glory come!

You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures today.

Voices in unison,
Giving You thanks and praise,
Joined by the instruments,
And then Your glory came.
Your presence like a cloud,
Upon that ancient day,
The priests were overwhelmed,
All because, because Your glory came!

You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good! You are good, and Your love endures today.
You are good!
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures today.

You are good to us, Lord!
You are so good, yesterday, today, and forever!
You never change!

A sacrifice was made,
And then Your fire came.
They knelt upon the ground,
And with one voice they prayed,
And they sang as we sing today,
That,
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures today.

You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures today.

You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
Oh, You are good, You are good, and Your love endures.
You are good, You are good, and Your love endures today, today.

Now boldly we approach
Not by earthly confidence
It's only Your blood

You became nothing, poured out to death
Many times I've wondered at your gift of life
And I'm in that place once again

And once again I look upon the cross where you died
I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside
Once again I thank you
Once again I pour out my life
Pour out our life's to you

Now you are exalted to the highest place
King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow
But for now I marvel at your saving grace
And I'm full of praise once again
Full of praise today
I'm full of praise once again

And once again I look upon the cross where you died
I'm humbled by your mercy and I'm broken inside
Once again I thank you
Once again I pour out my life

And through grace untold, to see You
With this heart unveiled, to know You
Lord, in Your pure light

How great the glory of Your name

I am not a stranger to mercy, for You found me
Wrapped Your truth around me
I am not a stranger to grace
I have seen it in Your face

I am not a stranger to kindness
We're the broken with Your life inside us
You have brought Your gospel to me
And I breathe it every day

How did I become Your miracle?
Now to take Your truth and tell the world

I'm going to take it to the streets
I'm going to sing it 'til we meet
Heaven is open
Come on all the earth rejoice

I'm going to take it to the streets
Wake up the dead heart from its sleep
Heaven is open
Now's the time to raise our voice

I will tell the world of this mercy, for You found me
Wrapped Your truth around me
I will tell the world of this grace
I have seen it at Your cross

I will tell the world of this kindness
We're the broken with Your life inside us
You have brought Your gospel to me
Help me live it every day

How did we become Your miracles?
Now to take Your truth and tell the world

The disease of my soul was spreading,
Eating me up on the inside,
Keeping my heart from the new life.

And now I see where I was headed,
For there is no cure that can save us,
Aside from Your mercy Lord Jesus.

Cause You stepped in with Your power,
Let forgiveness reign,
Your miracle within.

Thank You for healing me,
I was dieing beneath my shame.
But You brought me to life again
And I will say,
Thank You for freeing me.
I was dead to the truth of You,
But my healing was in Your wombs and now I sing,
Thank You for healing me.

Though outside I may waste away,
On the inside I'll be more alive everyday!
As I walk through times of pain and grief,
There's a deeper truth inside of me.
You have placed Your life inside of me.
So I say,

Thank You for healing me,
I was dieing beneath my shame.
But You brought me to life again

1. When the music fades
All is stripped away,
and I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart

Bridge:
I'll bring You more than a song, for a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

Chorus:
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You, all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You, all about You, Jesus

2. King of endless worth
No one could express how much You deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours, ev'ry single breath

When I survey the wondrous Cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain, I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

See from His head, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet?
Or thorns compose, so rich a crown

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live

Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

It's the beauty and the shame
It's the glory and the name
Wonderful Cross

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live

Could we live like Your grace is stronger than all our faults and failures
Could we live like Your love is deeper than our hearts could fathom
Could we live like this could we live like Your name is higher than every other power
Could we live like Your ways are wiser than our understanding
Could we live like this
Could we live like this

Life's too short to be the long haul,
Now this I know,
Now this I know.

Jesus, You can have it all,
My every breath,
My every breath.

I need Your power to live this life,
This I know,
This I know.

I can't do this by myself,
MyYourMy only hope,
My only hope.

As I walk this broken world,
Tune my life to heaven's song,
For I am Yours.

And when all is said and done,
Tune my life to heaven's song forever more,
Forever more.

I need Your power to live this life,
This I know,

Tune my life to heaven's song,
For I am Yours.

And when all is said and done,
Tune my life to heaven's song forever more,
Forever more.

I just wanna sing Your song.

You came to search and rescue
In love the Father sent You
Broke through the darkest night
You came to seek and save us
You came to liberate us
Jesus, You heard our cry
Jesus, You heard our cry

Where would we be without Your love
We'd still be lost in darkness
Where would we be without Your cross
You made a way to save us
O Your love, O Your love

You are the hope eternal
You are the light of this world
Jesus, our rescuer
We live our lives to thank You
How could we not adore You
Jesus, our rescuer
Jesus, our rescuer

Where would we be without Your love
We'd still be lost in darkness
Where would we be without Your cross
You made a way to save us
O Your love, O Your love

We're safe in the arms of Your embrace
Breathing in Your freedom
Lifting a song of highest praise
And breathing out Your anthem
O Your love, O Your love
Sing it
O Your love, O Your love

We couldn't escape
The sin and the shame
That kept us bound
We couldn't break through
We couldn't reach You
So You reached down

Where would we be without Your love
We'd still be lost in darkness
Where would we be without Your cross
You made a way to save us
O Your love, O Your love

We're safe in the arms of Your embrace
Breathing in Your freedom
Lifting a song of highest praise
And breathing out Your anthem
O Your love, O Your love
Sing it
O Your love, O Your love

O Your love, O Your love
Sing it
O Your love, O Your love
We keep on singing
O Your love, O Your love
Sing it
O Your love, O Your love

Jesus You're the only hope
Jesus, hope for all the world
Jesus You're the only hope
Jesus, hope for all the world
Jesus You're the only hope
There is no other way
Jesus, hope for all the world
Jesus You're the only hope
Jesus, hope for all the world

Worthy, You are worthy
Much more worthy than I know
I cannot imagine
Just how glorious You are
And I cannot begin to tell
How deep a love You bring
O Lord my ears have heard of You
But now my eyes have seen

You're worthy
You're worthy
You're worthy
You're worthy to be praised
Forever and a day

Glory, I give glory
To the One who saved my soul
You found me and You freed me
From the shame that was my own
And I cannot begin to tell
How merciful You've been
O Lord, my ears had heard of You
But now my eyes have seen

We'll sing an anthem of the highest praise
We'll sound an anthem of Your glorious name

Welcomed in to the courts of the King/
I've been ushered into your presence/
Lord I stand on your merciful ground/
Yet with every step tread with reverence

And I'll fall facedown
As your glory shines around
Yes I'll fall facedown
As your glory shines around

Who is there in the heavens like you/
And upon the earth who's your equal/
You are far above you're the highest of heights/
We are bowing down to exalt you

So let your glory shine around!
Let your glory shine around!
King of glory here be found!
King of glory!

Even though I walk
Through the valley
Of the shadow of death,
Your perfect love is casting out fear.

And even when I'm caught
In the middle
Of the storms of this life,
I won't turn back, I know You are near.

For I will fear no evil,
For my God is with me.
And if my God is with me,
Whom then shall I fear?
Whom then shall I fear?

Oh, no.
You never let go.
Through the calm, and through the storm

Oh, no. 
You never let go.
In every high and every low.

Oh, no.
You never let go,
Lord, You never let go of me.

And I can see a light
That is coming
For the heart that holds on,
A glorious light beyond all compare.

And there will be an end
To these troubles
But until that day comes,
Still I will praise You.
Still I will praise You.

For I will fear no evil,
For my God is with me.
And if my God is with me,
Whom then shall I fear?
Whom then shall I fear?

Oh, no.
You never let go.
Through the calm, and through the storm

Oh, no. 
You never let go.
In every high and every low.

Oh, no.
You never let go,
Lord, You never let go of me.

Yes,I can see a light
That is coming
For the heart that holds on,
A glorious light beyond all compare.

And there will be an end
To these troubles
But until that day comes,
Still I will praise You.
Still I will praise You.

Yes, I can see a light
That is coming
For the heart that holds on,
A glorious light beyond all compare.

And there will be an end
To these troubles
But until that day comes,
Still I will praise You.
Still I will praise You.

Ohh.

Oh, no.
You never let go.
Through the calm, and through the storm

Oh, no. 
You never let go.
In every high and every low.

Oh, no.
You never let go,
Lord, You never let go of me.

You never let go.
Through the calm, and through the storm

Oh, no. 
You never let go.
every high, every low.

Oh, no.
You never let go,
Lord, You never let go of me.
You never let go, You never let go of me.

Oh listen when I say
What does it profit a man now
To gain a fortune
And lose his soul?
To be continued...

Can you hear, there's a new song
Breaking out from the children of freedom
Every race and every nation
Sing it out sing a new Hallelujah

Let us sing love to the nations
Bringing hope of the grace that has freed us
Make Him known and make Him famous
Sing it out sing the new Hallelujah

Arise
Let the church arise
Let love reach to the other side
Alive come alive
Let the song arise

Africa sings a new song
Reaching out with the new Hallelujah
Every son and every daughter
Everyone sing a new Hallelujah

Everyone sing a new Hallelujah
Everyone sing a new Hallelujah

I was throwin' away what I needed most
It was the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
A little carnal knowledge is a dangerous thing
It'll eat a hole in the brain
I'd be the biggest fool in the whole universe
To trade a heavenly blessing for a worldly curse
I was a weaker man 'til I made my stand
Now I am here to make a change

I'm running blind on the wheels of faith
 moving to the beat of a heart that prays
 hangin' on every word you said
I get a little stronger every day

Ain't ganna find any help on the T.V.
Or written down on the pages of People Magazine
It takes digging a little deeper into the Good Book now
For a little sacred advice...oh yah

Gettin' strong, a stronger now, every day
Gettin' strong, a stronger now, every day
I'm getting stronger

Can you hear, there's a new song
Breaking out from the children of freedom
Every race and every nation
Sing it out sing a new Hallelujah

Let us sing love to the nations
Bringing hope of the grace that has freed us
Make Him known and make Him famous
Sing it out sing the new Hallelujah

Arise
Let the church arise
Let love reach to the other side
Alive come alive
Let the song arise

Africa sings a new song
Reaching out with the new Hallelujah
Every son and every daughter
Everyone sing a new Hallelujah

Arise
Let the song arise
Let love reach to the other side
Alive come alive
Let the song arise

Whoa whoa, whoa whoa yeah

From New York down to Houston!

Arise
Let the church arise
Let love reach to the other side
Alive come alive
Let the song arise

Everyone sing a new Hallelujah
Everyone sing a new Hallelujah

The wind is moving
But I am standing still
A life of pages
Waiting to be filled
A heart that's hopeful
A head that's full of dreams
But this becoming
Is harder than it seems
Feels like I'm

Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world

If there are millions
Down on their knees
Among the many
Can you still hear me?
Hear me asking
Where do I belong?
Is there a vision
That I can call my own?
Show me I'm

Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world

Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world

Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world

Caught in a dream of where I want to be
Wrapped in a web of where I am
I feel a wall between what is and what should be
You find me waiting for a miracle
You hear me praying for a plan
You are the only one prepared to rescue me

Then You take away the distance
Found between the truth and me
And You give a simple reason to my restless rhyme
Whoa, hide me in the heaven
You have held within Your hand
And make a way to find a way to soothe my mind

There is a way that might seem right to me
A dim reflection of what's good
Just an illusion of the best that I can be
But there's another path You offer me
I wish I always understood
Some way You see right through my thoughts
And know my needs

All hail the power of Jesus name let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all
Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all

Ye chosen seed of Israel's race, Ye ransomed from the fall
Hail Him who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all
Hail Him who saves you by His grace, and crown Him Lord of all

Raise up the crown, rise on the praises
Rest on the brow of the King of the ages

O that with yonder sacred throng we at His feet may fall
We'll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all
We'll join the everlasting song, and crown Him Lord of all

Crown Him Lord of all
Crown Him Lord of all

Sad goodbye
Never quite got said
Now the time is gone
We're moving on
Even though it hurts so bad

If I could
I'd turn back the days
And I'd love again
To be your friend
In a hundred different ways

But we can't turn back the time
The days

So if I never said, all I needed to say
I'll say it now
You know I loved you once
I love you stronger than day
Please love, find me a way
Words, I still need to say
But I don't know how

Can't stand still
Still I can't move on
Lord, I need your strength
Need you and me
'Cause a part of me is gone

In time, I will know
What I've yet to see
That through all the pain
You hurt the same
And you're standing here with me

More than anything it's you
I need

So if I never said, all I needed to say
I'll say it now
You know I loved you once
I love you stronger than day
Please love find me a way
Words, I still need to say
Please show me how

So if I never said, all I needed to say
I'll say it now
You know I loved you once
I love you stronger than day
Please love find me a way
Words, I still need to say
But I don't know how
Please love find me a way
Please show me how

All I have in this world
Is fire from above
All I have in this world
Is you
And all the journeys I have walked
I know you've walked them too
All I want is to be faithful
All I want is you

All I have is a love
That set my world on fire
Let it fall, let it burn in me
And oh to be a friend of God is all that I desire
All I want is to be faithful
All I want is you

Never gave you nothin'
People couldn't explain away
Never gave you nothin'
Without something to gain
Never could slow down enough
To study a face, but now
I wanna know your name

Hold my feet to the fire
'Til I'm breaking a sweat
'Til I never forget
Your calling
Keep me on the line
Give me the nerve
Here it's all in the serve

Locked in the diamond lane
I kept driving past it
Better to be safe than learn
What you're about
Give me another chance
To go where you're going now
I'm here to walk it out
I'm here to walk it out
I'm here to walk it out

It's all in the serve
It's all in the serve
Here it's all in the serve

All is well all is well
Angels and men rejoice
For tonight darkness fell
Into the dawn of love's light
Sing Ale
Sing Alleluia

All is well all is well
Let there be peace on earth
Christ's come go and tell
That He is in the manger
Sing Ale
Sing Alleluia

All is well all is well
Lift up your voices and sing
Born is now Emmanuel
Born is our Lord and Savior
Sing Alleluia

This Christmas season I wish you joy
The wonder in every girl and boy
I wish you gladness, the one 
Have good friends and family gathered near

May children's laughter in falling snow
Rekindle those sweet scenes from long ago
May every carol, each candle bright
Remind you why angels sang that night

If trouble finds you, this is my prayer
May peace come into your hearts and make you strong
And I wish you luck, the kind to last all year long

It's over the line, a shadow of doubt
From outside looking at the "In Crowd"

They look mighty fine, a sight to behold
But all that glitters is not gold

All you're missin' is a heartache
A disillusion for a keepsake
A life of living with your own mistake
All you're missin' is a heartache

The water is high, you're out on a limb
Well, if you take the fall then it's "sink or swim"

You're kissing the dark
You're courting your pride
You wonder is it greener on the other side

All you're missin', missin' is a heartache
All you're missin', missin' is a heartache
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine
But God, Who called me here below
Will be forever mine
Will be forever mine
You are forever mine

Amazing Love, Amazing Grace
Amazing Love, Amazing Grace

Holy words long preserved
for our walk in this world,
They resound with God's own heart
Oh, let the Ancient words impart.

Words of Life, words of Hope
Give us strength, help us cope

Ancient words will guide us Home.

Ancient words ever true
Changing me, and changing you.
We have come with open hearts
Oh let the ancient words impart.

Handed down to this age.
Came to us through sacrifice

Jack is in the corner
The dish is with the spoon
The sheep is in the meadow
The cow is on the moon
But I am here with you and I believe
There's no other place I'd rather be
And a promise not to leave you
Is a promise I can keep

You're my muse
You're my rhyme
You're the fire warming this heart of mine
When you hear me say "I love you"
Anna, do you know how much I do?

So I watch you from a distance
Getting lost within your world
You pretend to be a princess
As you flutter and you twirl
Fragile as the flower in your hair
Dancing in your castle, unaware
That a single day without you
Would be more than I could bear

Little Anna, little star
That is what you really are
Cross my heart and hope to die
You're the apple of my eye

In the space of the beginning
Was the living Word of Light
When this Word was clearly spoken
All that came to be was right
All creation had a language
Words to say what must be said
All day long the heavens whispered
Signing words in scarlet red

Some failed to understand it
So God spoke His final Word
On a silent night in Judah's
Hills a baby's cry was heard

"Glory!" sang the angel chorus
"Glory!" echoed back the night
Love has come to walk among us
Christ the Lord is born this night

All creation sing His praises
Earth and heaven praise His name
All who live come join the chorus
Find the words His love proclaim

Find the words His love proclaim

Our Father, which art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name

As we forgive our debtors

Our Father, which art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name

Our Father, which art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name

And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us, deliver us from evil

For Thine is the Kingdom, and all the power
And the glory
Forever Amen

Our Father, which art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy Kingdom come
Thy Will be done
On Earth as it is in Heaven

Sin and its ways grow old
All of my heart turns to stone
And I'm left with no strength to arise
How You need to be lifted high

Sin and its ways lead to pain
Left here with hurt and with shame
So no longer will I leave Your side
Jesus, You'll be lifted high

You'll be lifted high, You'll be lifted high
You'll be lifted high in my life, oh God
And I fall to my knees, so it's You that they see not I
Jesus, You'll be lifted high

And even now that I'm inside Your house
Help me not to grow prideful again
Don't let me forsake sacrifice
Jesus, You'll be lifted high

And if I'm blessed with the riches of kings
How could I ever feel that it was me?
For You brought me from darkness to light
Jesus, You'll be lifted high

You'll be lifted high, You'll be lifted high
You'll be lifted high in my life, oh God
And I fall to my knees, so it's You that they see not I
And Jesus, You'll be lifted high

Oh Jesus, You'll be lifted high, oh, You'll be lifted high
Oh, You'll be lifted high in my life, oh God
And I fall to my knees, so it's You that they see not I
Jesus, You'll be lifted high, yeah, yeah

My servant, now your time has come
You have a job to do
I have a people to be led
And a willing heart in you
So I give you strength and courage
And I'll hide you in my hand
For Joshua, you gotta live for your call
Take my people to their land

So be strong and courageous
So be strong and courageous
You know you gotta be strong and courageous
So be strong and courageous

Never should you fear my call
Just listen and obey
Discouragement need never fall
Stand on the words I say
You know I led your fathers here
And you know I'll lead you too
Inscribe my law into your soul
And nothing will touch you

So be strong and courageous
So be strong and courageous
You know you gotta be strong and courageous
So be strong and courageous

Wasn't it long ago
Wasn't it on a New England coast
Wasn't it the standard - people praying to
The Son and the Father and the Holy Ghost
One nation over God
Is that what we've now become?
The founding fathers left a noble legacy
To their sons and daughters
To their sons and daughters
Look at what we've done
Look at what we've done

Chorus:
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
As we learn to bite the hand
That tries to feed us
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
If we say that we are free
Who will believe us
If we breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
Breakdown, break

See the powder on the glass
See the pillow on the street
See the charter of a modern love
With no obligations...or promises to meet

Hear the fear of disease
Hear the baby never born
Hear a people crying out
"Somebody save us - oh, please somebody save us
From what we're headed for - from what we're headed for"

Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown

Seeking mercy
Tell me there's a place for these
What of the children who have never felt a love
Tender as the morning
Nursing the bruises
And the scars that never seem to go away

What of the babies who have never left the womb
Breathing in the lifeline
Angels in waiting
Gone before they could be given wings to fly

What of the noble who are searching for the truth
With truest of intentions
And yet they're jaded by
Hypocrisies behind cathedral walls

What of the humble and the meek that knew despair
And never got their moment
But sacrificed a life of comfort
So that others knew no pain

 

What of the ones who call you Lord
But play the field
with faithless indecision
Forgive us father for we truly
Do not know what we have done

Carols sing to the King
Jesus Christ our Saviour
Born this day, angels say
In a lowly manger
He came down to the earth
Bringing us new birth
Carols sing to the King
Jesus Christ our Saviour

Tidings bring! Hail the King!
Shepherds did adore Him
From afar, by the star
Wise men sought and found Him
Son of God, Son of Man
All in all I see
Carols raise His name praise
He shall reign eternally
Carols sing to the King
Jesus Christ our Saviour

Christ the Messiah
Savior
Christ the Messiah

Our God is with us now

Angels sing it

Emmanuel Emmanuel

Our God is with us now

Christmas angels sing all around us
Spread good tidings over the earth
Telling of a child in a manger who is born
He is the King of kings

King of glory, hope for our nations
Sent to earth to save and redeem
Prince of peace, behold and adore
The Son of God has come to set us free

Celebrate and sing Hallelujah
Raise the banner, dance and rejoice
Celebrate the birth of Messiah
He's the King of King, the Lord of all

Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in the highest
Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna in the highest

We sing, joy to the world, the Lord has come
Joy to the world, the Lord has come
Joy to the world, He is here forever and always

Christmas angels sing all around us
All creation hears what they say
Bow before Him, come and behold
The Son of God born on Christmas day

Joy to the world, the Lord has come

Snow covered rooftops
Lights on the trees
The sound of singing
I hear down every street

Families have gathered
From miles away
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day

You see that old tree
Down Cotton Lane
Those lights keep shining
It's always the same

We hear the church bells
Ring out to say
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day

Swing the lights and hang the stockings
Decorate with green and red
Made the cookies for old Santa
Made a runway for his sled

Singing carols on a sleigh ride
Gather 'round the manger scene
Open presents, read the letter
And together we will sing

Oh, Merry Christmas
Joy to the world
For every nation
For every boy and girl

Let's light a candle
For peace we pray
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day
It's Christmas day
It's Christmas day

Let's light a candle
For peace we pray
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day

Frosted window panes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree

Santa's on his way
He's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me

It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say

Merry Christmas
May your New Year's dreams come true
And this song of mine
In three quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too!

Frosted window panes

Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Just look and you'll see

Santa's on his way

He's filled his sleigh

With things
Things for you and for me

It's that time of year

When the world falls in love

Every song you hear seems to say

Merry Christmas
May your New Year's dreams come true
And this song of mine
In three quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too!

Ring Christmas bells
Ring them loud with the message bringing
Peace on the earth
Tidings of good cheer
Come carolers
Come and join with the angels singing
Joy to the world
Christmastime is here again

Children gather around and listen
You'll hear the sound
Of angels filling the sky
Telling everyone
Christmas time is here

Loved ones close to our hearts
and strangers in lands afar
Together share in the joy
Emmanuel
He has come to dwell
With one voice
Let the world rejoice

There's not a world of difference
Out in the world tonight
Between this world of people
Red, Yellow, Black and White
But instead of riding a rainbow of love
We still are fighting with prejudice gloves
Of anger
With something to claim
But nothing to gain so

Why can't we be color blind
You know we should
Be living together
And we'd find a reason and rhyme
I know we would
Cause we could see better
If we could be color blind

Somebody's just assuming
He's up to nothing good
Cause he's not like the others
There goes the neighborhood
What kind of world are we living in
When we judge a man by the tone of his skin
It's crazy
Cause he has a heart
Like you have a heart and

Why can't we be color blind
You know we should
Be living together
And we'd find a reason and rhyme
I know we would
Cause we could see better
If we could be color blind

It'd be so fine
To be color blind
To open our eyes
And see color blind

I know this world would be a better place
The only race would be the human race
All of those barriers would be erased
Why can't we be color blind

Why can't we be color blind
You know we should
Be living together
And we'd find a reason and rhyme
I know we would
Cause we could see better
If we could be color blind

Come see, come see with spirit eyes
Come see, the door is open
Come near, come weary and ashamed
Come near, His arms are open, His arms are open

Come live, come live in freedom here
Come live, the chains are broken
Come rest, come take His gift of grace
Come rest, the word is spoken, the word is spoken

Come see, come see with spirit eyes
Come see, the door is open
Come home, come lay your burdens down
Come home, His arms are open, His arms are open
His arms are open, His arms are open, His arms are open

His arms are open, His arms are open
His arms are open, His arms are open
His arms, His arms are open, His arms are open
His arms are open, His arms are open, His arms are open

The chains are broken, the chains are broken
His arms are open, His arms are open, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah
The world is broken, oh yeah, His arms are open

Mourner, wherever you are
Wherever you are at the cross there is room
Tell your burdened hearts
Your burdened heart at the cross there is room

Tell it in the Savior's ear
Cast away your every fear
Only speak and He will hear

Hallelujah, everyone
Everyone can come to the cross
It doesn't matter what you've done
Everyone can come to the cross

Sinner, come today
Come today, at the cross there is room
Blessed thoughts for everyone
For everyone can come to the cross

Now a living fountain, see
Open there for you and me
For rich and poor, for bond and free, oh yeah

Hallelujah, everyone
Everyone can come to the cross
I say it doesn't matter what you've done
Everyone can come to the cross, oh yeah

Tell it in the Savior's ear
Cast away your every fear
Only speak and He will hear

Hallelujah, everyone
And everyone can come to the cross
I say it doesn't matter what you've done
Everyone can come to the cross, oh yeah

Woah, woah
Everyone can come to the cross, oh yeah
Woah, woah
I say everyone can come to the cross, oh yeah

Been here for days 
I'm amazed at this teacher 
Carpenter, preacher
Lost in the crowd, I hear him now 
He's praying and He's saying, God feed them all
Five thousand men, all of His friends
Are worried find bread and hurry
Five loaves and fish, what can He wish
He's praying still He's saying, God feed them all

Could He be the Messiah
Miracle man, part of the plan
Could He be the Messiah
Life in His hand
I understand He could be

Meet for our needs fully 
He feeds our hunger older and younger
Twelve baskets more, can we ignore 
He shows us that He knows us, is He the Christ
God in His eyes, I realize His power, need of the hour
Jesus is His name, they say He came to feed us 
And to receive us, is He the Christ

Could He be the Messiah
Miracle man, part of the plan
Could He be the Messiah
Life in His hand
I understand He could be

It is He the Messiah
Miracle man, part of the plan
It is He the Messiah
Life in His hand
I understand it is He

Could He be the Messiah
Miracle man, part of the plan
Could He be the Messiah
Life in His hand
I understand He could be

In the darkness and in the flood
You're there with me, You're there with
And in the desert and in the sun
You're holdin' me, You're holdin' me, yeah

You cover me with Your love
You cover me with, You cover me with Your love
You cover me with, You cover me with Your love

When my strength is faltering
You carry me, You carry me
When the world is damaging
You fix in me, You fix in me, yeah, hey

You cover me with Your love
You cover me with, You cover me with Your love
You cover me with, You cover me with Your love
You cover me with, You cover me with Your love

In the darkness and in the flood, You're there with me
You cover me with love, yeah
And in the desert in the sun, You're holdin' me
You cover me with love, yeah

And when my strength is faltering
You carry me
You cover me with love

You cover me with Your love
You cover me with, You cover me with Your love
You cover me with, You cover me with Your love

You cover me with, You cover me with Your love
You cover me with, You cover me with love, oh yeah
You cover me with love, Your love, oh yeah, yeah

Ink and paper, epic offers
Glass moon waltzing on the waters
Horse and carriage
I am courting the marriage
Of dreams in the wings
Of visions unseen

Cross my heart
Only your love will do
Cross my heart over you
Cross my heart
There is room enough for two
Cross my heart over you, over You

Inside, feels like there's a thunder
Spellbound, you've take me under
Gold and diamond
Ever saying that I'm in this forevermore
You can be sure

Where do you stand
What is your statement
What is it you're trying to say
What's in your hand
What's in your basement
What's in the cards you don't play
Are you holding the key
Or are you intending
To pick the lock of heaven's gate
It's confusing to me
The message you're sending
And I don't know if I can relate

What's you line
Tell me why you wear your cross of gold
State of mind
Or does it find a way into your soul

Is it a flame
Is it a passion
A symbol of love living in you
Or is it a game
Religion in fashion
Some kind of phase you're going through
We all travel the extremes
From cellar to rafter
Looking for a place in the sun
So I'm trying to see
What you're headed after
But I don't know where you're coming from

For some it's simply something 
to wear around your neck
Just a chain
Jewelry
Is it decoration
Is it an icon
Or proclamation
An icon of what
What
For some it's simply something 
to wear around your neck
Just a chain
It means a lot more than that to me

What's you line
Tell me why you wear your cross of gold
State of mind
Or does it find a way into your soul

Crown Him with many crowns,
The lamb upon the throne:
Hark! How the heav'nly anthem drowns
All Music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for thee,
And hail him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity.
Crown Him with many crowns
Crown Him with many crowns

Crown Him the Lord of Heav'n:
One with the Father known.
One with the Spirit through Him giv'n
From yonder glorious throne.
To Thee be endless praise.
For Thou hast died for me;
Be Thou, O Lord, through endless days
Adored and magnified

Adored and magnified
Crown Him with many crowns

His glories now we sing,
Who died and rose on high,
Who died eternal life to bring
And, lives that death may die.

Crown Him with many crowns

My life is like a racing car hurtling towards the wall
At the speed of sound
My time has been so finely tuned
But I've never seen a human being so tightly wound
At times it seems beyond belief
I just need a bit of relief
Like a war-weary soldier
Marching up and over the edge
Take my hand and pull me up cause I'm falling too fast
Somehow I've lost my way - I'm cryin' save me

Chorus
Can you hear me...I'm calling out
I'm crying out...a cry for love
I can feel you...you're touching me
You healing me...my cry for love

I will be the first to admit
I don't have the strength to handle it alone anymore
I don't have to fret, don't have to explain
All my worrying's in vain
I'm not alone anymore

Why is this so hard to believe
What is mine is mine to freely receive
Like the changing of seasons
This is the beauty of the word
And for all that I have seen and heard
Oh I want to come home
Somehow I'll make my way - my way home to you

Chorus

Bridge:
Oh Father hear my call 
I know you'll catch me when I fall
Oh Father hear my call 
I know you'll catch me when I fall
Oh I pray that you'll hold me now
Hold me
And take my fear away

I'm cryin' save me
Oh I know that you can hear me
Hear me crying out for love
Oh I know that you can feel my cry for love...ooh...

I can feel you - you're calling out
You're crying out - a cry for love
I can feel you - you're touching me 
You're healing me - my cry for love

Sitting at Your feet is where I want to be
I'm home when I am here with You
Ruined by Your grace, enamored by Your gaze
I can't resist the tenderness in You

I'm deep in love with You, Abba Father
I'm deep in love with You, Lord
My heart, it beats for You, precious Jesus
I'm deep in love with You Lord

Humbled and amazed that You would call my name
I never have to search again
There's a deep desire that's burning like a fire
To know You as my closest friend

Lord, my redeemer, Your blood runs through my veins
My love for You is deeper than it was yesterday
I enter through the curtain, parted by Your grace
Oh, Your the lover of my soul

Dreams within the still of night
On wings of hope take flight inside of me
There upon some distant shore
We want for nothing more than what will be
And you and I, here we are
I wonder as we've come this far

If I could only read your mind
Tell me the answer I would find
Do you dream of me?
And when you're smiling in your sleep
Beyond the promises we keep
Do you dream of me?

Love has found a magic space
A deep and hidden place where time stands still
Now I hold you in my arms
You know you hold my heart and always will

And you and I, here we are
And it's a wonder that we've come this far.

And after all that we've been through
You've leaned on me, I've leaned on you
Do you dream of me?
And when you're smiling in your sleep
Beyond the promises we keep
Do you dream of me?

If I could only read your mind
Tell me the answer I would find
Do you dream of me?
And when you're smiling in your sleep
Beyond the promises we keep
Do you dream of me?
And after all that we've been through
You've leaned on me, I've leaned on you.
Do you dream of me?

Dreams within the still of night
On wings of hope take flight inside of me
There upon some distant shore
We want for nothing more than what will be
And you and I, here we are
I wonder as we've come this far

If I could only read your mind
Tell me the answer I would find
Do you dream of me?
And when you're smiling in your sleep
Beyond the promises we keep
Do you dream of me?

Love has found a magic space
A deep and hidden place where time stands still
Now I hold you in my arms
You know you hold my heart and always will

And you and I, here we are
And it's a wonder that we've come this far.

And after all that we've been through
You've leaned on me, I've leaned on you
Do you dream of me?
And when you're smiling in your sleep
Beyond the promises we keep
Do you dream of me?

If I could only read your mind
Tell me the answer I would find
Do you dream of me?
And when you're smiling in your sleep
Beyond the promises we keep
Do you dream of me?
And after all that we've been through
You've leaned on me, I've leaned on you.
Do you dream of me?

I remember when you took a stand
With the pearl of wisdom in your hand
And a soul of desire
You hold your own up against the world
A lion's heart in a little girl
So unafraid of the fire

But those days don't last
Sweet dreams die fast
A stumble when you walk on the wire
When all your friends
Start giving in
The flames are burning higher and higher

Don't give up, Andrea
Got the whole world at your feet
Just keep on holding on
This is where you need to be

All the days that you've been spending
Spinning while your heart's descending
Like a stone in the ocean
Sometimes when you think the world is ending
It's really just a new beginning
The other side of emotion

But I've seen your eyes
No compromise
When you set your mind on the matter
Be strong through the tears
And your sight will clear
You're gonna get what you're after

Don't be surprised when the road divides
Just take the one less traveled by

Draw me close to you
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear you say that I'm your friend
You are my desire
No one else will do
'Cause nothing else can take your place
To feel the warmth of your embrace
Help me find the way
Bring me back to you

You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know you are near

Draw me close to you
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear you say that I'm your friend
You are my desire
No one else will do
'Cause nothing else can take your place
To feel the warmth of your embrace
Help me find the way
Bring me back to you

You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know you are near

You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know you are near

Help me know you are near
Help me know you are near

Draw me close to you
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear you say that I'm your friend
You are my desire
No one else will do
'Cause nothing else can take your place
To feel the warmth of your embrace
Help me find the way
Bring me back to you

You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know you are near

Draw me close to you
Never let me go

You're all I want
Help me know you are near

You're all I want

You're all I want
Help me know you are near

Help me know you are near
Help me know you are near

I will run and not be weak
Hope has come
Renewed my strength
I have found what I did seek
And I'm ready to fly

All forgiven, all forgot
Heaven waits beyond the plot
Swing low, sweet chariot
Yes, I'm ready to fly

Father come to save my soul
Father come to
Make me whole
There was a price
He paid the toll
Gave me freedom to fly

And every battle, every war
You will be my shield and my sword
You know I'm waiting on You Lord
You give me freedom to fly

Watch the eagles fly
Gonna set your feet on high
On the wind, like a dove
Go on and fly
In the shadow of love

Fly, gonna fly

Yes, I'm watching you fly
He set your feet on high
On the wind, like a dove
Go on and fly
In the shadow of love

I will run and not be weak
Hope has come
Renewed my strength
I have found what I did seek
And I'm ready to fly

All forgiven, all forgot
Heaven waits beyond the plot
Swing low, sweet chariot
Yes, I'm ready to fly

Father come to save my soul
Father come to
Make me whole
There was a price
He paid the toll
Gave me freedom to fly

And every battle, every war
You will be my shield and my sword
You know I'm waiting on You Lord
You give me freedom to fly

Watch the eagles fly
Gonna set your feet on high
On the wind, like a dove
Go on and fly
In the shadow of love

Fly, gonna fly

Yes, I'm watching you fly
He set your feet on high
On the wind, like a dove
Go on and fly
In the shadow of love

Caught, in an endless time
Waiting for a sign
To show you where to go
Lost, in a silent stare
Looking anywhere
For answers you don't know

On the wire
Balancing your dreams
Hoping ends will meet their means
You feel alone
Uninspired
Well does it help you to
Know that I believe in you
You're an angel waiting for wings...Emily

You, going through this stage
It's a restless age
Young and insecure
Sill, there are doubts to fade
Moments to be made
And one of them is yours

On the wire
Balancing your dreams
Hoping ends will meet their means
But you feel alone
Uninspired
Oh does it help you to
Know that I believe in you
You're an angel waiting for wings
Oh, you're an angel waiting for wings...Emily

Emmanuel, Emmanuel
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
Wonderful Counsellor
Lord of Life, Lord of All
He is the Prince of Peace,
Mighty God, Holy One
Emmanuel, Emmanuel

On the day
You were saved
Heaven and hell marked you down
Angels praise
Devils raged
Life became a battleground
So when hell starts to move
And the enemy marches on you
Hang on, it's a fight
You've been marked by the army of night
You're a target

When your heart
Loved the dark
Hell could just leave you alone
With your life
Filled with light
You have become quite a foe

So when hell starts to move
And the enemy marches on you
Hang on, it's a fight
It's a battle of darkness and light

When things get bad and you can't stand to look
It's time to read to the end of the book
Don't put it down 'til you get to the end
When Jesus come and His Kingdom begins
'Til He comes
God the Son
Teaches us to use the sword
And every fight
Has a light
When you know we win the war

So when hell starts to move
And the enemy marches on you
Hang on, it's a fight
You're a part of the army of light

It's like staring at the sky above
When I look in your eyes
Now where in the world did you come from?
You're so beautiful and I know

Oh, I can't escape your love
Escape your love, escape your love
I can't escape your love
Escape your love, escape your love

Every time I turn around you're there
I get a feeling that won't go away
Nothing else in this whole world compares
You're surrounding me and I know

That I can't escape your love
Escape your love, escape your love
I can't escape your love
Escape your love, escape your love

And in the righteous crowd
Your face is all I see
I hope you know by now
That I just can't escape, yeah

Oh, I can't escape your love
Escape your love, escape your love
Oh, I can't escape your love
Escape your love, escape your love

Oh, I can't escape your love
Escape your love, escape your love, oh yeah, yeah

The longing in my heart has stirred a faded memory
Of my young heart beating fast behind the willow tree
I was counting out loud, and I only peeked a time or two
And the only purpose in my life was finding you
Singing, "Ollie, ollie, everybody free!"
Now was I chasing you or were you chasing me?

We all grow up and put away our childhood games
But deep inside I wonder if we really change
'Cause I'm still seeking, though I've learned to hide so well
And I can still remember how it felt
Singing, "Ollie, ollie, everybody free!"
Will I ever find someone pursuing me?

And then you caught me by surprise
I found my tears are in your eyes
I hear my heart inside of you
At last I've found somebody who
Can free my soul
And love me too

I can't believe we hide so long and run so well
When all the while we're aching to be caught and held
But it's only in surrender that our freedom comes
And so I run abandoned to your waiting arms
Singing "Ollie, ollie, everybody free!"
I belong to you and you belong to me!

Singin' "Ollie, ollie, everybody free

Darkness thick and heavy,
Black and steady screaming darkness
Anyone who hates his brother,
Who plans evil for another
Walks in darkness
Sonlight, warm and shining,
Purifying, welcome Sonlight
Everyone who loves completely
With a heart that opens freely
Walks in Sonlight

Let us love in the light
For love is from God
If we love what is right
We show whose we are
In a world of the dying
We're living our parts
If we love in the light
With all of our hearts

Blindness, terrifying, left for dying, spirit blindness
Anyone who thirsts for evil plots
His very own upheaval
Lost in blindness
New sight, truth unending, faith unbending, new sight
Everyone who seeks the father leaves the world
And all it's bother
Sees with new sight

Fly to the moon
Well, you could do it if you wanted to
Try flying high
The only limit is the endless sky
So, go on and fly to the moon

Live in the sun
You know your living has just begun
So much ahead
Don't let the night leave you for dead
So, come on, live in the sun

Fly to the moon
And when you find your wings I will celebrate with you
Watch you as you soar
Take the wishes that are yours
And let them fly you to the moon

Dream on a star
You can let it take you near or far
Feet on the ground
Don't let anybody hold you down
So, go on and dream on a star

Fly to the moon
And when you find your wings
I will celebrate with you
Watch you as you soar
Take the wishes that are yours
I know you can fly to the moon
You can do all things
I will celebrate with you
It's hard to let you go
Still, you have to go,
I know

So go on, fly to the moon
And as you spread your wings
I will celebrate with you
Hope we taught you good
Hope you know that if I could
I would fly away with you

Gotta take it all the way
When you follow dreams
Follow far
Flying high and away
You're flying all the way
To the moon

Fly to the moon
Well, you could do it if you wanted to
Try flying high
The only limit is the endless sky
So, go on and fly to the moon

Live in the sun
You know your living has just begun
So much ahead
Don't let the night leave you for dead
So, come on, live in the sun

Fly to the moon
And when you find your wings I will celebrate with you
Watch you as you soar
Take the wishes that are yours
And let them fly you to the moon

Dream on a star
You can let it take you near or far
Feet on the ground
Don't let anybody hold you down
So, go on and dream on a star

Fly to the moon
And when you find your wings
I will celebrate with you
Watch you as you soar
Take the wishes that are yours
I know you can fly to the moon
You can do all things
I will celebrate with you
It's hard to let you go
Still, you have to go,
I know

So go on, fly to the moon
And as you spread your wings
I will celebrate with you
Hope we taught you good
Hope you know that if I could
I would fly away with you

Gotta take it all the way
When you follow dreams
Follow far
Flying high and away
You're flying all the way
To the moon

Sittin' in the rain
Water on your brain
Got a hole in your boat
Trying to stay afloat
Has got you down
I've got a wind in my sail
Rubber boots and a pail
I'll throw you a line
Rest assured that I
Won't ever let you drown

Cause when you're up against the wall
You know I'll be here for you, for you
When you rise and when you fall
I'll always be here for you, for you

When the plans you make
Fall through and take you
For a loop
Or some bird has flown the coop
And left you stranded
Just lean on me
And together you see
We'll carry the load
Even if we don't
Quite understand it

Give thanks to the Lord, Our God and King
His love endures forever
For He is good, He is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise

With a mighty hand and outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that's been reborn
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise

Forever God is faithful
Forever God is strong
Forever God is with us
Forever and ever, forever

From the rising to the setting sun
His love endures forever
By the grace of God we will carry on
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise

Forever God is with us

Packing up the dreams God planted
In the fertile soil of you
Can't believe the hopes He's granted
Means a chapter in your life is through
But we'll keep you close as always
It won't even seem you've gone
'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong

And friends are friends forever
If the Lord's the Lord of them
And a friend will not say never
'Cause the welcome will not end
Though it's hard to let you go
In the Father's hands we know
That a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends

With the faith and love God's given
Springing from the hope we know
We will pray the joy you'll live in
Is the strength that now you show
But we'll keep you close as always
It won't even seem you've gone
'Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong

And friends are friends forever
If the Lord's the Lord of them
And a friend will not say never
'Cause the welcome will not end
Though it's hard to let you go
In the Father's hands we know
That a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends

And friends are friends forever
If the Lord's the Lord of them
And a friend will not say never
'Cause the welcome will not end
Though it's hard to let you go
In the Father's hands we know
That a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends
No, a lifetime's not too long
To live as friends

Packing up the dreams
God planted
In the fertile soil of you
I can't believe the hopes He's granted
Means a chapter in your life is through

We'll keep you close as always
It won't even seem you've gone
Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong

And friends are friends forever
If the Lord's the Lord of them
And a friend will not say "never"
Cause the welcome will not end
Though it's hard to let you go
In the Father's hands we know
That a lifetime's not too long to live as friends

With the faith and love that God's given
Springing from the hope we know
We will pray the joy you'll live in
Is the strength that now you show

But we'll keep you close as always
It won't even seem you've gone
Cause our hearts in big and small ways
Will keep the love that keeps us strong

And friends are friends forever
If the Lord's the Lord of them
And a friend will not say "never"
Cause the welcome will not end

In the Father's hands we know
That a lifetime's not too long to live as friends

She asked him for forever
And a promise that would last
He said, babe you know I love you
But I can't commit to that
She said, love isn't love
'Till you give it away

A father lived in silence
Saw his son become a man
There was a distance felt between them
'Cause he could not understand
That love isn't love
'Till you give it away
You gotta give it away

As we live
Moving side by side
May we learn to give
Learn to sacrifice

We can entertain compassion
For a world in need of care
But the road of good intentions
Doesn't lead to anywhere
Cause love isn't love
'Till you give it away
You gotta give it away

As we live
Moving side by side
May we learn to give
Learn to sacrifice

Love is like a river
Flowing down from the giver of life
We drink from the water
And our thirst is no longer denied
You gotta give it away

As we live
Moving side by side
May we learn to give
Learn to sacrifice

There was a man who walked on water
He came to set the people free
He was the ultimate example
Of what love can truly be
'Cause his love was his life
And he gave it away
You gotta give it away

As we live
Moving side by side
May we learn to give
Learn to sacrifice

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the pains
And the mountains in reply
Echo back their joyous strains
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo

Come to Bethlehem and see

Him whose birth the angels sing

Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King

Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo

Angels we have heard on high

Sweetly singing o'er the plains

Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth
With us sing our Savior's birth

Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo

Alleluia

I'm blazing a trail that leads to vice
So easily enticed
By darker means
When out of the wilderness of choice
I hear that one still voice
Call to me

Go west young man
Go west young man
When the evil go east
Go west young man
Go west young man
Find a heart that's golden

Why must I wander like a cloud
Following the crowd
Well I don't know
But I'm asking for the will to fight
To wear the crown of life
And you say go

The mind is weak the heart is frail
When it goes beyond the pale
So unwise

Actions have been justified
All is compromised
Looking for approval there
In someone else's eyes, oh
Dodging all you really are
Becomes your greatest task
Acting out your lonely part
You hide behind your mask

Never true to yourself
Knowing well this is not like you
Fooling yourself
You're just living a lie

Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions

Victim of the circumstance
Prisoner of the shame
But it's the double standard life
That keeps you in the game
Taken by your own disguise
But when it's wearing thin
You'll do anything it takes
To impress your friends

Never true to yourself
Knowing well this is not like you
Fooling yourself
You're just living a lie

Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions

Never true to yourself
Knowing well this is not like you
Fooling yourself
You're just living a lie

Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions
Goin' goin'
Goin' through the motions

I was lost when You found me here
You pulled me close and held me near
And I'm a fool but still You love
I'll be Your fool for the King of love

He gave me wings so I could fly
And gave me a song to color the sky
And all I have is all from You
And all I want is all of You

It's grace, grace
I'm nothing without You
Grace, Your grace
Shines on me

And there've been days when I've walked away
Too much to carry
Nothing left to say
Forgive me Lord when I'm weak and lost
You traded heaven for a wooden cross

And all these years You've carried me
You've been my eyes when I could not see
And beauty grows in the driving rain
Your ode of gladness in the times of pain

It's grace, your grace
I'm nothing without You
Grace, Your grace
Shines on me

Your grace, Your grace
I'm nothing without You
Grace, Your grace
Shines on me, oh yeah

Shines on me
Shines on me
I'm everything with You
Shines on me
Shines on me
It's Your grace
Shines on me
Your grace, oh

Your grace it shines on me
Your grace
Your grace
Shines on me
Shines on me
Your grace it shines on me
Your grace
It shines on me

Just to rest in your arms
Close enough to hear your heart
Just to kneel at your feet
Where everything fades away and I sing

Jesus, Jesus, take me over now
I surrender
Everything I have, I lay it down
All of me

With just a glimpse of your face
All my fears melt away
Lost within your embrace
I'm pouring out all my admiration

Just to rest in your arms
Close enough to hear your heart
Just to kneel at your feet
Where everything fades away and I sing

Jesus, Jesus, take me over now
I surrender
Everything I have, I lay it down
All of me

With just a glimpse of your face
All my fears melt away
Lost within your embrace
I'm pouring out all my admiration

Providence, Providence
See it laying down the cornerstone
The Hand of Providence, it's evident
For we could never make it on our own
Apportioning the power
Weighing all that it entails
Giving us the fulcrum
And a balance to the scales

Oh, the Hand of Providence
Is guiding us through choices that we make
Oh, the Hand of Providence
Is reaching out to help us on our way

Providence, ever since
Any thesis ever entered man
The Hand of Providence
Has been our best defense
Tho' his ways are sometimes hard to understand
From the dying of a heartbeat
To another soul reborn
From in between and circling
Our thoughts of love and war

Oh, the Hand of Providence
Is guiding us through choices that we make
Oh, the Hand of Providence
Is reaching out to help us on our way

Let the tempest and the flood
Shake your soul and spill your blood
Like an old song
Keep hold'n on
Let the people laugh at you
Call you names and say you're through
Never let go
Keep hangin' on

Hang on, hang on
Can you hear me,
I'm gonna say it again
Hang on, hang on
Never giving up, no, never giving in

Hang on every hopeful word
Even when it seems absurd
Keep holdin' on
If you triumph when you fail
Keep your head when you prevail
Be a hero
Keep hangin' around

Hang on, hang on
Are you listening,
Let me say it again
Hang on, hang on
Never giving up, no,
Never giving in

Let the tempest and the flood
Shake your soul and spill your blood
Like an old song
Keep hold'n on
Let the people laugh at you
Call you names and say you're through
Never let go
Keep hangin' on

Hang on, hang on
Can you hear me,
I'm gonna say it again
Hang on, hang on
Never giving up, no, never giving in

Hang on every hopeful word
Even when it seems absurd
Keep holdin' on
If you triumph when you fail
Keep your head when you prevail
Be a hero
Keep hangin' around

Hang on, hang on
Are you listening,
Let me say it again
Hang on, hang on
Never giving up, no,
Never giving in

Oh the happiest Christmas
Is a homecoming Christmas
With the snow fluttering down 'til the world seems new

Bright candles burning
Old friends returning
The wishes of children coming true
And the happiest wishes are just old fashioned wishes
May your days be merry, your sorrows be small
May the ones you love be near you
That's the happiest Christmas of all

repeat chorus

Healing rain is coming down
It's coming nearer to this old town.
Rich and poor, weak and strong
It's bringing mercy, it won't be long.

Healing rain is coming down
It's coming closer to the lost and found.
Tears of joy and tears of shame
Are washed forever in Jesus' name.

Healing rain, it comes with fire
So let it fall and take us higher.
Healing rain, I'm not afraid
To be washed in Heaven's rain.

Lift your heads, let us return
To the mercy seat where time began.
And in your eyes I see the pain.
Come soak this dry heart with healing rain.
And only you, the Son of Man
Can take a leper and let him stand.
So lift your hands, they can be held
By someone greater, the Great I Am.

So let it fall and take us higher.

Let it rain, let it rain
Open the floodgates of Heaven
Let it rain, let it rain
Open the floodgates of Heaven

The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad
Let the distance shores rejoice
Clouds and thick darkness surround him
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne
A fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side
His lightning lights up the world
The earth sees and trembles
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord
Before the Lord of all the earth
The Heavens proclaim His righteousness
And all peoples will see His Glory

We want to see Your Glory, God
Do you want to see His Glory
Lift your voices, lift your hands

Let it rain, let it rain.
Open the floodgates of Heaven
Let it rain, let it rain.
Open the floodgates of Heaven

When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless your heart
I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus

King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is yours
Every single breath
I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus
I'm sorry, lord, for the thing I've made it
And it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus

I'm coming back to the heart of worship,
And it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
And it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus

It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you

It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you

I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus
I'm sorry, lord, for the thing I've made it
And it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus

Where's the Navigator of your destiny?
Where is the Dealer of this hand?
Who can explain life and its brevity
Cause there is nothing here that I can understand

You and I have barely met
And I just don't want to let go of you yet

Noah, hello, goodbye
I will see you on the other side
Noah, sweet child of mine
I will see you on the other side

And so I hold your tiny hand in mine
For the hardest thing I've ever had to face
Heaven calls for you before it calls for me
When you get there, save me a place

A place where I can share your smile
And I can hold you for more than just a while

People say that time will heal 
But you know, they just don't feel what you feel 
Times are hard but God is so good 
He's never failed you, and He said He never would 

He see's your tears 
He fights your fears 

Hold on, help is on the way 
He said he'd never leave you or forsake you 
Stay strong 
Help is on the way 
He'd said he'd help you 
Just reach out and take his hand 

He knows your heart, He lifts your head 
He's always close enough to hear every word you said 
When you're weak, He said He's so much more 
His arm is long enough to reach you where you are 

He see's your tears 
He fights your fears 

Hold on, help is on the way 
He said he'd never leave you or forsake you 
Stay strong 
Help is on the way 
He'd said he'd help you 
Just reach out and take his hand 

Hold on, help is on the way 
He said he'd never leave you or forsake you 
Stay strong 
Help is on the way 
He'd said he'd help you 
Just reach out and take his hand 

Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way
Help is on the way

It can be wise
Or it can be a paradox
To seek solace in your solitude
And when it feels
Like you're living in a box
You need someone who believes in you
A promise true when tried
I'll be right here by your side
So whenever your need be
Know that you can lean on me

Chorus:
I'll help you find your way
I'll help you find your way
When you're lost in all the madness
When you're blinded by your doubt
When you need someone to be there for you
I'll help you find your way

Don't keep your thoughts
Locked behind your cellar door
All shrouded in a mystery
Just let them out
That's what friends are for
To give without giving the "third degree"
No need to be ashamed
I've been through' it just the same
So when your path misleads
Know that you can call on me

There's a place where I can go
Where the angels hear me pray
"I want to change
Yes I need Your touch"
I'm waiting here for You

And I fall, at Your feet
I'll give it all, until the day we meet
Here I am
Ready to give up my life for the One
Ready to pour out my heart for the Son
Here I am

Here I come to Your threshing floor
Where the angels fear to tread
I'm waiting here for the King of love
And to hold the hands that bled

And I fall, at Your feet
I'll give it all, until the day we meet

Here I am
Ready to give up my life for the One
Ready to pour out my heart for the Son

Light of the World
You stepped down into darkness
Open my eyes
Let me see
Beauty that made
This heart adore You
Hope of a life
Spent with You

Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely

To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin upon that cross

Hey you
Things to do
Live the life for faith and family
It's tough
With all that stuff
Filling your head
We know
The undertow
Could get us so we don't remember, but
Lest we ever
Lest we ever forget

Hey you, it's me
True lovers are we
Children under the sun
Two spirits in the name of One

Hey me
Got to be
Places to go and people there to see
No space
For back to base
And no time at all
We talk
Walk the walk
Run the race
And climb the ladder, but
If we ever
If we ever should fall

Sometimes the smoke clears
And I see things how they are
I see how we have come so far

Hallelujah, hallelujah, for our Lord God almighty reign
Hallelujah, hallelujah, for our Lord God almighty reign
Hallelujah, holy, holy 
Are you Lord God almighty
Worthy is the lamb
Worthy is the lamb
You are holy, holy,

Amen

You are holy, holy
Are you Lord God almighty
Worthy is the lamb 
Worthy is the lamb

You are holy, holy
Are you Lord God almighty
Worthy is the lamb 
Worthy is the lamb

Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord
Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna
King of Israel welcome to our hearts
Here to reign in righteousness
Oh Ruler of the world, Ruler of our hearts
Now ascend Your throne
You are the King of Kings

To Jerusalem, to the sons of man
Riding on in gentle strength
Oh come to save Your own, come to give Your life
The Kingdom is at hand
You are the King of Kings

 How long will we grovel at the feet of wealth and power
 How long will we bow down to that golden calf
How long will be too long
 How long will we curtsy to the whims of new religion
How long will we water down the truth
'Til truth is no more
How long will be too long

The power of faith and love
Can change the stuff we're made of
But still we wait
 How long will be too long

 How long will we drink from the chalice of indifference
Neither be hot or be cold
Can a sober soul know
How long will be too long

Is there not more to us
Than cursed dust to dust
I feel my hope fading
How long will be too long

How long will be too long

 How long will we travel from the ways that God intended
Won't it all tumble down if His holy wrath comes
How long will be too long

The power of faith and love
Can change the stuff we're made of
When will it be too late
How long will be too long
How long will be too long
How long will be too long

Tell me when the time we had slipped away
Tomorrow turned to yesterday and I don't know how

Tell me what can stop this river of tears
It's been building up for years for this moment now

Here I stand arms open wide
I've held you close, kept you safe
Till you could fly

Tell me where the road ahead is gonna bend
And how to harness up the wind and how to say goodbye

Tell me why does following your dreams
Take you far away from me and I knew that it would

Tell me how to feel the space you left behind
And how to laugh instead of cry and how to say goodbye

Here I stand arms open wide
I've held you close, kept you safe
Till you could fly

Tell me where the road ahead is gonna bend
And how to harness up the wind and how to say goodbye

God, for the life of me
I don't know why
We hurt each other
In the name of what is right.
God, for the life of me
I don't understand
Echos everyday of man's
Inhumanity to man.
Man's inhumanity to man.

There's a river of sorrow
Running through my heart.
Through the long night I will follow
The glimmer in the dark.
Lord, you are the human spark.

God, for the life of me
I cannot explain
How people born of love
Lose their way to hate.
Oh, there's gotta be a better way.

I am not passers by, I am not a white lie
I am not left to die, I am love, I am love
I am not feeling sad, I am not a few fad
I am not quickly mad, I am love, I am love

You can try to hide, you can try to run
But you'll never run far enough
This is my flesh, this is my blood
And I am love
You can fly up high, You can dig down deep
You can flee to the west
You can flee to the east
But you can't escape what I've done
I am love

I am not standing by, i am not letting go
I am not leaving you, i am love, i am love
My blood feel like the rain
I did not bleed in vain
But from my veins
I am love

I am not passers by, I am not a white lie
I am not left to die, I am love, I am love
I am not feeling sad, I am not a few fad
I am not quickly mad, I am love, I am love

You can try to hide, you can try to run
But you'll never run far enough
This is my flesh, this is my blood
And I am love
You can fly up high, You can dig down deep
You can flee to the west
You can flee to the east
But you can't escape what I've done
I am love

I am not standing by, i am not letting go
I am not leaving you, i am love, i am love
My blood feel like the rain
I did not bleed in vain
But from my veins
I am love

Looking at the future
Who can tell you what is going on
It seems we have become the generation
Of wars and bombs
And the heart grows weak
And the fear grows strong
That the day may come and it may not be very long
And you want to run
But you don't know where
So where do you go
I know
And I tell you

I am sure there will be a day
But it will not be like the nations say
The Lord will come when this life is through
And His deep desire is to be with you
Hearts will fly when the new world starts
And joy will rise like the morning star
God will meet every cry of the heart
And it's my prayer
I want you to be there

I like to think about the new creation
Things that God will do
So every now and then I stop and close my eyes
I enjoy the view
And the heart grows strong
And the fear grows weak
And I cannot wait for the new world to come to me
And while I dream
Oh, I pray for you
Cause He wants you to go
I know
And I tell you

Once upon a time
I was faithless, strutting blind
Through the valley of the lost
So now you find it rather strange
When you hear me claim the name
Of the one who bears the cross, and I say

I believe in You now
A new light is showing me how
I used to walk in the shadows of doubt
But I believe in you now

Will there ever come a day
When you follow in the way
Of the truth that sets you free?
To where the thunder of a voice
And the echo of a choice
Will bring you to your knees
No longer running through the night
A conversion to the light
Giving way to disbelief, and you say

I'm in the river that flows from your throne
Water of Life
Water of Life
It Covers me and I breath again
Your love is breath to my soul

I can hear Your voice as You sing over me
It's Your song of Hope breathing life into me
I can feel Your touch as I come close to You
And it heals my heart
You restore and renew

I'm in the river that flows from your throne
Water of Life
Water of Life
It Covers me and I breath again
Your love is breath to my soul

I can hear Your voice as You sing over me
It's Your song of Hope breathing life into me
I can feel Your touch as I come close to You
And it heals my heart
You restore and renew

This is my desire
To honor You
Lord with all my heart
I worship You
All I have within me
I give You praise
All that I adore is in You

Lord, I give You my heart
I give You my soul
I live for You alone
Every breath that I take
Every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

This is my desire
To honor You
Lord with all my heart
I worship You
All I have within me
I give You praise
All that I adore is in You

Lord, I give You my heart
I give You my soul
I live for You alone
Every breath that I take
Every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

Lord, I give You my heart
I give You my soul
I live for You alone
Every breath that I take
Every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

Lord, I give You my heart
I give You my soul
I live for You alone
Every breath that I take
Every moment I'm awake
Lord, have Your way in me

Seems like it was only yesterday
She was living here
Yea, she was living here
Lord knows why He's taken her away
It isn't very clear, no it isn't very clear
Into every life a little rain must fall
And losing one you love is like a storm
But storms are passing

I hear Leesha
Singing in heaven tonight
And in between the sadness
I hear Leesha
Telling me that she's alright

Life goes on even after life
That's what I believe
Yea, that's what I believe
Leesha's gone, but she will still survive
In a memory that I'm keeping here with me
Silencing the voice of mortal tragedy
Listening to whispers of the soul
All is peaceful

Everybody's talkin' in the homeroom
Plans are being made for after school
Should you tell them how you're really feelin'
Or go along and play it cool
Well, I know, I know
How it feels, I know, I know

Everybody's talkin', about a good time
Something tells you something isn't right
But when you're lonely and the pressure's on you
It's really hard to stand and fight

Well, I know, I know
How you feel

Torn between the mind of the crowd
And the matters of the heart

I know, I know
How you feel, I know, I know

There's a light that holds you in the darkness
There's a candle burning in the wind
And if you can lean upon the Father
You can find the strength within

Well, I know, I know
That you can

Now it seems like everybody's against you
And no one really cares

You don't know who to trust,
You don't know where to turn
Well at least you know you've got a prayer
So reach out for the one who understands you
Oh, He's been there

He knows, He knows
How you feel

Well, I know, that He knows, He knows
I know, I know, that He knows

Who is the you that no one else can see
In your heart, a lonely one afraid to be
Lost again, need a friend

You hide your soul to keep the hurt inside
All alone, your tears call out into the night
Is He there, does He care

Yes, I know your name
Every prayer you pray
I'm the One Who brought you to this place
The Voice Who sings to you
The Hand that clings to you
Oh My child, I've always known your name, known your name

I hold you close to me, close to heart
And this kind of love will find you anywhere you are
Never fear, I am here

Once a true believer
Once there was a fire in your soul
You were the epitome of blessed faith astir
With thirst for holiness
And hunger for the Word
Now you move in other circles
To the beat of different drums
And I see only glimpses of the one you used to be
The inspiration that you were to me'

I miss the way His love would dance within your eyes
I miss the way His heart was the soul of your life
And somewhere in the saddest part of heaven's room
Our Father sheds a tear for you
He's missing you, too

Some are calling you a prodigal
Some aren't calling you at all
But far away someone is calling you back home
Do you hear it anymore out there on your own

Once a true believer
Once there was a fire in your soul
You were the epitome of blessed faith astir
With thirst for holiness
And hunger for the Word
Now you move in other circles
To the beat of different drums
And I see only glimpses of the one you used to be
The inspiration that you were to me

Lord, You're leading me
With a cloud by day
And then in the night
The glow of a burning flame

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

And You take my hand
And You wash it clean
I know the promised land
Is light years ahead of me

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

And the eagle flies
And the rivers run
I look through the night
I can see the risin' sun

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

Well, the grass will die
And the flowers fall
But Your Word's alive
Will be after all

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

Lord, You're leading me
With a cloud by day
And then in the night
The glow of a burning flame

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

And You take my hand
And You wash it clean
I know the promised land
Is light years ahead of me

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

And the eagle flies
And the rivers run
I look through the night
I can see the risin' sun

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

Well, the grass will die
And the flowers fall
But Your Word's alive
Will be after all

And everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you

Said it's sad, said it was a shame
Bet you thought I caught a boat to Bombay
On the line just to let you know
I will be around

Underneath the bridge to nowhere
Like I'm livin' out a game of solitaire
Goin' up to a better day
I will be around

Hey world, it's me
I still have the heart, still have the dream

Come on, people
We've got to come together
It's you and me
Hope will make us stronger
Freedom it rings
Do you hear it calling
Reach out and touch
And love will take us higher

Somebody threw a brick at my vision
Tried to sabotage my mission
Either way, I believe
I will be around

I want to know, people are you with me
Open up your heart and just believe 
Take a step, let me hear you say
I will be around

Hey world, it's me
I still have the heart, still have the dream

For He knows the plans He has for you
A plan to prosper and not to harm you
To give you a future, and a hope

All to Jesus
I surrender
All to Him
I freely give
I will ever love and trust Him
In His presence daily live

I surrender all
I surrender all
All to Thee, my blessed Savior
I surrender all

Todo a Cristo yo me rindo
Con el fin de serte fiel
Para siempre quiero amarle
Y agradarle solo a El

Yo me rindo a 'l
Yo me rindo a 'l
Todo a Cristo yo me entrego
Quiero serle fiel

Yo me rindo a 'l
Yo me rindo a 'l
Todo a Cristo yo me entrego
Quiero serle fiel

I saw you
And you saw me
And I didn't even know your name
Just one look
That was all it took
And I knew I'd never be the same
If walkin' on air compares to what I feel
Then how can I keep it sealed when

I want to tell the world
If the smile on my face
Hasn't given me away already
I want to tell the world
There ain't no way to hide it
Your love has got me flyin' high
Since the day

That you looked my way
I knew we were meant to be together
Now I thank the Lord
For a love like yours
'Cause I know it's gonna last forever
It's hard to believe my dreams have all come true
And I'm so in love with you that

I want to tell the world
If the smile on my face
Hasn't given me away already
I want to tell the world
There ain't no way to hide it
Your love has got me flyin' high
Since the day

I just want the world to know
Love has got me good to go

I have got to get it out
She is all I think about

It's something' that I need to say
Love has overtaken me

I want to tell the world
If the smile on my face
Hasn't given me away already
I want to tell the world
There ain't no way to hide it
Your love has got me flyin' high
Since the day

When you feel the sunlight
Fade into the cold night
Don't know where to turn
I don't know where to turn
And all the dreams you're dreaming
Seem to lose their meaning
Let me in your world
Baby, let me in your world
All you need is someone you can hold
Don't be sad, you're not alone

I will be here for you
Somewhere in the night
Somewhere in the night
I'll shine a light for you
Somewhere in the night
I'll be standing by
I will be here for you

In this world of strangers
Of cold and friendly faces
Someone you can trust
Oh there's someone you can trust
I will be your shelter
I'll give you my shoulder
Just reach out for my love
Reach out for my love
Call my name and my heart will hear
I will be there, there's nothing to fear

I will be here for you
Somewhere in the night
Somewhere in the night
I'll shine a light for you
Somewhere in the night
I'll be standing by
I will be here for you

I will be here for you
Somewhere in the night
Somewhere in the night
I'll shine a light for you
Somewhere in the night
I'll be standing by
I will be here for you

I will be here for you
Somewhere in the night
Somewhere in the night
I'll shine a light for you
Somewhere in the night
I'll be standing by
I will be here for you

I will be here for you

So many memories and so many miles
The road that stretches behind us
We've had some laughter and our share 
Of tears
But all these moments unite us

I'll be your friend for a lifetime
Against the wind and the rain of every season
Won't walk away in the hard times
I will be your friend
I'm saying I will be your friend

Sure as the river runs to the sea
High as the mountain that reaches
You were there by my side till the end
 helped me on my feet again

So in the valley walk on
Don't have to face it alone
Cause in the hard times 
We keep growing strong
As we learn, as we live
That we live when we give

Sometimes I wonder if my beating heart has a reason
The thought of breathing only takes my breath away
I've spent so many nights wrestling with this feeling
Do I have the strength to make it through the day
But I was never meant
To walk this road alone
I can always trust you
When you say

I will carry you
Be your strength
And pull you through
Reach for me
And take my hand
We will pray
And we will stand
In a world
Crying out for peace
Let your heart be strong
For when I am weak
You will carry me

Sometimes you wonder if the road you're on has a reason
It's hard to go on when you just don't know
We can shoulder all the weight of life between us
Until the fear of what we cannot see is gone
Cause we were never meant
To walk this road alone
We are bound together
When we say

I will carry you
Be your strength
And pull you through
Reach for me
And take my hand
We will pray
And we will stand
In a world
Crying out for peace
Let your heart be strong
For when I am weak
You will carry me

I will carry you
Be your strength
And pull you through
In a world
Crying out for peace
Let your heart be strong
For when I am weak
You will carry me

I will carry you
Be your strength
And pull you through
In a world
Crying out for peace
Let your heart be strong
For when I am weak
You will carry me

And I will carry you
Please know, I will carry you

Hey boy - did you find out
Whatcha had to know - 'n what it's all about
When you started to move - just a step at a time
You never wanted to fall
You took a chance on the wild side
Hey, girl - can'tcha come down
Are ya way at the top - afraid of somethin' you found
Then you try to go back - not as easy to do
Did you find who you are
From a dance on the wild side

I know sometimes it's hard for you
To keep your feet upon the path that you've chosen
It's not for you to walk alone
Together we can take this road where it's going - hang on

Stand by me - stand right here
The time has come to say it clear
Now don't give up - but don't give in
We will stand together to the end
And I'll be around - I'll be around, yeah

No joke - the sooner you find
It happens all the same - for every mother's child
when you walk in the dark - then you stumble and fall
It's a part of it all
When we dance on the wild side

But everybody needs someone
Who loves 'em through the toughest times - while they're growing - yah
Who keeps a candle burning
When the darkness covers up the path where they're going - hang on

Stand by me - stand right here
The time has come to say it clear
Now don't give up - don't give in
We will stand together to the end
And I'll be around - come what may
Heaven hears us when we pray
So don't give up - but don't give in
We will stand together to the end
I will be there, my good friend
And I'll be around

Be around, I'll be around...
I'll walk this road with you
wherever it may wind
And I'll be around

Wandering the road of desperate life
Aimlessly beneath a barren sky
Leave it to me
I'll lead you home

So afraid that you will not be found
It won't be long before your sun goes down
Just leave it to me
I'll lead you home

Hear me calling
Hear me calling
Just leave it to me
I'll lead you home

A troubled mind and a doubter's heart
You wonder how you ever got this far
Leave it to me
I'll lead you home

Vultures of darkness ate the crumbs you left
You got no way to retrace your steps
Just leave it to me
I'll lead you home

Hear me calling
Hear me calling
You're lost and alone
Leave it to me
I'll lead you home

So let it go and turn it over to
The one who chose to give his life for you
Leave it to me
I'll lead you home

Hear me calling
Hear me calling
You're lost and alone
Leave it to me
I'll lead you home

Morning mystery pull me
Give me one more week and I'll be gone
It's been a long hard month of Sundays
Still no rain
Nothing left around here 
But the dust and shame
I know you know 
I know you know

And I'm trying to find a way, 
To hold onto my faith
While I wait, for You
I'll wait for You

Now I lie awake at night
Trying hard to think, that these 
Are the hardest times I've ever seen
I'm still holding on

I know You never said it'd be easy
All thick and no thin
But the man who waits, is the man who wins
I'm holding on, 
I'm holding on

But I hide myself away, and I hide myself away
And I'll wait for You, I'll wait for You
I'll wait for You, I'll wait for You

I need You now 
I need You now, 
Lord I need You now 

And I'll wait for You, I'll wait for You
I'm gonna wait for You, oh I wait for You,

I'm gonna walk on, and not get weary, now
I'm gonna run, and not fall down
I know that someday I'll get my wits about

You will carry me, 
You will carry me

I'm gonna rise up, like an eagle, now
Gonna ride that big blue sky,

I'm sure that someday, 
Won't look down again

You will carry me
You will carry me, even now 
 
Carry me, even now, 

You will carry me, 
You will carry me

Even now, oh carry me 

I see you smiling at me
And I fall into a daydream
Don't know what all of this means
Oh, is it love?
Logic is slipping away
My heart's on a runaway train 

I'm gone, yes I'm gone, yes I'm gone and
It feels so right 

Each time I look in your eyes
So glad you came into my life
Much more than an emotional high
Oh, this is love
I know that I've made up my mind
I'll stay for the rest of my life

I am holding to the joy of my salvation
I am glad to have a life that always grows
And if the Word of God is any indication
I am doing even better than I know
I am doing even better than I know
There's a joy that even people of the world find
In every good and perfect gift the Father sends
So I thank the Lord that I was born the first time
But I thank Him more that I was born again
Oh, I thank Him more that I was born again

Chorus:
I am up
Like the sun is up
I can feel my life on a rise
I am up
Like the stars at night
I get up on bein' alive
I am up
Like the Lord is up
And my life is filled with His life
I was freed and I am saved
I am up
I am up

There are times life is so fine I can't contain it
Everywhere I look I see what God had done
And I don't have to work and worry to sustain it
When I walk with God His joy will always come
When I walk with God His joy will always come

I walked this road
So very long ago
To show the way
So you would know
I walked the road
With holes in my hands in feet
To make the way
Come follow me

No, you are not alone
You will be free indeed
The journey begins and ends
With me
One million miles
It starts with a step or two
What are you waiting for?
I'm waiting for you

You run the race
Thinking you've almost won
Then you may find
You've only begun

You're on the road
Thinking you're far from here
And suddenly find
You're very near

I really want to see you
I really want to touch you
If only I could hold you in my arms again
I really want to reach you
Forever to be with you
If only I could hold you in my arms again

It was written in the stars
On the pages of my heart
Oh, that someday I would find
The love I feel for you tonight

On the ocean of our dreams
Like a prayer you came to me
And the longing that had been
Found its ending in your eyes
And I am missing you tonight

I really want to see you
I really want to touch you
If only I could hold you in my arms again
I really want to reach you
Forever to be with you
If only I could hold you in my arms again

Across the waves, across the sea
Separating you from me
Here's a promise and it's mine
I will love you for all time
I'm wishing you were here tonight

I really want to see you
I really want to touch you
If only I could hold you in my arms again
I really want to reach you
Forever to be with you
If only I could hold you in my arms again

On the stairs she sits and waits
She's crying out but nobody even cares

Holding in the hurt and pain
Looking for love to come pull her from this place

I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence
I'm not gonna walk away in silence

Sometimes we're loudest when
The doors are shut and no one can see our face

But it seems we're quiet when
Someone needs a touch of heaven's grace, oh yeah

I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence
I'm not gonna walk away in silence

We are all God's children
We need to count off all we've been given, oh yeah
We are all God's children
We need to tell off all we've been given, oh yeah, oh yeah

I'm not gonna sit and stay
I'm not gonna walk away

I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence
I'm not gonna walk away in silence, yeah, in silence
I'm not gonna walk away in silence

Joyful, joyful we adore Thee,
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before thee
Opening to the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness,
Drive the dark of doubt away,
Giver of immortal gladness,
Fill us with the light of day.

All Thy works with joy surround Thee,
Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays,
Stars and angels sing around Thee,
Center of unbroken praise.
Field and forest, vale and mountain,
Flowery meadow, flashing sea,
Chanting bird and flowing fountain,
Call us to rejoice in Thee.

Mortals, join the happy chorus
Which the morning stars began
Father love is reigning o'er us,
Brother love binds man to man.
Ever singing, march we onward,
Victors in the midst of strife,
Joyful music leads us sun-ward
In the triumph song of life.

Joyful of joyful
Lord we adore Thee
The God of glory
The Lord of love

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer, on Vixen
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner, on Blitzen
Put on your bells, your Christmas bells

Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride
Christmas time is here again
Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride
To spread good cheer again
From the top of the chimney to the top of the wall
Dash away, dash away, dash away all

Old Saint Nicholas, he took a flight
The moon was shining bright
Bring out the bells
Ol' Saint Nick was riding through the sky
You should have seen those reindeer fly

Bring out the bells, it's a holiday season
Bring out the bells, it's a happy time
Bring out the bells, we've got a good reason
To ring the bells and hear those pretty bells chime

Sun comes up Sunday morn 
On the little church where I been since I was born 
And there he stood a hearty smile 
You could hear his voice ringing out for a country mile 

And he could place your mind at ease 
With his tenderness and a heart 
That aimed to please 
A pauper's hands a farmer's clothes 
Just a preacher man we called Kentucky Rose 

He worked the soul like he worked the land 
He spoke in ways that anyone could understand 
Simple words of simple faith 
And when it came to love 
He would go out of his way 

A helping hand 
A soothing chat 
And he practiced what he preached imagine that 
And as far as kindness goes 
There was none compared to old Kentucky Rose 

Evening stroll 'cross Shyler's bridge 
That's when he saw the boy 
Trapped below that rocky ridge 
He knew the danger he would face 
But it's as if he saved the child 
Only to take his place 

For on that ridge of stone and ice 
Kentucky met his maker in a sacrifice 
Why he's gone 
God only knows 
Maybe for the company of his Kentucky Rose 

So peaceful in his Sunday best 
He was buried on a hill and laid to rest 
When people heard they came in droves 
To say their last good-byes to sweet Kentucky Rose 

Now, on that hill 
One flower grows 
They say it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose
They say it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose 
I believe it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose

Here we are on a boat out on the sea
Off the coast of Africa
Heading for peaceful shores
With a cast of strangers
To an island hideaway
I hear you telling me
Of the place we soon will be
A rebirth from life's demise
Where the world is still, it's ideal
Anything you dream is real
It's Hotel Paradise
And you say it's nice 

Lamu, far away
Leave the pain far behind you
Hoping it won't find you
Lamu, far away
You say it's there that you can run
From the one inside of you

So here we are on an island in the sea
Near the coast of Africa
And when it's right, Lamu nights
They can be so inviting
Heaven here on earth
But here on earth
But I hear you telling
This is everything you need
Well, I don't think it's true
'Cause the way you feel isn't real
You attempt to try and fill
The void that's digging thru
And it's killing you 

Lamu, far away
Leave the pain far behind you
Hoping it won't find you
Lamu, far away
You say it's there that you can run
From the one inside of you

Daddy's on the sofa, turning up another bottle to unleash when I get home
I pretend he doesn't hit me
Momma just pretends that she don't know.

I used to think of talking
Talking to my preacher
He says I should just forgive and forget.
Now my baby brother just sits and recollects the same regrets.

And I just wanna leave
Oh, God, please help me now, I wanna leave.

As if that's not enough
We're the new family around here
Guess that's all the reason some kids need
'Cause they all call me names, and say I should just take it on the chin.

If I'm overreacting, then why is it so cold here
Why is it so cold here, in this hell
Why would my friend Suzy
Tell me I should just go kill myself?

And I just wanna leave
Oh, God, please help me now, I wanna leave
And I, I just wanna leave
Oh, God, please help me now, I wanna leave

Oh, I wanna get out of here
Oh, God, help me now, I really wanna leave,

And I, just wanna leave
Oh, God, please help me now, I wanna leave
Oh, but I, I just wanna believe
Oh, God, please hear me now, I wanna believe
I just need to know, that You're really out there
Tell me if You're really out there, 'cause I believe.

I'm looking at you, old friend of mine
There's no use pretending that everything's fine
Now don't be so brave, don't be so proud
I want you to know that I'm here for you now

I can see you hurting and it's hurting me
It doesn't have to be this way

If you let me hold you closer

Let me know you

Let me show you the way

I'm feeling for you, feeling so much
When this heart is big enough for the both of us
I'll give you my love if you give me your pain
I'll hold it inside of me 'till you're stronger again

Well, I hate seeing you so far away
When not a word can say it enough

I'll be your rock for this day
When I hear you calling out my name
Cause I know you'd only do the same for me

I cannot follow you, my love,
You cannot follow me.
I am the distance you put between
All of the moments that we will be.

You know who I am,
You've stared at the sun,
Well I am the one who loves
Changing from nothing to one.

Sometimes I need you naked,
Sometimes I need you wild,
I need you to carry my children in
And I need you to kill a child.

You know who I am

If you should ever track me down
I will surrender there
And I will leave with you one broken man
Whom I will teach you to repair.

You know who I am

I cannot follow you, my love,
You cannot follow me.
I am the distance you put between
All of the moments that we will be.

You know who I am

Never should have tasted that forbidden fruit
Tell me why do I always do
What I don't want to do
Now, I'm the only reaper of the seeds that I sow
And when I walk the field of my stubborn will
It's a hard row to hoe
There's a price for getting smarter
So I pay what I owe
While bridges burn
Let the shadow fall behind me
I am wiser I know
We live and learn
Always living and learning
Always living and learning
Is it out of the fire, back in to the pan
Is once enough to let it all sink in-or will I do it again
A time for understanding has now come of age
So I heed the word of the counselor and the voice of the sage
Try to see the meaning
Read between every line
When pages turn
There'll be no room for explaining what has been well-defined
We live and learn
Always living and learning
Always living and learning

An engaging temptation had me doing time
Cause when it starts a fire under strong desire
We are partners in crime
But hindsight is clearer
I can where I've gone and never return
It's a new man in the mirror
It's a new freedom song to live and learn
Always living and learning
Always living and learning

You painted me a picture of tomorrow
A place where you and I walked hand in hand
A world without despair and without shadows
But things just didn't turn out how we'd planned
Now you're gone

And I believe that there is somewhere
Where the angels fill the sky
And I believe we'll live forever
You and I, you and I
Will never die

I wonder if you knew that you were leaving
I thought that I saw something in your eyes
You painted me a picture of believing
I'll see you there on the other side
And I'll be there

You painted me a picture of tomorrow
A place where you and I walked hand in hand
A world without despair and without shadows
But things just didn't turn out how we'd planned
Now you're gone

And I believe that there is somewhere
Where the angels fill the sky
And I believe we'll live forever
You and I, you and I
Will never die

I wonder if you knew that you were leaving
I thought that I saw something in your eyes
You painted me a picture of believing
I'll see you there on the other side
And I'll be there

Preach the Gospel to all the world, 
And if necessary, use words. St. Francis of Assisi

We're passengers aboard the train
Silent little lambs amidst the pain
That's no longer good enough
And when it's time to speak our faith
We use a language no one can explain
That's no longer good enough

And God knows it's a shame
As we look to pass the flame
We are not the worthy bearers of his name

For the world to know the truth
There can be no greater proof
Than to live the life, live the life
There's no love that's quite as pure
There's no pain we can't endure
If we live the life, live the life
Be a light for all to see
For every act of love will set you free

There's something beautiful and bold
The power of a million human souls
Come together as one
And each in turn goes out to lead
Another by his word, his love, his deed
Now the circle is done

It all comes back to One
For it is He and He alone
Who has lived the only perfect life we've known

Jesus, I've forgotten the words that you have spoken
Promises that burned within my heart have now grown dim
With a doubting heart I follow the paths of earthly wisdom
Forgive me for my unbelief
Renew the fire again

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy 
Lord have mercy on me

I have built an altar where I worship things of god
I have taken journeys that have drawn me far from you
Now I am returning to your mercies ever flowing
Pardon my transgressions
Help me love you again

I have longed to know you and your tender mercies
Like a river of forgiveness ever flowing without end
I bow my heart before you in the goodness of your presence
Your grace forever shining
Like a beacon in the night

Jesus, I've forgotten the words that you have spoken
Promises that burned within my heart have now grown dim
With a doubting heart I follow the paths of earthly wisdom
Forgive me for my unbelief
Renew the fire again

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy 
Lord have mercy on me

I have built an altar where I worship things of god
I have taken journeys that have drawn me far from you
Now I am returning to your mercies ever flowing
Pardon my transgressions
Help me love you again

I have longed to know you and your tender mercies
Like a river of forgiveness ever flowing without end
I bow my heart before you in the goodness of your presence
Your grace forever shining
Like a beacon in the night

Brother, haven't you noticed
There's a war on the soul of man
Hey there, sister
The world is reaching
It could use a helping hand
So come on
No dues are needed
Just a kind heart will be enough
There's a hunger
But you can feed it
Sign the card and join the club

We are drawing from an ancient solution
We're embarking on a new regime
We are calling for a new revolution
Be part of the parade
Get on the Love Crusade

Jesus said love your neighbor
Like you would love yourself
Get together
Do Him a favor
Give your love to someone else

Just a little sets the wheels in motion
A little more and we could change the world
You can shine a light if you have the notion
So get out of the shade
Get on the Love Crusade

Na na na na

Come on everyone
There's a lot that can be done
A little love can go a long, long way
So rise to the occasion
Of a radical invasion
 Don't let the world go down in flames
Fight the fire with a fire
Push it to the limit
And be a renegade
Light a fuse-make a spark
Try to penetrate a heart
There's a burning need to fill the world with love
Love is kind, love is sound
It makes the world go round
So it keep it turning
There could never be enough
Hatred'll spoil the feast
That's the nature of the beast
So don't ever let your heart be swayed
Draw the sword, slay the dragon
Get on the bandwagon
And be a fighter on the Love Crusade

We are drawing from an ancient solution
We're embarking on a new regime
We are calling for a new revolution
Be part of the parade

Darkness thick and heavy
Black and steady screaming darkness
Anyone who hates his brother
Who plans evil for another
Walks in darkness
Sonlight, warm and shining
Purifying, welcome Sonlight
Everyone who loves completely
With a heart that opens freely
Walks in Sonlight

Let us love in the light
For love is from God
If we love what is right
We show whose we are
In a world of the dying
We're living our parts
If we love in the light
With all of our hearts

Blindness, terrifying, 
Left for dying, spirit blindness
Anyone who thirsts for evil plots
His very own upheaval
Lost in blindness
New sight, truth unending 
Faith unbending, new sight
Everyone who seeks 
The father leaves the world
And all its bother
Sees with new sight

Let us love in the light
For love is from God
If we love what is right
We show whose we are
In a world of the dying
We're living our parts
If we love in the light
With all of our hearts

Sometimes I feel like this world
Is just one big gigantic merry-go-round
You gotta hold on tight or you get hurled through the air
Yeah, life is a three-ring circus
With clowns and freaks and camels and such
And you never know when you might be attacked by the bears

Give me love, give me love, love me good
Sometimes I feel like
I'm afraid of my own shadow and then
Sometimes I can feel as bold as Genghis Khan
But I could never live in a yurt
On a diet of Mongolian barbecue
I conquer the world for a moment, then the moment is gone

Chorus

Bridge:

Let us take a moment now to bow our heads and pray
If only to give thanks for making it through another day

Sometimes I wish I was in a movie
Or some 70's TV thing
Where everything gets neatly wrapped by the end of the show
Yeah, but this ain't Hollywood
And this sure ain't the Brady Bunch
And how this plot's gonna all pan out, I don't really know

Chorus

My Jesus I love Thee, I know Thou art mine
For Thee all the follies of sin I resign
My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now

I love Thee because Thou has first loved me
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow
If ever I loved Thee my Jesus 'tis now

I'll love Thee in life and I will love Thee in death
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath
And say when the death dew lies cold on my brow
If ever I loved Thee my Jesus 'tis now

I love You Jesus
I'll always love You
Now and forever
I belong to You

In mansions of glory and endless delight
I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow
If ever I loved Thee my Jesus 'tis now

I love You Jesus
I'll always love You
Now and forever
I belong to You

I love You Jesus
I'll always love You
Now and forever
I belong to You
I belong to You
I belong to You

Lift Jesus higher
Lift Jesus higher
Lift Jesus higher
Lift Jesus higher
Lift Jesus higher
Lift Jesus higher
Lift Jesus higher

I had a dream that I was speaking
With a prophet from the land of wise
In a crowd of people from the land of troubled hearts
I said we've come here for answers
A solution to our world's demise
He said the journey would be long
But here's where you start

Love one another
Love one another
Work it in to work it out
There could never be enough
Love one another
Love one another
Cause you know without a doubt
You can change your world with love

It was a simple conclusion
But I thought that it was rather profound
Just a fundamental law that we should all live by
I took it in to tomorrow
Yea, I walked the earth but I never found
Any corner of the world
Where this did not apply

Love one another
Love one another
Work it in to work it out
There could never be enough
Love one another
Love one another
Cause you know without a doubt
You can change your world with love

And looking out I saw no method to the madness there
Like in a vision from the Isle of Patmos, I was scared
It was a revelation
Love is getting rare

The people of the land united
And in my dream we all agreed
That we should start again
And this would be our creed

Love one another
Love one another
Work it in to work it out
There could never be enough
Love one another
Love one another
Cause you know without a doubt
You can change your world with love

Lux venit lux venit
Lux venit sursum corda
Lux venit lux venit arise
Shine for your light has come
By sword by flame
In death solemn ages passed
And voices young
Grow old weary
Holding fast
Hope for the dawning

Lux venit lux venit
Lux venit sursum corda
Lux venit lux venit arise
Shine for your light has come

In grace in might
The babe lay in stable stark
Redemptions's light
Pierces through the shadows dark
Alleluia

Lux venit lux venit
Sursum corda
Lux venit lux venit arise
Shine for your light has come

Lux venit lux venit
Lux venit sursum corda
Lux venit lux venit arise
Shine for your light has come

Alleluia

Singin' Majesty, Majesty

Forever, forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your Majesty

Your grace, Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed but alive in Your hands

We praise You, lift up a new song
Oh we praise You Lord, we bless Your name
You are the Father, You are the Father
Oh, we love You, we love You, we love You, oh oh
Oh, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

If I could, I would tell you why
The first time I saw her I could touch the sky
I turned to stone, and I could not speak
She had the ability to make me weep

Always wishing, always hoping
That she'll get the message from the bottom of my heart
Let's together share forever
It's just a matter of time

I had to wait and just let her breathe
That's never been easy for a man to see
She moved slow and she took her time
She kept me guessing what was on her mind

Always wishing, always hoping
That you'd get the message from the bottom of my heart
Let's forever be together
It's just a matter of time

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the sky looking down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay

Child in the manger, Infant of Mary
Outcast and stranger, Lord of all
Child who inherits
All our transgressions
All our demerits on Him fall

Once the most holy
Child of salvation
Gentle and lowly
Now as our glorious Mighty Redeemer
See Him victorious
O'er each foe

Prophets fortold Him
Infant of wonder
Angels behold Him On His throne
Worthy our Savior
Of all our praises
Happy forever
Are His own

Joy to the world
The Lord has come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart
Prepare him room

And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
and Heaven, and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the earth
The Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ

While fields and floods
Rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

He rules the world
With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness

And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love

Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Of the Lord and Savior
We the tidings tell
Sing we Noel
For Christ the King is born
Sing we Noel
For Christ the Lord is born
Angels from on high
May shepherds come and see
He's born in Bethlehem
A blessed family
Glory to God
For Christ our King is born
Glory to God
For Christ our Lord is born
Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Sing we now of Christmas
Sing we all Noel
Sing we all Noel
Sing we all Noel

Good King Wenceslaus looked out on the feast of Stephen.
When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even.
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel,
When a poor man came in sight, gathering winter fuel. 

Hither page and stand by me if thou know'st it telling
Yonder peasant, who is he, where and what his dwelling?
Sire, he lives a good league hence, underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence, by Saint Agnes' fountain. 

Bring me flesh and bring me wine, bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I will see him dine when we bear them thither
Page and monarch forth they went, forth they went together
Through the rude winds wild lament, and the bitter weather. 

Sire the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how, I can go no longer.
Mark my footsteps my good page, tread thou in them boldly
Thou shalt find the winter's rage freeze thy blood less coldly. 

In his master's steps he trod where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod which the saint had printed
Therefore Christian men be sure, wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing.

Still searching for that boy who had the faith to move a mountain. 
Want the fire back.

Another question in me
One for the powers that be
It's got me thrown and so
I Put on my poker face
And try to figure it out
This undeniable doubt
A common occurrence
Feeling so out of place

Guarded and cynical now
Can't help but wondering how
My heart evolved into a
Rock beating inside of me
So I reel, such a stoic ordeal
Where's that feeling that I don't feel?

There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain
And like a child he would believe without a reason
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and
I've been searching for that missing person

Under a lavender moon
So many thoughts consume me
Who dimmed that glowing light
That once burned so bright in me
Is this a radical phase
A problematical age
That keeps me running
From all that I used to be

Is there a way to return
Is there a way to unlearn
That carnal knowledge
That's chipping away at my soul
I've been gone too long
Will I ever find my way home?

There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain
And like a child he would believe without a reason
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and
I've been searching for that missing person
He used to want to try to walk the straight and narrow
He had a fire and he could feel it in the marrow
It's been a long time and I haven't seen him lately but
I've been searching for that missing person

I am only human
Struggling to find
Confidence in all that I believe
You are only holy
You are love defined
And you have said to ask and I'll receive
So I have come to pray
That you will come and fill
The hunger here inside me to grow
Stronger in the faith
There's a longing and a need
To have you ever closer
Come fill me
Cause when you move in me
It's like a symphony
The timeless melody 
That soothes my soul
Though silent I can tell
That you're alive and well
Cause I can feel you move
In me
What they try to tell me 
Is that your love is falseWhat they try to tell me
Is that Your is false
And faith is just a way
I choose to feel
And that there was no meaning
To You upon the cross
And I should reach for something that is real
And when those words are said
The questions in me start
And I don't have any answers
Until I stop thinking with my head
And start listening to my heart
And there I find my assurance
I tell them
Chorus

I have been unfaithful
I have been unworthy
I have been unrighteous
And I have been unmerciful

I have been unreachable
I have been unteachable
I have been unwilling
And I have been undesirable

Sometimes, I have been unwise
I've been undone by what I'm unsure of
But because of you, and all that you went through
I know that I have never been unloved

I have been unbroken
I have been unmended
I have been uneasy
And I've been unapproachable

I've been unemotional
I've been unexceptional
I've been undecided
And I have been unqualified

Unaware, I have been unfair
I've been unfit for blessings from above
But even I can see the sacrifice you made for me
To show that I have never been unloved

No eye had seen
No ear had heard
'Til hosts on high
Proclaimed the birth
And heaven brought down

Its only child

The son of man

The world reconciled

And song broke forth
Angelic strain
And none could help
But sing the name

Emmanuel

Emmanuel

Emmanuel

Emmanuel

Woa-o-woa-oah-Woa-o-woa-oah
Woa-o-woa-oah-Woa-o-woa-oah
Woa-o-woa-oah-Woa-o-woa-oah
Woa-o-woa-oah-Woa-o-woa-oah
What can wash away my sins
 Nothing but the blood of Jesus

What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

This is all my righteousness
It's nothing but the blood of Jesus

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh Lord, You're beautiful
Your face is all I seek
For when Your eyes are on this child
Your grace abounds to me, yeah

Oh Lord, You're beautiful
Your face is all I seek
For when Your eyes are on this child
Your grace abounds to me

For when Your eyes are on this child
Your grace abounds to me, oh Lord
Oh Lord, You're beautiful, yes You are, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord, You're beautiful, yes You are
Lord, You're beautiful

In the passion your heart is abused 
He is pushing you, you have to choose 
Oh, Rebecca, love is never 
Easy anymore 
Oh, Rebecca, so afraid of 
Losing what is yours 

Are you giving in to the pressure 
Holding you again, now he tells you 
What it takes to be in love 
He believes you're old enough 
But how you gonna feel tomorrow 
When the day reveals 
What you believed was for the sake of love 
Don't you think you're old enough to know 

You're a breed of few and far between 
Holding on to your romantic dream 
Oh, Rebecca, love is patient 
Love would understand 
Oh, Rebecca, your decision 
Is your only chance 

Are you giving in to the pressure 
Holding you again, now he tells you 
What it takes to be in love 
He believes you're old enough 
But how you gonna feel tomorrow 
When the day reveals 
What you believed was for the sake of love 
Don't you think you're old enough to know 

Oh, Rebecca don't confuse what love is 
With what some say love should be 
Should be

I'm not how I used to be
When we hung around
Back when it was you and me
Tearin' up this town
We used to live our lives running from change
Now we don't see eye to eye
I am not the same

And you wonder where I've gone
Well, I've found where I belong
I'm on the other side
True, I used to walk your shore
But I'm not there anymore
I'm on the other side

Years fade like the setting sun
Turning us loose
They give us many ways to run
And many roads to choose
Well, I ran into saving grace
Headed for nowhere
Love showed me another place
And brought me there

Why is it hard for you to see
All the changes made in me
Here on the other side
Oh, I could help you understand
And you could join me where I am
I am on the other side

There always seems to be a door that you can't open
There always seems to be a mountain you can't climb
But you keep on reaching
You just keep on reaching

When your destiny is out there in the distance
But the road ahead's a mine field in disguise
And you keep on moving
You just keep on moving

You will make it through this
Just give it time
You gotta give it time

This is what you're made for
Standing in the downpour
Knowing that the sun will shine
Forget what lies behind you

Heaven walks beside you
You got to give it one more try
One more time

You just keep on reaching
You just keep on, you keep on moving

When the shadows fall on everything you're dreaming
When the promises turn out to be a lie
You just keep believing
You just keep believing
Oh, don't stop your dreaming
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
You've got to keep on reaching
Keep believing
It's gonna be alright

Many people in the steeple
But no one leaves the walls
Quick to stand and speak all of their beliefs
Quick to leave you if you fall

Tell me where's the love
It knows no boundaries
Tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah
Open arms, we need to be open arms

Never judge You, always loving
Needs to be what we become
Lifting up the lost, showing them the cross
Shining brightly like the sun

Tell me where's the love
It knows no boundaries
Tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah
Open arms, we need to be open arms, yeah

Tell me where's the love
It knows no boundaries
Tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah
Open arms, we need to be open arms, oh yeah
And everybody sing

Open arms, we need to be open arms
And the whole world sing
Open arms, we need to be open arms

Take stock of your life
What's wrong and what's right
Empty pockets, got no green
Don't you know sunshine is free
What breaks have you had
Some good and some bad
Want to go but got no car
Dreaming dreams can take you far

You will find that life's worth living
In this world, it's out of this world
With a little love and a little giving
In this world, it's out of this world

Look to the future
Who's in the picture
Say your love life's just a dream
Still you've got a friend in me

Today, tomorrow
Laughter and sorrow
Gonna be some lows and highs
Might as well enjoy the ride

You will find that life's worth living
In this world, it's out of this world
With a little love and a little giving
In this world, it's out of this world

Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
O sing all ye citizens of heav'n above
Glory to God
Glory in the highest

O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Yea Lord we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus to Thee be all glory giv'n
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing

O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

Pull all your hair up 
Dab on the make up 
Tryin' hard to look so pristine 
Like a face in a magazine 
Those fancy dressers 
And media pressure 
Got you feeling so plain and small 
If you don't look like a paper doll 

In a world where the goal is 
To be like the Joneses 
It's guaranteed to drive you wild 
Keeping up with the latest style 
Gaze in the mirror 
You want the glamour 
And the grace of a movie star 
But I like you the way you are 
You are the only one I'm dreamin' of 
'Cause baby don't you know that I Love 

You, girl 
You don't have to be picture perfect 
To be in my world 
Girl 
You don't have to be picture perfect 
To fit the frame 

You're tender you're tactful 
Girl you're a natural 
You possess a heart that's true 
That's what I like about you 
One in a million 
Yeah that's a given 
There's a beauty inside of you 
And it shows on the outside too 
No competition you're way in the lead 
And baby don't you know that I need 

You, girl 
You don't have to be picture perfect 
To be in my world 
Girl 
You don't have to be picture perfect 
To fit the frame

The wind is moving
But I am standing still
A life of pages
Waiting to be filled
A heart that's hopeful
A head that's full of dreams
But this becoming
Is harder than it seems
Feels like I'm

Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world

If there are millions
Down on their knees
Among the many
Can you still hear me?
Hear me asking
Where do I belong?
Is there a vision
That I can call my own?
Show me I'm

Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world

Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need Your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world

Looking for a reason
Roaming through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world

Here is where the road divides
Here is where we realize
The sculpting of the Father's great design
Through' time you've been a friend to me
But time is now the enemy
I wish we didn't have to say goodbye
But I know the road He chose for me
Is not the road he chose for you
So as we chase the dreams we're after

Pray for me and I'll pray for you
Pray that we will keep the common ground
Won't you pray for me and I'll pray for you
And one day love will bring us back around again

Painted on our tapestry
We see the way it has to be
Weaving through' the laughter and the tears
But love will be the tie that binds us
To the time we leave behind us
Memories will be our souvenirs
And I know that through' it all
The hardest part of love is letting go
But there's a greater love that holds us

Pray for me and I'll pray for you
Pray that we will keep the common ground
Won't you pray for me and I'll pray for you
And one day love will bring us back around again

Prepare ye the way
Prepare ye the way of the Lord
Prepare ye the way
Prepare ye the way of the Lord

Yeshua You reign on High
You reign on High
Almighty God
Your Love is like no other
Yeshua You reign on high
Almighty God
Your love is like no other

One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come here to justify
One man to overthrow
In the name of love!
One man in the name of love
In the name of love!
What more? In the name of love!

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resists
One man washed on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss

In the name of love!
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love!
What more? In the name of love!

Nobody like you
There's nobody like you

Mm mm mm
Early morning, April 4
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride

In the name of love!
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love!
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love!
What more in the name of love

Where the angels see
You are praised as You should be.
But how can I express
My yearning for Your Holiness.
May it be 

I will open my heart
Search me in the deepest part.
And I will stand in cleansing fire,
By You, purified,
By You I'm purified.

Savior of my soul
To your strength I yield control.
Purge me of my stain
Sin will lose it's mortal reign.
Make me free 

You are Holy
You are Holy
Yes You are Holy
You are Holy
You are Holy
Holy

You are Holy
You are Holy
Yes You are Holy
You are Holy
You are Holy
Holy

Where the angels see
You are praised as You should be.
But how can I express
My yearning for Your Holiness.
May it be 

I will open my heart
Search me in the deepest part.
And I will stand in cleansing fire,
By You, purified,
By You I'm purified.

Savior of my soul
To your strength I yield control.
Purge me of my stain
Sin will lose it's mortal reign.
Make me free 

You are Holy

Wake up and dream about
The plans you have in store for you
But keep in mind
It's not just what you do
But what you do it for-and who
There are roads to discover
There are stories yet to be told
As you see the big picture
Just beginning to unfold 

Break down the barriers but
Don't bend the rules
Never forget your roots
As you head for something new
Ride through the shades of desire
Letting the light be seen
And he'll steer the heart in the
Pursuit of the dream

It's alright to find yourself
Thinking now and then
About the way you want your life to be
Anticipating what lies
Just around the bend
Can't wait to see

Comes the time of decision
Some you dodge and some you should face
As you see the big picture
There will be some dues to pay 

Break down the barriers but
Don't bend the rules
Never forget your roots
As you head for something new
Ride through the shades of desire
Letting the light be seen
And he'll steer the heart in the
Pursuit of the dream

Wake up and dream about
The plans you have in store for you
But keep in mind
It's not just what you do
But what you do it for-and who

There are choices that build you
Choices that will make you fall
All part of the big picture
One day you will see it all

Break down the barriers but
Don't bend the rules
Never forget your roots
As you head for something new
Ride through the shades of desire
Letting the light be seen
And he'll steer the heart in the
Pursuit of the dream

Sometimes the journey makes you weary
Feels like a long and winding road
Sometimes this life can lose it's meaning
But you might be surprised to find some hope
Maybe you're wondering where love is
You may fell it's far away from here
Maybe you're wondering where I am
You might be surprised to find I'm near

And when your life is tossed and turning
And you are on the raging sea
I'll come and pull you from the water
Then you will know that you are free

So if you're stumbling through the valley
Or if you're tempted to give up the fight
Reach out your hand and I will lead you
I will be your strong arm in the night

Another million miles from the Truth now
I know there's peace but I can't seem
To figure out how
To stop this race that's taking over me
I'm under the gun I wait for You to see

Oh, please reach out to me
Open my eyes to see
I'm running from you now
Come rescue me somehow

Another scar from fighting the Truth now
Has left me like a stranger to my need now
A masquerade, a game to figure out now
A cruel charade I cannot scream aloud

A narrow stretch of road in the way now
A heavy load still hanging on to me now
I'm in a maze that I can't seem to get out
Without a view from these shoulders of doubt

Another million miles from the truth now
I know there's peace but I can't
Figure out how
To stop this race that's taking over me
I'm under the gun I wait for you to see

Oh, please reach out to me
Open my eyes to see
I'm running from you now
Come rescue me somehow

Another scar from fighting the truth now
Has left me like a stranger to my need now
A masquerade, a game to figure out now
A cruel charade I cannot scream aloud

A narrow stretch of road in the way now
A heavy load still hanging on to me now
I'm in a maze that I can't seem to get out
Without a view from these shoulders of doubt

On the street it never changes
There's a chill in the air
Icy people, empty faces
Not a word, not a soul who cares
Do you give up
Have you given in to the lie that a heart never changes
Don't be fooled by what you see there
Another man with another case of
Chorus:
One restless heart
Who never could find love
Too many hurts
To reach out again
How can he know
Love still wants to find him
One restless shell of a man

Don't look away
In a moment his life could be new
Just a moment and love could break through
Oh finally some place to start
For a man with a restless heart

Why the fear then, why the worry
Why the walls holding love inside
When you're needed in the fury
In the fighting to save men's lives
Don't you give up
Don't be giving in to the lie that a heart never changes
If you reach out God'll reach in
Bring an end to another case of

Chorus

One restless heart, one restless heart
One restless heart, one restless heart
He's got to know that love still can find him
Love can reach any man

Don't look away
In a moment his life could be new
Just a moment and love could break through
Oh finally some place to start
For a man with a restless heart

Tag:
Don't you look away
Oh never a stranger again
Love has saved a restless man
Finally some place to start
For a man with a restless heart

Tag

Walk across the shore
Walk across the sea
Stand upon the waves
And walk with me
Journey through the door
Come see what I can see
All the reasons we were made
Who we were meant to be

Rise, He's calling you to go
Just leave it all behind
And rise above

Beyond the obvious
And what you can attain
Past the here and now
Where faith remains
Lift your weary head
There's too much left to lose
More than you can imagine
It's waiting there for you

Rise, He's calling you to come
Just leave it all behind
And rise above

Come and stand
And join with me as one
Now take my hand and we
Will rise above

     

Rise, He's calling you to come
Just leave it all behind
And rise above
Come and stand
And join with me as one
Now take my hand and we
Will rise above

  
Come stand with me
  
Come stand with me

A Friday night affair
Out in the city heat
Always a party there
Along the sordid street
And it was guaranteed
The place to be was Rocketown
The drinks were two for one
Inside the crowded bars
The girls would make their run
Out on the boulevard
It was the idol place
We lived the ways of Rocketown
Hang around by the street light
In the heart of the night life

There came a certain man
A stranger to the crowd
We didn't understand
What he was all about
He walked a different pace
So out of place in Rocketown

They made a fool of him
They teased him when he'd speak
But when they knocked him down
He'd turn the other cheek
He told me I could find
A life outside of Rocketown
Hang around by the street light
In the heart of the night life

What was his mission
Where was he going
Why was his heart light
Always glowing
All I was missing
He stood there holding
What was his secret
Could I know it

Some didn't like him near
Some laughed and turned away
But me, I longed to hear
All that he had to say
He had a peace of mind
I couldn't find in Rocketown
And when I reached down inside me
I could feel the emptiness

What was his mission
Where was he going
Why was his heart light
Always glowing
All I was missing
He stood there holding
What was his secret
Could I know it

He said it's in the heart
This change that comes to be
Now he had done his part
The choice was up to me
As we were standing there
He said a prayer for Rocketown
As we were standing there
He said a prayer for Rocketown
As we were standing there
He said a prayer for Rocketown

He walked off silently
And prayed for me
And Rocketown

What was his mission
Where was he going
Why was his heart light
Always glowing
All I was missing
He stood there holding
What was his secret
Could I know it

Control, I give up control
I can't carry this alone
I've tried, for so long I've tried
To make it on my own
Now dreams are scattered on the ground
And now I'm on my knees

I, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I'm gonna run to You
I, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I'm gonna run to You, run to You

Weak, there are times I'm weak
If my scars could speak, they'd say
That grace is my only hope
Grace is showing me the way
To where all my shadows disappear
And healing waits for me

I, I can't help myself

I can't help myself
I'm gonna run to You
I, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I'm gonna run to You, run to You

What kind of love is this?
Lifts me up and draws me in
Tonight I'm just a heart running back home
When everything is pushed aside
All my plans and all my pride
Tonight I'm just a heart coming back home

I can't help myself
I'm gonna run to You
I, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I'm gonna run to You, run to You
I'm gonna run to You

Lost 
My heart is hard as stone 
On my own, alone, I carry it home 
Gone 
I used to waste the days, 
So distraught, I thought, I'm changing my ways 
Now you're changing my ways 

You save me 
Save me from myself 
There is no one else 
I'd lean on 
Save me 
You save me from myself 
There is no one else that sets me free 

Start 
The start of something new 
Is what I find, when I'm just looking at you. 
Lift 
You lift me off the ground, 
Keep holding my hand 
I won't bend or even look down 

Don't look down! 
Don't look down! 

You save me 
Save me from myself 
There is no one else 
I'd lean on 
Save me 
You save me from myself 
There is no one else that sets me free 

You save me 
Save me from myself 
There is no one else 
I'd lean on 
Save me 
You save me from myself 
There is no one else that sets me free

Young man up on the hillside
Teaching new ways
Each word winning them over
Each heart a kindled flame
Old men watch from the outside
Guarding their prey
Threatened by the voice of the paragon
Leading their lambs away
Leading them far away

Nobody knew His secret ambition
Nobody knew His claim to fame
He broke the old rules steeped in tradition
He tore the holy veil away
Questioning those in powerful position
Running to those who called His name
But nobody knew His secret ambition
Was to give His life away

His rage shaking the temple
His word to the wise
His hand healing on the seventh day
His love wearing no disguise
Some say, "Death to the radical
He's way out of line."
Some say, "Praise be the miracle
God sends a blessed sign.
A blessed sign for troubled times."

Nobody knew His secret ambition
Nobody knew His claim to fame
He broke the old rules steeped in tradition
He tore the holy veil away
Questioning those in powerful position
Running to those who called His name
But nobody knew His secret ambition
Was to give His life away

Kimu nkimaanyi
Buli muntu alina ensiigo
Omutima gwo gukulung 'aamye
Buli muntu alina ensiigo

Some people quietly reveal
In the manner of the meek
Some people shout the way they feel
To a radical degree
Some people sing it to express
While others hear another call
Some people speak with subtleness
Some don't rely on words at all
But let me tell you 'bout

One thing I know
Everybody's got a seed to sow
let your heart of hearts
Take you down the road
Everybody's got a seed to sow

We all are pieces of the whole
With different feelings to evoke
Giving distinction to the role
Different players-different strokes
But let me tell you 'bout

Some people walk
Some people race
Some people vary in their pace
But God can use what you can give
Within the mystery of His ways
Don't underestimate

Chorus

From the first breath of her life
She flew straight into my arms
I used to catch her from the swings
When she was five
And now she dances on the wind
In a world as hard as stone
She's so anxious to begin
And ready to fly

And she walks with me
And she talks with me
And I hold her hand in mine
I know she'll find her way
Like the light of day
Cause it's love that makes her strong

Though I cannot stop the rain
And I cannot turn the tide
And I am sure there will be things 
That break her heart
I can only let her know
I am always on her side
And even as I let her go
I'll never be far

And she walks with me
And she talks with me
In her eyes I see her truth
Born of her fire and grace
As she finds her place
Cause it's love that makes her strong

And she walks with me
And she talks with me
In my eyes she'll see my prayer
As she turns each page
Through this tender age
It is love that makes her strong
It's her love that makes her strong

The enemy has been defeated
And death couldn't hold You down
The enemy has been defeated
And death couldn't hold You down

Shout unto God with a voice of triumph
Shout unto God with a voice of praise
Shout unto God with a voice of triumph
We lift Your name up, we lift Your name up

Hallelujah

You're weighed down with regret
You can't see the road ahead
Or the burden on your back
It seems the trek will never end
The winding paths that still descend
And up above a sky washed black
You just can't bear to look at that

Follow the signs
Open your eyes
Read between the lines of what you see
Look into the soul of reality
Open your mind
Look at the signs
Never look back at yesterday
Keep your gaze steady on the narrow way

Now you've found the sacred tree
You kneel upon the broken wheat
You watch your burden fall away
And all the things that you once sought
Now are counted less than lost
For now you see the light of day
The signs were pointing all the way

Follow the signs
Open your eyes
Look at the signs
Open your mind
Follow the signs

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the savior is born
Christ the savior is born 

Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord at thy birth
Jesus, Lord at thy birth

Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Come
Behold this child
In the manger
Gift of the Father's
Great love
Angels are down
As His glory
Surrounds them
Starlight
From Heaven above

Counting every moment
Biding all my time
Standing out here on my own
Searching for that someone
To heal this heart of mine
And keep me from being alone
But when will it be
And how will I know
I don't want to wait here forever

Somebody love me
Come and carry me away
Somebody need me
To be the blue in their grey
Somebody want me
The way I've always dreamed it could be
Won't somebody love me, love me

I'm waiting for somebody
To dance across the floor
Sweeping me off of my feet
I'm looking for the right one
To open up that door
And offer me a tender retreat
It's like wanting to sing
But needing a song
When will I hear the music playing

Somebody love me
Come and carry me away
Somebody need me
To be the blue in their grey
Somebody want me
The way I've always dreamed it could be
Won't somebody love me, love me

Counting every moment
Biding all my time
Standing out here on my own
Searching for that someone
To heal this heart of mine
And keep me from being alone
But when will it be
And how will I know
I don't want to wait here forever

Somebody love me
Come and carry me away
Somebody need me
To be the blue in their grey
Somebody want me
The way I've always dreamed it could be
Won't somebody love me, love me

I'm waiting for somebody
To dance across the floor
Sweeping me off of my feet
I'm looking for the right one
To open up that door
And offer me a tender retreat
It's like wanting to sing

When will I hear the music playing

Somebody love me
Come and carry me away
Somebody need me
To be the blue in their grey
Somebody want me
The way I've always dreamed it could be
Won't somebody love me, love me

I wait for Kingdom come
When love will be here to stay
It will change us everyone
Someday, someday
There peace will make a stand
and the anger will fall away
We'll see the lion with the lamb
Someday, someday, someday

Standing in our silence
I hear my heart beating
And if only I could choose
I'd stay here with you
But hold me 'til the train is leaving
Somewhere down the line
After you're gone from sight
Our love will be the same
And, whispering your name,
I'll cling to you with all my might

Let me dream of you
But it's true
And wake me up when this is over
Love will be there when this is over and

Somewhere far beyond today
I will find a way to find you
And somehow through the lonely nights
I will leave a light in the dark
Let it lead you to my heart

There's a love inside us
Deep down inside
That goes without saying
Don't say a word
But I'll tell you just the same
And that love will fan the flame
And that flame will warm the heart that's waiting

You are mine and I'll wait for you my love
You are mine it may take some time
Even if it takes a lifetime
Tell me you'll wait

Somewhere far beyond today
I will find a way to find you
And somehow through the lonely nights
I will leave a light in the dark
Let it lead you to my heart

And somewhere alone
I will be praying you home
I know that somehow our love

Our love will lead me to your arms

Somewhere far beyond today
I will find a way to find you
And somehow through the lonely nights
I will leave a light in the dark
Let it lead you to my heart

Son of God, purest light, Lord on high is here tonight
Stamping through, this sacred sky suddenly our eyes behold
Heaven's perfect plan unfold, son of God

Son of God, love divine, timeless one, steps in to die
Who could dream of such a thing with us now the King of Kings
Man and angels bow and sing, singing Hallelujah, Hallelujah

And I will ever praise You

And I will ever praise You

I will seek You in the morning
And I will learn to walk in Your ways
And Step by step You'll lead me
And I will follow You all of my days

For you alone are worthy
And forever we will sing
Hallelujah!

When I'm down when my soul's in need of rest
Come your words of comfort and of hope
I see your face always smiling back at me
A stream of light shining straight to the heart
Child of God, child of light
There'll be no more lonely nights
Cause you have brightened up my life

There's a road that leads me to this place
A path of love running straight to the heart

Over the years I've learned one important thing
It's that real friends shall never truly be apart
You were there in my darkest time of need
With a hand reaching straight to the heart

Child of God, child of light
There'll be no more lonely nights
Cause you have brightened up my life

Take this gift, it is all I have to give
A prayer of love forever straight to the heart

Just to rest in your arms
Close enough to hear your heart
Just to kneel at your feet
Where everything fades away and I sing

Jesus, Jesus, take me over now
I surrender
Everything I have, I lay it down
All of me

With just a glimpse of your face
All my fears melt away
Lost within your embrace
I'm pouring out all my admiration

Glory so beautiful
The earth displays your majesty
How could you ever be
So mindful of someone as me

You captivate
Splendor I have never seen
Nothing else can compare
You're infinite
You're everywhere

You're everything I can't explain
You set my heart on fire
And here I stand amazed
You take my breath away
You take my breath away

See me, all I am
These empty hands
Are all I can give
That you would die so I'd live
Your sacrifice I can't believe

You fascinate
You stole my heart
I can't forget
And now that I've felt your love
No turning back, I can't get enough

You're everything I can't explain
You set my heart on fire
And here I stand amazed
You take my breath away
You take my breath away

The morning breaks
My soul awakes
You are my one desire
And here I stand amazed
You take my breath away
You take my breath away

With just one word
With just one glance
I'm lost in this divine romance
And every single day
More than I can say
You take my breath away

You're everything I can't explain
You set my heart on fire
And here I stand amazed
You take my breath away
You take my breath away

The morning breaks
My soul awakes
You are my one desire
And here I stand amazed
You take my breath away
You take my breath away

Oh, oh, oh
You take my breath away
Oh, oh, oh
You take my breath away
You take my breath away

Tearin' down the wall
Getting closer
Further ever, and ever, and ever

Tearin' down the wall
Getting closer
Further ever, and ever, and ever

Tearin' down the wall
Getting closer
Further ever, and ever, and ever

Tearin' down the wall
Getting closer
Further ever, and ever, and ever
Tearin' down the wall, the wall, the wall

Frosted window panes
Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree

Santa's on his way
He's filled his sleigh with things
Things for you and for me

It's that time of year
When the world falls in love
Every song you hear seems to say

Merry Christmas
May your New Year's dreams come true
And this song of mine
In three quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too!

Frosted window panes

Candles gleaming inside
Painted candy canes on the tree
Just look and you'll see

Santa's on his way

He's filled his sleigh

With things
Things for you and for me

It's that time of year

When the world falls in love

Every song you hear seems to say

Merry Christmas
May your New Year's dreams come true
And this song of mine
In three quarter time
Wishes you and yours
The same thing too!

Oh the happiest Christmas
Is a homecoming Christmas
With the snow fluttering down 'til the world seems new

Bright candles burning
Old friends returning
The wishes of children coming true
And the happiest wishes are just old fashioned wishes
May your days be merry, your sorrows be small
May the ones you love be near you
That's the happiest Christmas of all

repeat chorus

When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless your heart
I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus

King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is yours
Every single breath
I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself

You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about you,
It's all about you, Jesus

It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you

It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you

I'm coming back to the heart of worship

Sitting alone up in your empty room
In the stillness of the night
Where all the many dreams that used to carry you
Are no longer in sight
You put your feelings down in black and white
A sad, disturbing reply
That you don't really want to face another night
So you're saying goodbye
But do you know that you're saying goodbye
To a lifetime

Well, I've got to tell you there's another way
To be free to be complete
But, you've got to make it through another day
And deny your own defeat 
And I'm here to tell you there's another way
To consume a hungry heart
All the love you need is just a prayer away
Let it in to where you are

You've made it to the edge of seventeen
Thinking now you've reached the end of the line
But there's so much of life that you have never seen
Now you won't have the time
You say that you don't hear the music play
so you're ready to give up the dance
Now that nothing really matters anyway
Oh, you give up your chance
But do you know that you give up your chance
At a lifetime

Well, I've got to tell you there's another way
To be free to be complete
But, you've got to make it through another day
And deny your own defeat 
And I'm here to tell you there's another way
To consume a hungry heart
All the love you need is just a prayer away
Let it in to where you are

You put your feelings down in black and white
A sad, disturbing reply
That you don't really want to face another night
So you're saying goodbye
But do you know that you're saying goodbye
To a lifetime

Well, I've got to tell you there's another way
To be free to be complete
But, you've got to make it through another day
And deny your own defeat 
And I'm here to tell you there's another way
To consume a hungry heart
All the love you need is just a prayer away
Let it in to where you are

If they were to write about
The story of my life
They would have to mention you
With every page they'd write
There's another side to every story told
If I were the ocean
You would be the shore
And one without the other one
Would be needing something more
We are the shadow and the light

Always love me
 never leave me now
 now you are the other side of me
Always love me
 never leave me now
 now you are the other side of me

I have known the emptiness
Of feeling out of touch
And living life without you here
Would be living half as much
Cause I've a need that only you can fill

If love was mathematical
You'd understand the sum
to the heart's equation
Where one and one makes one
And lonely equals me minus you

Fear not, oh, Israel for there is peace still to come
A word to break the silence, a promise set to bloom
The promise to redeem us, one to free us
Break this silence in the violence in our lives

Emmanuel is sure to find us soon
The mighty rule to Jesse's star of truth
And bring us unto glory, tell His story
Heal the broken and restore thee to His name

The star will guide us to the humble place
Where Christ the King reveals His earthly face
And we will see Emmanuel, God is with us
God is for us, God is in us, we will see

We're singing Hallelujah
We're singing Hallelujah
Emmanuel, our God is with us

We're singing Hallelujah
We're singing Hallelujah
Emmanuel, our God is with us

We're singing Hallelujah
We're singing Hallelujah
Emmanuel, our God is with us

We're singing Hallelujah
We're singing Hallelujah
Emmanuel, our God is with us

Emmanuel, our God is with us

Got our feet on a narrow road
Got our eyes on the one who will be our goal
and our brothers at our side
If we stumble we won't fall
If we miss the mark He'll be there after all
With an everlasting prize
The race is on

Cone on and go
Leave behind the sin you find
That slows your time
Come on and go
You know the race is on
Come on and go
Straight ahead be safely led
By him instead
Come on and go
You know the race is on

Lord I try running my own race
Losin' ground, losin' hope
Losin' sight of your face
And I'm ready to retire

Then I'm back on your solid ground
You remind me of the strength
That in you I've found
And you fill me with your fire
The race is on

Cone on and go
Leave behind the sin you find
That slows your time
Come on and go
You know the race is on
Come on and go
Straight ahead be safely led
By him instead
Come on and go
You know the race is on

I feel it, I feel It, I feel It
In my bones and I just don't think I can hold it anymore

The river is rising flowing out of me
And I'm coming alive, I'm coming alive

I'm gonna dance and sing and move my feet
Cause the river is rising, flowing out of me

Got to let the world know take it to the streets
Got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise

Hallelujah the river is rising
Hallelujah the river is rising

I feel it, I feel It, I feel It
In my bones and I just don't think I can hold it anymore

The river is rising flowing out of me
And I'm coming alive, I'm coming alive

I'm gonna dance and sing and move my feet
Cause the river is high, flowing out of me

Got to let the world know take it to the streets
Got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise

Hallelujah the river is rising
Hallelujah
I'm gonna dance and sing and move my feet

Hallelujah
The river is rising
Oh, oh

The river is rising
The river is rising
Oh, oh

I feel it, I feel It, I feel It
In my bones and I just don't think I can hold it anymore

The river is high flowing out of me
And I'm coming alive, I'm coming alive

I'm gonna dance and sing and move my feet
Cause the river is high, flowing out of me

Got to let the world know take it to the streets
Got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise!

Hallelujah the river is rising
Hallelujah

Got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise

Hallelujah
The river is rising

Hallelujah
Got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Far above the highest heavens
On a throne of crystal light
Dwells the God of all creation
Rays of wonder crown His might
Human voices blend with the angels
Giving praise to God alone
Heavens music rises upward
To the Lamb upon the throne
To the Lamb upon the throne

Blessing! Glory! Sing Hallelujah!
Shout the saints of God alone
Honor! Power! and Dominion!
Praises gather at the throne
Oh, they gather at the crystal throne
Gather at the crystal throne

Lightning flashes and thunder echoes
Diamond rainbows fill the sky
Awesome beauty God's provision
Never seen by human eye
Blazing colors show the glory
Of the Master Artist's plan
Built by god for those who love Him
Those who trust the great "I am"
Those who trust the great "I am"

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

See from His head His hands His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown

Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
Bids me come and die and find
That I may truly live

Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
All who gather here
By grace draw near
And bless your name

Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were and offering far too small
Love so amazing so divine
Demands my soul my life my all

Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
Bids me come and die and find
That I may truly live

Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
All who gather here
By grace draw near
And bless your name

There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like You do
I could search For all eternity long 
And find There is none like You

There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like You do
I could search For all eternity long 
And find There is none like You

There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like You do
I could search For all eternity long 
And find There is none like You

I could search For all eternity long 
And find There is none like You

When the night
Seems to say
All hope is lost
Gone away
But I know
I'm not alone
By the light
She stands

There she waves
Faithful friend
Shimmering stars
Westward wind
Show the way
Carry me
To the place
She stands

Just when you think it might be over
Just when you think the fight is gone
Someone will risk his life to raise her
There she stands

There she flies
Clear blue skies
Reminds us with red
Of those that died
Washed in white
By the brave
In their strength
She stands

When evil calls itself a martyr
When all your hopes come crashing down
Someone will pull her from the rubble
There she stands

We've seen her flying torn and tattered
We've seen her stand the test of time
And through it all the fools have fallen
There she stands

By the dawn
Early light
And through the fight
She stands

When the night
Seems to say
All hope is lost
Gone away
But I know
I'm not alone
By the light
She stands

There she waves
Faithful friend
Shimmering stars
Westward wind
Show the way
Carry me
To the place
She stands

Just when you think it might be over
Just when you think the fight is gone
Someone will risk his life to raise her
There she stands

There she flies
Clear blue skies
Reminds us with red
Of those that died
Washed in white
By the brave
In their strength
She stands

When evil calls itself a martyr
When all your hopes come crashing down
Someone will pull her from the rubble
There she stands

We've seen her flying torn and tattered
We've seen her stand the test of time
And through it all the fools have fallen
There she stands

By the dawn
Early light
And through the fight
She stands

It was a test that we could all hope to pass
But none of us would want to take
Faced with the choice to deny God and live
For her there was one choice to make

This was her time
This was her dance
She lived every moment
Left nothing to chance

She swam in the sea
Drank of the deep
Embraced the mystery of all she could be
This was her time

Though you are mourning and grieving your loss
Death died a long time ago
Swallowed in life so that life carries on
Still it's so hard to let go

What if tomorrow 
And what if today
Faced with the question
Oh what would you say

This is your time
This is your dance
Make every moment
Leave nothing to chance

Swim in the sea
Drink of the deep
Call on the mercy
Hear yourself praying

Won't You save me
Won't You save me

It was a test that we could all hope to pass
But none of us would want to take
Faced with the choice to deny God and live
For her there was one choice to make

This was her time
This was her dance
She lived every moment
Left nothing to chance

She swam in the sea
Drank of the deep
Embraced the mystery of all she could be
This was her time

Though you are mourning and grieving your loss
Death died a long time ago
Swallowed in life so that life carries on
Still it's so hard to let go

What if tomorrow 
And what if today
Faced with the question
Oh what would you say

This is your time
This is your dance
Make every moment
Leave nothing to chance

Swim in the sea
Drink of the deep
Call on the mercy
Hear yourself praying

Won't You save me
Won't You save me

Who do I hope to finally be
Is it not your life in me
Yet the how's too hard to see
Too many times

Will I ever finally be
The true, intended me
Will the old in me be freed
And left behind

Too many times
I'm back inside
Wanting desperately to hide
Yet I know, I know you say
You have to die
Too many times
You hear my cries
I'm at the end of all my tries
So, I'm open Lord, so
Teach me how to die

Here I am again alone
Afraid I'll lose all that I own
Yet you see me as your own
I cannot fall

And what I am I still am not
At times I count the cost
Yet I find there's nothing lost
If I give it all

Too many times
I'm back inside
Wanting desperately to hide
Yet I know, I know you say
You have to die
Too many times
You hear my cries
I'm at the end of all my tries
So, I'm open Lord, so
Teach me how to die

Too many times
I'm back inside
Wanting desperately to hide
Yet I know, I know you say
You have to die
Too many times
You hear my cries
I'm at the end of all my tries
So, I'm open Lord, so
Teach me how to die

Lord, I will lift mine eyes to the hills 
Knowing my help is coming from You 
Your peace You give me in time of the storm

You are the source of my strength 
You are the strength of my life 
I lift my hands in total praise to You.

Amen, amen 
Amen, amen 
Amen, amen 
Amen, amen

Maybe there's a light in my soul
Maybe it flickers like a neon sign outside an abandoned hotel
Maybe there are things you just can't know
But can you say there are no mysteries in the house you choose to dwell
Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware
Maybe there's a place where we will fly
But some say God is dead like Nietzsche said and faith has made me a fool
But maybe there is more than meets the eye
Who's that stranger there beside you? Don't be smug and don't be cruel
Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware

Battles of the heart and of the mind
We stay caught in mental purgatory 'til our existence can be defined
Meanwhile on the shores of parallel
There may be a holy conference held somewhere discussing all mankind
Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware
I say maybe we are entertaining angels unaware
Angels unaware

Soaring, somewhere, longing, reaching
Searching, knowing, loving, caring

Let me take you by the hand
Lead you to the promised land
And trust Him with your heart
He'll lead you home

You breathe in me
And I'm alive
With the power of your holiness
You breathe in me
And you revive
Feelings in my soul
That I have laid to rest

So breathe in me
I need you now
I've never felt so dead within
So breathe in me
Maybe somehow
You can breathe new life
In me again

I used to be
So sensitive
To the light that leads
To where you are

Now I've acquired
These callouses
With the darkness of
A cold and jaded heart

So breathe in me
I need you now
I've never felt so dead within
So breathe in me
Maybe somehow
You can breathe new life
In me again

If they were to write about
The story of my life
They would have to mention you
With every page they'd write
There's another side to every story told
If I were the ocean
You would be the shore
And one without the other one
Would be needing something more
We are the shadow and the light

Always love me
 never leave me now
 now you are the other side of me
Always love me
 never leave me now
 now you are the other side of me

I have known the emptiness
Of feeling out of touch
And living life without you here
Would be living half as much
Cause I've a need that only you can fill

If love was mathematical
You'd understand the sum
to the heart's equation
Where one and one makes one
And lonely equals me minus you

Always love me
 never leave me now
 now you are the other side of me
Always love me
 never leave me now
 now you are the other side of me

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full, in his wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of your glory and grace

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full, in his wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of your glory and grace

Follow the footsteps
Or travel down your own road
Designing your fate
Hear what your heart says
Still you decide which way to go
Your life's an open gate

Le bon et le mal
These are the voices
We nous somme liberti
We make the choices

Echoes of laughter
Dancing in distant corridors
With the tears of hearts undone
Dreams we chase after
Give us the key to any door
We are what we become

Le bon et le mal
These are the voices
We nous somme liberti
We make the choices

Holding and reaching
We face the calm, we face the fear
As we learn to win and lose
Voices are speaking
Still we hear what we want to hear
Our life is ours to choose

Le bon et le mal
These are the voices
We nous somme liberti
We make the choices

A silent call from a distant land
Crying for a helping hand, so
How long will it go on?
Ignorance and vanity
Supersede humanity, so
How long it will go on?
I want to know how long will it go on?

We can't wait any longer
They're crying out, doesn't it matter
We can't wait any longer
No, no. Too long in a slumber
Shake it up,wake it up now.
We can't wait any longer. No, no.

Another child is laid to rest
Another day of hopelessness, so
How long it will go on?
And every day we're on the fence brings
Another fatal consequence, so
How long will it go on?
I want to know, how long will it go on?

Yuko awezayo kusikia kilio chetu? 
Twaomba msaada wenu 
Aweko mwenye kuttuoka 
Aweko mwenye kutupa uhuru

I can't believe that I'm here
Having to say goodbye.
And I can barely see you through
These tears I cry.
I close my eyes.

I can hear the sound
As angels gather 'round
Saying this is where you belong
Welcome Home!

There are the days that my heart aches
wishing you were here.
But I know where you are
The hurt and the pain disappear.
There's no more tears.

Welcome Home!

What a lovely sound
Angels all around
Saying this is where you belong
Welcome Home!
Welcome Home!
Welcome Home!

Tears are falling, hearts are breaking
How we need to hear from God
You've been promised, we've been waiting
Welcome Holy Child
Welcome Holy Child

Hope that you don't mind our manger
How I wish we would have known
But long awaited Holy Stranger
Make yourself at home
Please make yourself at home

Bring your peace into our violence
Bid our hungry souls be filled
World now breaking Heaven's silence
Welcome to our world
Welcome to our world

Fragile finger sent to heal us
Tender brow prepared for them
Tiny heart whose blood will save us
Unto us is born
Unto us is born

So wrap our injured flesh around You
Breathe our air and walk our sod
Rob our sin and make us holy
Perfect Son of God
Perfect Son of God
Welcome to our world

What child is this
Who lay to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While Shepard's watch our keeping

This, this is Christ the King
Whom Shepard's guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud
The Babe, the son of Mary

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant King to own him
The King of Kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone him

This, this is Christ the King
Whom Shepard's guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him laud

Word of mouth is the counselor
There is no need for proof
In a world that's wired for sound
The tongue becomes the mighty sword
That battles the truth
In a world that's wired for sound

Coming on like a tidal wave
That washes through the brain-a state of mind
No dispute when the noise is made
And so it lets the blind lead the blind
Lured by charisma to be swayed to believe

Word of mouth is the counselor
There is no need for proof
In a world that's wired for sound
The tongue becomes the mighty sword
That battles the truth
In a world that's wired for sound

Easier believing what is hard to get rid of than to try
Never searching just accepting
Feeds the mind enough to get you by
Scratching the surface yet to dig deeper down

Word of mouth is the counselor
There is no need for proof
In a world that's wired for sound
The tongue becomes the mighty sword
That battles the truth
In a world that's wired for sound
Wisdom from the sacred page
Is turned and ignored
In a world that's wired for sound

Walk across the shore
Walk across the sea
Stand upon the waves
And walk with me
Journey through the door
Come see what I can see
All the reasons we were made
Who we were meant to be

Rise, He's calling you to go
Just leave it all behind
And rise above

Beyond the obvious
And what you can attain
Past the here and now
Where faith remains
Lift your weary head
There's too much left to lose
More than you can imagine
It's waiting there for you

Rise, He's calling you to come
Just leave it all behind
And rise above

Come and stand
And join with me as one
Now take my hand and we
Will rise above

     

Rise, He's calling you to come
Just leave it all behind
And rise above
Come and stand
And join with me as one
Now take my hand and we
Will rise above

  
Come stand with me
  
Come stand with me

Sometimes I wonder what it's like
To be living life on the other side
Please don't make me feel like I don't know
What's out there
Proof is written in the sky
Hey won't you listen to me now
It makes no difference if I wish upon a star
The only absolute is that the Word of Life
Is written on my heart
Oh I believe
Yes, I believe

Hey look at me, living life for you
When it's good, when it's hard
You know me, you know my heart
Yea, yea, yea I give up anything at all
When you call
All I know it's worth it all

I know you're scared to let me know you
I know you got a heavy kind of soul
And I know it's harder to believe in love when you're
Feeling all alone
They're taking bets on who the lover of your soul
And your heart is gonna be
They're taking on all the things that get you down and out
The moment you believe
I believe in you
Yes, I believe in you

You are holy
You are mighty
You are worthy
Worthy of praise
I will follow
I will listen
I will love you
All of my days

I will sing to 
And worship
The Kingdom is worthy
I will love and adore Him
And I will bow down before Him
And I will sing to and worship the Kingdom is worthy 
And I will love and adore
And I will bow down before Him
You're my prince of peace
And I will live my life for You

I will follow
I will listen
I will love you
All of my days

All of my days

I will sing to 
And worship

And I will bow down before Him
And I will sing to and worship the Kingdom is worthy 
And I will love and adore
And I will bow down before Him
You're my prince of peace
And I will live my life for You

You are holy
You are mighty

All of my days

Worthy, we stand
Saved by His hand
Great is Your name
In all the earth
Worthy alone
Christ on the throne
Your kingdom will reign forever
You are the Lord, Most High

REPEAT

Your kingdom will reign
Forever and ever

REPEAT

I knew you were the one,
My heart was overcome,
The day I looked into your eyes.

The feeling so surreal,
Like time was standing still.
When you said you would be mine.

Oh you are a miracle, you're sweeter than I've ever dreamed.
You're so much more than beautiful.
How can it be, that you belong to me?

So walk with me awhile,
And we will spend our lives,
Learning the mysteries of love.

And through the darkest nights

We'll hold each other tight,
I promise that it will be enough.

Oh you are a miracle, you're sweeter than I've ever dreamed.
You're so much more, more than beautiful.
How can it be that you belong to me?

Oh girl you are more than beautiful,
How can this be, that you belong to me?

I love you, I love you, I love you.
Girl I love you, Oh you are, You are more than beautiful.
How can this be, that you belong to me?

Made a friend last night or you thought you did
Had a drink, had a talk, took a drive
Shared the night, gave up a part of your soul
Now she's gone and you're a little less alive

Shake it off
Never let your feelings begin
But your defenses are down
And the fear is closing in

Yes, you really need a saviour
Somehow you've known it all along
Yes, you really need a saviour
You know you've heard it for so long

Yes, you really need a saviour
Someone to come and lead you on
You need a saviour, you need a saviour
It's time

Told yourself today just for your own sake
What was lost wouldn't cost anyway
Life's a one night stand, this time you'll win
The up and down, life long game that you play

Shake it off
Never let your feelings begin
But your defenses are down
And the fear is closing in

Yes, you really need a saviour
Somehow you've known it all along
Yes, you really need a saviour
You know you've heard it for so long

Yes, you really need a saviour
Someone to come and lead you on
You need a saviour, you need a saviour
It's time

Yes, you really need a saviour
Somehow you've known it all along
Yes, you really need a saviour
You know you've heard it for so long

Yes, you really need a saviour
Someone to come and lead you on
You need a saviour, you need a saviour

Yes, you need a saviour

Come on

Yes, you really need a saviour

It's time

(You need a saviour, you need a saviour

You're alright
You take a look inside
But you don't like what you see
And so you choose to look away
It doesn't coincide
With how you'd like to be
And each glimpse of hope can easily fade

Down on your confidence
It's a fight that won't let go
 you've got to realize
That you're alright
 under your rubble
Lies a heart the Father holds
And when you see your life
through his eyes
You're alright

To learn how He loves you
Is to learn to love yourself
To live the life He's livin' in you
 what others think of you
Could never measure to the wealth
Of what he's paid and given to you

Down on your confidence
It's a fight that won't let go
 you've got to realize
That you're alright
 under your rubble
Lies a heart the Father holds
And when you see your life
Through his eyes
You're alright

You're arriving with the sound of thunder and rain
You're arriving in the calm of the wind and the waves
You're arriving in the glow of a burning flame
A burning flame

Praise awaits You at the dawn when the world come alive
Praise awaits You in the darkness and shines in the light
Praise awaits You with a song of love and desire, love and desire

Here comes the King
All bow down
Lift up your voices
Unto the Lamb
He is the King
All bow down
All bow down

You are coming again like a thief in the night
You are coming again with a shout from the sky
You are coming again to take away Your bride
To take away Your bride

Yeah, You are the King

You are the King
All bow down
We lift up our voices
Unto the Lamb
You are the King

Precious cornerstone, sure foundation
You are faithful to the end
We are waiting, on You, Jesus
We believe You're all to us

We will see You, face to face
And forever, we will worship

Yeah You are all
You're everything to us

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

The Earth shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine
But God, Who called me here below
Will be forever mine
Will be forever mine
You are forever mine

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

The hour I first believed

My chains are gone
I've been set free

You are forever mine

America-Chris Tomlin 

Let your glory fly 
If my people will humbly pray 
Turn from sin and their wicked ways 
I will hear them and heal their land 
And show my glory and power again 
Lift your eyes up 
Look to the sky 
The Lord is coming, coming to America 
Can you feel the fire 
Can you see the wind 
Blowing through 
Coming to America again 
Go and tell them the blind will see 
The lame will walk and the slave is free 
Shout the news that the lost are saved 
In the name of Jesus the dead are raised 

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria in excelsius deo 
Gloria in excelsius deo

Shepherds why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be,
Which inspire your heavenly song?
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ our lord, the new born king
Gloria in excelsius deo 
Gloria in excelsius deo 
Gloria in excelsius deo 
Gloria in excelsius deo

Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me
Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me
I come alive, I'm alive when you breathe on me
I come alive, I'm alive when you breathe on me

Awake, awake, awake my soul
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, through you alone
Awake my soul

Speak to me, word of God, speak to me
Speak to me, word of God, speak to me
I come alive, I'm alive when you speak to me
I come alive, I'm alive when you speak to me

Awake, awake, awake my soul
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, through you alone
Awake my soul

Then He said to me
Prophesy to these bones and say to them
Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!
This is what the sovereign Lord says to these bones
I will make breath enter you
And you will come to life
So I prophesied as I was commanded
As I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound
And the bones came together, bone to bone
And I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them
And skin covered them, but there was no breath in them
Then He said to me
Prophesy to the breath
Prophesy, son of man, and say to it
Conjure the four winds of breath and breathe

Awake, awake, awake my soul
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, through you alone
Awake my soul

Awake, awake, awake my soul
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, through you alone
Awake my soul

Yeah, I'm not alone, I realize
I breathe out, I come alive
Your word gives life to my dry bones
Your breath tells death it can ride on
Awake me, make me a living stone
A testament to your throne, I
I'm nothing without you, I'm on my own
The only one who satisfies my soul

In our hearts, Lord, in this nation
Awakening
Holy Spirit, we desire
Awakening

For You and You alone
Awake my soul, awake my soul and sing
For the world You love
Your will be done, let Your will be done in me

In Your presence, in Your power
Awakening
For this moment, for this hour
Awakening

For You and You alone
Awake my soul, awake my soul and sing
For the world You love
Your will be done, let Your will be done in me

For You and You alone
Awake my soul, awake my soul and sing
For the world You love
Your will be done, let Your will be done in me

Like the rising sun that shines
From the darkness comes a light
I hear Your voice and this is my
Awakening

Like the rising sun that shines
From the darkness comes a light
I hear Your voice and this is my
Awakening

Like the rising sun that shines
Awake my soul, awake my soul and sing
From the darkness comes a light
Awake my soul, awake my soul and sing

Like the rising sun that shines
Awake my soul, awake my soul and sing
Only You can raise a life
Awake my soul, awake my soul and sing

Great are You, Lord
Mighty in strength
You are faithful

All of our days
It's for Your glory
We offer everything

Raise your hands all you nations

I heard your echo in the canyon
Upon the timberline
You said these mountains were your invention
And so was this heart of mine
I heard you whisper on the water,
There on the mighty sea
You spoke of love deep as the ocean
When You spoke of Your love for me

I am loved by the Father
I am loved by the Son
It is love that has captured
The heart of this wayward one
I heard your laughter in the sunrise,
Amidst the morning birds
A song of freedom for all creation
And you sang me every word
I heard you singing in the silence,
A simple melody
Words of love, O I can hear it
My Father is very fond of me

Oh heart of mine why must you stray?
From One so fair you run away
And one more time you have to pay
The heaviness of needless shame

Oh heart of mine come back home
You've been too long out on your own
And He's been there all along
Watching for you down the road

So come home running
His arms are open wide
His name is Jesus and He understands
He is the answer you are looking for
So come home running just as you are

Oh child of God so dearly loved
And ransomed by the saviour's blood
Called by name, daughter and son
Wrapped in the robe of righteousness

So come home running
His arms are open wide
His name is Jesus and He understands
He is the answer you are looking for
So come home running just as you are

So come home running
His arms are open wide
His name is Jesus and He understands
He is the answer you are looking for
So come home running just as you are

Just as you are

Come, let us worship and bow down 
Before the Lord Most Holy 
Before the King of Glory 

Come and lay your burdens down 
Before the Friend who's faithful 
Before the One who's able 

For He is our God 
And we are His people 
 He is our God 
And we will never be forsaken 

Come, let us lift our voice in praise 
Unto the Rock of Ages 
Unto the God who saves us 

Come and glorify His name 
All the earth together 
All the saints forever 

You are our God 
And we are Your people 
You are our God 
And we will be with You Forever 

You reign in endless power above the world you made
Across the sky is written your majesty and praise
And still you move in mercy and hear the humble heart
For every soul that's searching, Jesus there you are

Your beauty fills the sky
Your glory reigns in brilliant light
Great God of countless wonders
I will lift my eyes

Your beauty fills the sky
Your glory reigns in brilliant light
Great God of countless wonders

Every star, every ocean, the universe proclaims
For every sun that rises, your faithfulness to me
Like the changing of the seasons, like the river to the sea

Your beauty fills the sky
Your glory reigns in brilliant light
Great God of countless wonders
I will lift my eyes, lift my eyes

No one can fathom all your mighty works O God
Just one glimpse of You and I am overcome
You open up your hand and pour out once again
Your everlasting love

Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for me
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity

Majesty, Lord of all
Let every throne before Him fall
The King of kings, O come adore
Our God who reigns forever more

Crown Him Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

Majesty, Lord of all
Let every throne before Him fall
The King of kings, O come adore
Our God who reigns forever more, forever more

All hail, Redeemer, hail
For He has died for me

I saw Mrs. Parker at the store today, 
she was buyin' some food 
I walked up to her and I said "Hey!" 
"When's the baby due?" 

She said "Baby?" 
"I'm not having a baby," 
"what you talkin' about?" 
I said "Sorry... Mrs. Parker" 
I put my foot in my mouth 

 
I got my foot in my mouth, 
guess I should watch what I say, 
I got my foot in my mouth, 
it's prob'ly better that way 

I took my brother to the mall last Christmas, 
to see Santa and his sleigh, 
I said "Aren't you glad that you're old enough," 
"to know that Santa is fake?" 

He said "Fake? Santa's not fake!" 
"What you talkin about?" 
I said "No, I didn't tell ya Santa was fake!" 
"I said...Santa's great..." 
I put my foot in my mouth 

 

"here's the last verse" 

I was braggin' to a friend of mine 
how I ran over this cat, 
I said "His name was fluffy, cause I read the tag..." 
"right after I squashed him flat" 

She said "Fluffy? My cat's name is Fluffy! He was my best friend." 
I said "No, I didn't say his name was Fluffy!" 
"I said his name was... Twinkles" 
here I go again...

There is an endless song
Echoes in my soul
I hear the music ring

And though the storms may come
I am holding on
To the rock I cling

How can I keep from singing Your praise
How can I ever say enough
How amazing is Your love
How can I keep from shouting Your name
I know I am loved by the King
And it makes my heart want to sing

I will lift my eyes
In the darkest night
For I know my Savior lives

And I will walk with You
Knowing You'll see me through
And sing the songs You give

I can sing in the troubled times
Sing when I win
I can sing when I lose my step
And fall down again
I can sing 'cause You pick me up
Sing 'cause You're there
I can sing 'cause You hear me, Lord
When I call to You in prayer
I can sing with my last breath
Sing for I know
That I'll sing with the angels
And the saints around the throne

There is an endless song
Echoes in my soul
I hear the music ring

And though the storms may come
I am holding on
To the rock I cling

How can I keep from singing Your praise
How can I ever say enough
How amazing is Your love
How can I keep from shouting Your name
I know I am loved by the King
And it makes my heart want to sing

I will lift my eyes
In the darkest night
For I know my Savior lives

And I will walk with You
Knowing You'll see me through
And sing the songs You give

I can sing in the troubled times
Sing when I win
I can sing when I lose my step
And fall down again
I can sing 'cause You pick me up
Sing 'cause You're there
I can sing 'cause You hear me, Lord
When I call to You in prayer
I can sing with my last breath
Sing for I know
That I'll sing with the angels
And the saints around the throne

The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty

Trembles at His voice

Be still, there is a healer
His love is deeper than the sea
His mercy, it is unfailing
His arms are a fortress for the weak

Let faith arise
Let faith arise

I lift my hands to believe again
You are my refuge, You are my strength
As I pour out my heart, these things I remember
You are faithful, God, forever

Be still, there is a river
That flows from Calvary's tree
A fountain for the thirsty
Pure grace that washes over me

So let faith arise
Let faith arise
Open my eyes
Open my eyes

I lift my hands to believe again
You are my refuge, You are my strength
As I pour out my heart, these things I remember
You are faithful, God
You are faithful, God, forever

In the secret, in my quiet place
In the stillness you are there.
In the secret in my quiet hour, 
Only for you.
Cause I want to know you more.

:
I want to know you
I want to hear your voice.
I want to know you more.
I want to touch you.
I want to see your face
I want to know you more.

I am reaching for the highest goal
And I might reseed the grass.
  Nowhere pushing every anger to side, 
Out of my way,
Cause I want to know you more.

There's a peace I've come to know
Though my heart and flesh may fail
There's an anchor for my soul
I can say "It is well"

Jesus has overcome
And the grave is overwhelmed
The victory is won
He is risen from the dead

And I will rise when He calls my name
No more sorrow, no more pain
I will rise on eagles' wings
Before my God fall on my knees
And rise
I will rise

There's a day that's drawing near
When this darkness breaks to light
And the shadows disappear
And my faith shall be my eyes

Jesus has overcome

And rise
I will rise

And I hear the voice of many angels sing,
"Worthy is the Lamb"
And I hear the cry of every longing heart,
"Worthy is the Lamb"

Tell me why 
I always do, 
things that I know deep down 
I don't really want to do. 
I try to walk in faith 
but it's not easy with him around 
ahh, with him around. 
Like when you're walkin' in the dark 
and you stub your toe. 
It hurts so bad, makes you mad, 
and cuss words start to flow. 
And Satan, he's just laughing, 'cause 
he knows I'm fallin' in despair. 
I wish he's fight me fair. 
If the devil was a man 
with a body just like mine 
if it wasn't a sin to fight with him, 
I'd punch him in the eye. 
He can growl and snarl at me but 
all to no avail. 
If the devil was a man, I'd kick his tail. 

Sometimes I hear an unholsome tough. 
And I say things I shouldn't say, 
when I should probably walk away. 
And it's a sin I've got spinnin' 
And satan thinks he's gonna win, 
aww...think again. 
I can punch, I can kick. 
Feed him food that makes him sick. 
If the devil was a man with a body just like mine 
If it wasn't a sin to fight with him, 
I'd punch him in the eye. 
He can growl and snarl at me 
but all to no avail. 
If the devil was a man I'd kick his tail. 
You might think that I'm crazy, 
you might say that I'm a nut. 
But if the devil was a man, I'd kick his... 
But I guess you're wonderin', 
what kind of spell I'm under 
singin' songs of silly fantasies. 
You know that I'm just jokin', 
there's no better way to hope for 
'Cause I know, greater is He that's alive in me. 

 

Sometimes my life is full of sin, 
girl walks by, I look at her, 
and I look at her again. 
And I'm too proud to pray out loud 
and say what I've done wrong, 
aww that devil's strong. 
Things are lookin' bad for me 
but I know there's victory. 
'Cause the devil ain't a man 
with a body just like mine. 
Sometimes he sneaks up on me 
and hits me from behind. 
He can growl and snarl at me, 
but all to no avail. 
'Cause my God's big enough to kick his tail. 
My God's big enough, 
My God's big enough, 
yea, My God's big enough 
My God's big enough 
 
My God's big enough 
My God's big enough 
 
My God's big enough 
My God's big enough 
My God's big enough to kick his little red tail.

From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
Creation revealing Your majesty
From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring
Every creature unique in the song that it sings
All exclaiming

You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
You are amazing God
All powerful, untameable,
Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
You are amazing God

Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
None can fathom

O gratefully sing HIs wonderful love
Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days
Paviolioned in splendor, and girded with praise

2. O tell of His might, O sing of His grace
Whose robe is the light and canopy space
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form
And dark is His path on the wings of the storm

3. O measureless might, ineffable love
While angels delight to worship above
Thy mercies how tender, how firm to the end
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend

Chorus:
You alone are the matchless King
To You alone be all majesty
Your glories and wonders, what tongue can recite?
You breathe in the air, You shine in the light

Everyone around the world
Hear the joyful sound
See the heavens open up
Hear the music coming down

Nothing's gonna separate us from the Father's love
I can't help but celebrate
'Cause we're not alone

If God is on our side
Who can be against us?
If God is on our side
We won't be afraid

Though the mountains may fall
And the sky will crumble
There ain't nothin' gonna stand in our way

Come on down to the riverside
Wash it all away
Leave behind your troubled mind
For an uncloudy day

Nothing's gonna separate us from the Father's love
I can't help but celebrate
'Cause we're not alone.

Now peace like water ever flows.

Yours is the power.
Your is the glory forever.

I'm no hero of the faith,
I'm not as strong as I once thought I was
I'm just a shepherd boy,
Singing to a choir of burning lights

I'm just singing, singing over you
Come and lay your troubles down
'Cause love is breaking through

I was born to lift a song of hope
See the heavens open up
Take this armor lest I die
Take this crown and let me fly

We're just singing, singing out to You
Our hearts are Yours forever
Your love is breaking through

Love is a fire
Love is a fire
Love is a fire

You are worthy worthy 
You are holy holy 
You are holy holy 
You are worthy worthy 
You are worthy worthy 
You are holy holy 
You are holy holy 
You are worthy worthy 
You are worthy worthy 
You are holy holy 
You are holy holy 
Yeah 

When I was held up in chains 
The river was free 
When I was covered in stains 
The river was clean 
When I was losing my way 
The river found me 

I can see the river 
I can feel the river 
I'm letting go of all I hold onto 
Let it wash away 

When we were broken inside 
The river was love 
When we were thirsty and dry 
You were more than enough 
When we were drowning in lies 
The river saved us 

I'm dancing in the river 
And I'll be here forever 
I'm letting go of everything but You 
Carry me away 

Carry me away... 

Caught in the half-light, I'm caught alone 
Waking up to the sunrise, and the radio 
Feels like I'm tied up, what's holding me? 
Juts praying today will be the day I go Free. 

Chorus: 
I want to live like there's no tomorrow 
I want to dance like no one's around. 
I want to sing like no one's listening. 
Before I lay my body down 

I want to give like I have plenty. 
I want to love like I'm not afraid. 
I want to be the man I was meant to be. 
I want to be the way I was made. 

Made in Your likeness, made in Your hands. 
Made to discover who You are and who I am 
All I've forgotten help me to find. 
All that You've promised let it be in my life.

When I survey the wondrous Cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain, I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

See from His head, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet?
Or thorns compose, so rich a crown

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live

Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

It's the beauty and the shame
It's the glory and the name
Wonderful Cross

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Oh the wonderful Cross, oh the wonderful Cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live

A refuge for the poor
A shelter from the storm
This is our God
He will wipe away your tears
And return your wasted years
This is our God
Ooh, ooh, this is our God

A father to the orphan
A healer to the broken
This is our God
He brings peace to our madness
And comfort in our sadness
This is our God
Ooh, ooh, this is our God

This is the one we have waited for
This is the one we have waited for
This is the one we have waited for
Ooh, ooh, this is our God

A fountain for the thirsty
A lover for the lonely
This is our God
He brings glory to the humble
And crowns for the faithful
This is our God
Ooh, ooh, this is our God

You are the one I have waited for
You are the one I have waited for
You are the one I have waited for
Ooh, ooh, this is our God

Great is Your faithfulness

True are Your promises

So we raise up holy hands 
To praise the Holy One 
Who was and is and is to come 

Wide is Your love and grace

You never fail, O God 

You were, You are 
You will always be 

Holy Uncreated One 
Your beauty fills the skies 
But the glory of Your majesty 
Is the mercy in Your eyes 

Worthy Uncreated One 
From heaven to earth come down 
You laid aside Your royalty 
To wear the sinner's crown 

O Great God, be glorified 
Our lives laid down 
Yours magnified 
O Great God, be lifted high 
There is none like You 

Jesus, Savior, God's own son 
Risen, reigning Lord 
Sustainer of the Universe 
By the power of Your word 

And when we see Your matchless face 
In speechless awe we'll stand 
And there we'll bow with grateful hearts 
Unto the Great I am

The battle rages on 
As storms and tempests roar 
We cannot win this fight 
Inside our rebel hearts 

We're laying down our weapons now 

We raise our white flag 
We surrender all to You, all for you 
We raise our white flag: the war is over 
Love has come, your love has won 

Here on this holy ground 
You made a way for peace 
Laying your body down 
You took our rightful place 

This freedom song is marching on

Though darkness fills the night
It cannot hide the light

Whom shall I fear

You crush the enemy
Underneath my feet
You are my sword and shield
Though troubles linger still

I know who stands behind

The God of angel armies
Is always by my side

For you alone can save
You will deliver me

We are here because of grace because of love 
We are here because of You because of You 
You are here because of grace because of love 
And You are here because of You because of You 
You fill our hearts with more than we 
Can hold inside and so we sing 

Beautiful savior, Wonderful king  
  

Oh beautiful sound the joy of heaven here 
Oh wonderful sound love of heaven now 
Oh beautiful sound the joy of heaven here 
Oh wonderful sound love of heaven now 
Oh beautiful sound the joy of heaven here 
Oh wonderful sound, oh wonderful sound 

CHORUS 

You spread out the skies over empty space 
Said "let there be light" 
Into a dark and formless world Your light 
was born 

You spread out Your ams over empty hearts 
Said "let there be light" 
Into a dark and hopeless world Your Son 
was born 

You made the world and saw that it was good 
You sent Your only son for You are good 

What a wonderful Maker 
What a wonderful Savior 
How majestic Your whispers 
And how humble Your love 
With a strength like no other 
And the heart of a Father 
How majestic Your whispers 
What a wonderful God 

No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross 
And we have only heard 
The faintest whispers of how great You are  

I'm created for You alone
Bought with a price I'm not my own
I'm seated in the heavenlies
And there's no place I'd rather be
Than with You forever Lord

I'm created for You alone
Bought with a price I'm not my own
I'm seated in the heavenlies
And there's no place I'd rather be
Than with You forever Lord 
Than with You forever Lord 
Than with You forever Lord 

You are my treasure

Faithful Lord, fill my cup
With your grace and love, Your grace and love
The pleasures that this world's sure of
Will never be enough, can never be enough
Cause I'm created for You alone
Bought with a price I'm not my own
I'm seated in the heavenlies
And there's no place I'd rather be
Than with You forever Lord
You are my treasure

Faithful Lord, fill my cup
With your grace and love, Your grace and love
The pleasures that this world's sure of
They will never be enough, can never be enough

Cause I'm created for You alone
Bought with a price I'm not my own
I'm seated in the heavenlies
And there's no place I'd rather be
Than with You forever Lord
You are my treasure

I'm created for You alone
Bought with a price I'm not my own
I'm seated in the heavenlies
And there's no place I'd rather be
Than with You forever Lord
Than with You forever Lord
Than with You forever Lord

You are my treasure
You are my treasure
You are my treasure
You are my treasure

You turned my way
You heard my cry
You turned my mourning into shouting
Sorrow may last for a night
But with the light I am seeing
I am singing

You lifted me out
You lifted me out
And set me dancing, dancing
Free, now I am free
Your love rescued me
Now it's the anthem I'm singing

Many will see
Many will hear
And find You strong enough to save
Many the wonders You have done
Your light has come, I am singing
I am singing

Lost is where You found me
Shattered and frail
But You love me still
Trouble may surround me
My heart may fail
But You never will
You never will

I heard Your song coming over the hill
I knew it seemed like the world stood still
You were singin' a melody that caught me by surprise
Yeah it sounded familiar to me, like I'd known it all my life

And I keep looking down as I move in closer
My heart is racing now with fear and wonder
Could I come back to You so long on my own 
From where I am, I know this is not my home 

 You're the one I believe
A king, and friend has always been holding onto me
You're the one that I have seen
Your life and death the endless breath breathing into me

Just the mention of Your name and I know, I know I've found love
'Cause You're the one

High in a hidden world is where You are found
Where every living thing circles around
I find myself again where I used to be
With the rescued ones falling on my knees

 You're the one I believe
A king, and friend has always been holding onto me
You're the one that I have seen
Your life and death the endless breath breathing into me

Just the mention of Your name and I know, I know I've found love
'Cause You're the one

In Your presense there is mercy
In the fear, joy and the tears
It's Your goodness that keeps on, keeps on calling us here
Drawing us near

 You're the one I believe
A king, and friend has always been holding onto me
You're the one that I have seen
Your life and death the endless breath breathing into me

Just the mention of Your name and I know, I know I've found love
'Cause You're the one

Great is your faithfulness oh God
You wrestle with the sinner's heart
You lead us by still waters and to mercy
And nothing can keep us apart

Pre Chorus:
So remember your people
Remember your children
Remember your promise
Oh God

Chorus:
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough for me

Verse 2:
Great is your love and justice God
You use the weak to lead the strong
You lead us in the song of your salvation
And all your people sing along

Chorus 2:
Your Grace is enough
Heaven reaching down to us
Your Grace is enough for me

God, I see your grace is enough 
I'm covered in your love
Your grace is enough for me

For me

How blessed are those who dwell in Your house
Who's lives become roads that You travel
They wind through the valley?s to the light of the sun

One day in this beautiful place to worship
Your house is our home
Where our faces will shine in the light of the son

The cross has released us
To sing of Your freedom

Belongs to You alone

All for love the Father gave
For only love could make a way

But still You forgive
If only I ask
And how many times have You heard me pray
Draw near to me

Everything I need is You

When I'm poor, I know I'm rich 
For in the power of Your name 
All things are possible

Did You rise the sun for me?
Or paint a million stars that I might
Know your majesty?
Is Your voice upon the wind?
Is everything I've known marked?
With my maker's fingerprints?

Breathe on me
Let me see Your face
Ever I will seek You

'Cause all You are, is all I want, always
Draw me close in Your arms
Oh God, I want to be with You

Can I feel You in the rain?
Abandon all I am to have You
Capture me again
Let the earth resound with praise
Can You hear as all creation lives
To glorify one name?

The holiest place there could ever be
All you can do is bow
Before the one who made heaven and earth
Before the Almighty God
For Him alone

Sing with the angels
Sing with the angels
Singing the name of the lord
Singing the name of the lord

For every soul 
He gave it all
Given for all of mankind
Eternal life is His alone
Given to all who believe 
In Him alone

Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus.

Oh Lord You've searched me
You know my way
You fail with my failure
I know You love me

Your holy presence
Surrounded me
In every season
I know You love me
I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

You go before me
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
And I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this

You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done

And when the earth fails
Falls from my eyes
And You stand before me
I know You love me
Oh, I know You love me

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no

You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now

You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done

You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You taught a way, You made a way
When You said that it is done

Here in this house of the great King
We come together now to worship Him

I said on Sunday how much I want revival
But then on Monday I can't even find my bible
Where's power, the power of the cross in my life?
I'm sick of playing the game of religion

I'm tired of loosing my reason for living
Where's power, the power of the cross in my life?
I'm not content just to walk through my life
Giving in to the lies walking in compromises

Now we cried out as a generation that was lost
But now is found in the power of the cross
We believe in You, we believe in the power of the cross and it?s true
We believe in You, so we lay down the cause that the cross might be found in You

I'm not satisfied living in my own ways

Lord I come
Lord I thank you
For your love
For this grace divine
Love and mercy
Undeserving
You gave it all
The greatest sacrifice

You were wounded
For my sin
You were bruised
For all my shame
You were broken
For my healing
Only by the cross 
I am saved

You're the mender of the broken
To every outcast
A friend and comforter

I come boldly to your presence
Lord I bow before your throne
You're my healer
My redeemer
You're my hope, my life, my heart

You hear the cry of the broken
You hear the cry of the broken
You hear the cry of the broken
You answer the cry of the broken
You answer the cry of the broken
You answer the cry of the broken

This is my prayer in the desert
And all that's within me feels dry
This is my prayer in the hunger in me
My God is a God who provides

And this is my prayer in the fire
In weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved
Of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord through the flames

And I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon forged against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

And this is my prayer in the battle
And triumph is still on it's way
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
So firm on His promise I'll stand

I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon forged against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon forged against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

And this is my prayer in the harvest
When favor and providence flow
I know I'm filled to be emptied again
The seed I've received I will sow

Holy Holy
I will bow before
My Lord and King
Hallelujah
You have come to us
You make all things new

Would you believe me if I said
That we are the ones who can make the change 
In the world today
Would you believe me if I said 
That all of the dreams in your heart 
Can come true today
Would you believe me if I said
That life could be all that you want it to be today

And if I had wings I would fly 
'cause all that I need You are 
And if the world caved in around me 

To You I'd still hold on 
'cause Your all that I believe 
And the one that created me 
Jesus because of You I'm Free 

Would you believe me if I said
That God can make miracles happen today
Would you believe me if I said
That you don't need to wait for the answer before
You step out in faith 
Would you believe me if I said
That nothin' is ever impossible for God 

Just live you life with God inside
You won our regret one moment of it 
And give all that you can for God. for God

Will I was in need
I needed a friend
I was alone
I needed a hand
I was going down
But someone rescued me
My God cares too much to say
His mercies are new every day
I get down to pray
And then help is on it's way
I walk by faith
And not by sight
If things go wrong
It'll be alright
'Cause someone greater is watching over me
My God cares too much to say
His mercies are new every day
I get down to pray
And then help is on it's way
Now in faith I believe
That I've got everything I need
I walk by faith and not by what I see
I've got friends in high places
I've got someone I can call
I've got someone watching over me

A thousand times I've failed
Still Your mercy remains
And should I stumble again
Still I'm caught in Your grace

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

My heart and my soul, I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Your will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

My heart and my soul, I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise become my embrace
To love You from the inside out

Everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame

And the cry of my heart
Is to bring You praise
From the inside out
Lord, my soul cries out

My soul cries out to You

To You, to You

If love endured that ancient cross
How precious is my Savior's blood
The beauty of heaven wrapped in my shame
The image of love upon death's frame

If having my heart was worth the pain
What joy could You see beyond the grave
If love found my soul worth dying for

How wonderful, how glorious
My Savior's scars victorious
My chains are gone, my debt is paid
From death to life and grace to grace

If heaven now owns that vacant tomb
How great is the hope that lives in You
The passion that tore through hell like a rose
The promise that rolled back death and its stone

If freedom is worth the life You raised
Oh where is my sin, where is my shame?
If love paid it all to have my heart

How wonderful, how glorious
My Savior's scars victorious
My chains are gone, my debt is paid
From death to life and grace to grace

When I see that cross, I see freedom
When I see that grave, I'll see Jesus
And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace

When I see that cross, I see freedom
When I see that grave, I'll see Jesus
And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace

How my soul will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace
How my soul will sing Your praise

How wonderful, how glorious
My Savior's scars victorious
My chains are gone, my debt is paid
From death to life and grace to grace

Saved by your mercy
Found in your grace
Totally surrendered to your embrace
And there's nothing more than you

See your perfection
I'm lost in your peace
Your faithfulness sings over me
And your love is the light of my soul

And I lift my eyes to you
Creator of the world

And I stand in awe of you
Of your glory
And I live to worship you
Son of god, king of heaven

And the angels round your throne
Cry out holy
To the one who is to come
Hear us sing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Oh blessed Lamb once slain
Will reign for evermore
His hands once bound now save
Our God will never fail

He is Lord
He is Lord
Sings my soul
He is the Lord
And He lives
Yes He lives
I?m alive
Cause Jesus lives

'Tis at the cross of Christ
Where earth and heaven meet
Where sin is overcome
To God the victory

And now
Let the earth resound with praise
For our Saviour God He reigns
He is high and lifted up
Arise
For the King of glory waits
He is coming back again
He is coming back again

Come on everyone on your feet
This is good news sounds so sweet
Jesus is the Lord of all
And He will answer when you call
When Jesus rules inside your heart
That is where His Kingdom starts
Jesus is the coming King
And this is what the angels sing
He shall be called
Wonderful ,Counsellor ,Mighty God
And His mighty Kingdom
His Kingdom will never end
And He shall be called
The Prince of Peace
Justice and Righteousness
And His mighty Kingdom
His Kingdom will never end

Sing for joy at one who finds the

Fall back on everlasting arms
When all the world is swept away

Lifted for all our shame?

The scars in Your hands are for me?
You are the king of all

Lord, You came to earth
To rescue me
You took my place upon that cross

In love's embrace
My heart is overwhelmed

I shall live to glorify You God
Hear my soul rejoice

In my night never failing light
With every breath that I take

In my mind mighty Overcomer
In my soul the reason why
In my life You are the fire that calls me on

You are righteous
You love justice
And those who honour you

We walk on this narrow road
Now restored as one we walk
In Your hope
And though 
Darkness fills our path
Fear won't fix its hold on us
For we know

Love will shine before us on our path
And guide our every step within the dark

We bear tidings of Your hope
Freedom from the sinner's plight
Through Your love
Our eyes set upon this task
Truth in hand as one we walk
We advance

Love will shine before us on our path
To guide our every step within the dark
To know You is our only cry
Knowing You our only cry
Knowing You our only cry

Lord here we are with humbled hearts
To see your will be done
Let love shape us to Your own design
To bear our Maker's sign

Love will shine before us on our path
To guide our every step within the dark
To know You is our only cry
Knowing You our only cry
Knowing You our only cry

In the quiet, in the stillness
I know that You are God
In the secret of Your presence
I know there I am restored

When You call I won't refuse
Each new day again I'll choose

There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise

In the chaos, in confusion
I know You're sovereign still
In the moment of my weakness
You give me grace to do Your will

When You call I won't delay
This my song through all my days

All my delight is in You Lord
All of my hope, all of my strength
All my delight is in You Lord forever more

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Come to us, Lord
You reward those who earnestly, diligently seek You
I wanna see Your face, I wanna know Your way
Come to us, Lord

We want You more than this life
More than our way Your way is higher
Your thoughts are higher
We surrender here tonight

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Breaking down the divide in a holy collision
The Divine in disguise
Took the cross for our sin and shame
Our God You will never fail

See the lost in return
Swing the doors ever wider
See the tide as it turns
Love and mercy is on the rise

Echoing the angel cry

All the stars and the earth to existence

Yet this is all my heart was longing for
To know You my Lord

The earth cried out "Could He be the One?"
For You so loved the world
You gave Your only Son to say
I love you so
Oh how I love You so

Hallelujah to the King
Hallelujah we will sing forever

And all humanity
Aches to find this beautiful love You give
We come to You again
To offer up our lives
To worship You alone
To worship You alone

All of my days I want to praise
The wonders of Your mighty love

Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that I am
Never cease to worship You

Shout to the Lord all the Earth, let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the King

Nothing compares to the promise I have
In You

If each star was a song
And every breath of wind, praise
It would still fail by far to say
All my heart contains
I simply live, I simply live for You

As the glory of Your presence
Now fills this place
In worship, we will meet You face to face
There is nothing in this world
To which You can be compared
Glory on glory, praise upon praise
You bind the broken hearted
And save all my tears
By Your word, You set the captives free
There is nothing in this world
That You cannot do
I simply live, I simply live for You

Hide me now
Under your wings
Cover me
Within your mighty hand

When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with you above the storm
Father you are king over the flood
I will be still and know you are God

Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know his power
In quietness and trust

There is Love
That came for us
Humbled to a sinner's cross
You broke my shame and sinfulness
You rose again victorious

Faithfulness none can deny
Through the storm
And through the fire
There is truth that sets me free
Jesus Christ who lives in me

You are stronger
You are stronger
Sin is broken
You have saved me
It is written
Christ is risen
Jesus You are Lord of all

No beginning and no end
You're my hope and my defense
You came to seek and save the lost
You paid it all upon the cross

So let Your Name be lifted higher
Be lifted higher
Be lifted higher

You broke the night like the sun
And healed my heart with Your great love
Any trouble I couldn't bear
You lifted me upon Your shoulders

A love that's stronger
A love that covers sin
And takes the weight of the world

I love You
All of my hope is in You
Jesus Christ, take my life
Take all of me

You stand on mountaintops with me
With You I walk through the valleys
You gave Your only son for me
Your grace is all I rely on

I love You so
And I give up my heart to say
I need You so
My everything

Searching the world
The lost will be found
In freedom we live
As one we cry out
You carried the cross
You died and rose again
My God
I'll only ever give my all

You sent Your Son
From heaven to earth
You delivered us all
It's eternally heard
I searched for truth
And all I found was You
My God
I'll only ever give my all

Jesus we're living for Your Name
We'll never be ashamed of You
Our praise, and all we are today

Take take take it all
Take take take it all

Running to the one
Who heals the blind
Following the shining light
In Your hands
The power to save the world
My life

Or of anyone else will do

Now all I am
I lay at Your feet 
I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty

As I pray, and wait upon the Lord
I know your grace and now I am restored

As I think of all you've done for me
A mystery of your love

Who walked upon the sea?
Who lived to die for me?

You, Lord
You, Lord
You Are Lord

As I look upon who I am changed
Though I Fail Your Faithful Love Remain

As I sing and worship you found again
No Words Describe Your Love

Who watches over me?
Who's love has covered me?

You, Lord
You, Lord
You Are Lord

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Almighty One
There is none like you

There is none like you

I've confessed my hope
In the light of Your salvation
Where I lose myself
I will find You're what I need

And sing, my soul, of the Savior's love
And sing, my soul, unto God alone

I will meet You here
In the life we call surrender
Let the world I know
Be the glory of Your grace 

Sing, my soul, of the Savior's love
Sing, my soul, unto God alone
Sing, my soul, of the Savior's love
Sing, my soul, unto God alone

You alone are God, You alone are God
We declare the glory of Your name
For You alone are God, You alone are God

Reign in all the earth, reign in all the earth Jesus
Reign in all the earth, reign in all the earth Jesus

You've shown me life
You've opened my eyes
So I give You my praise
Yeah I give You my all
You've shown me life
You've opened my eyes
To the truth that there's no greater love

Now in the darkness God's light shines
Christ forever glorified
So come on come on sing out to God
Now with all we've got
We live for You our God

Salvation's strong in Christ alone
The Saviour King alone in victory
I step aside give You my life
For You to move do what You want to do

I can't imagine a life without You without You
'Cause it's all for You
Yeah it's all for You
God

On that day when I see
All that You have for me
When I see You face to face
There surrounded by Your grace

All my fears swept away
In the light of Your embrace
Where Your love is all I need
And forever I am free

Where the streets are made of gold
In Your presence healed and whole
May the songs of heaven rise to You alone

No weeping no hurt or pain no suffering
You hold me now, you hold me now
No darkness, no sick or lame no hiding
You hold me now, you hold me now

In this life I will stand
Through my joy and my pain
Knowing there's a greater day
There's a hope that never fades

When Your name is lifted high
And forever praises rise
For the glory of Your name
I'm believing for the day

When the wars and violence cease
All creation lives in peace
Let the songs of heaven rise to you alone

No weeping no hurt or pain no suffering
You hold me now, you hold me now
No darkness, no sick or lame no hiding
You hold me now, you hold me now

For eternity all my heart will give
All the glory to Your name

Chains be broken
Lives be healed
Eyes be opened
Christ is revealed

I have decided
I have resolved
To wait upon You Lord
My rock and Redeemer
Shield and reward
I'll wait upon You Lord

As surely as the sun will rise

Flood into our thirsty hearts again

We are not shaken
We are not moved

You are the love of my life
And you are the reason I'm alive
And baby baby baby
When I think of how you saved me
I go crazy

I've never known love like this
And it fills me with a new tenderness
And I know I know I know
You're in my heart you're in my soul
You're all I can't resist

And I need to tell you
The first time I held you
I knew you are the love of my life

I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
'Til you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know
Is I need you

And you are the love of my life
All the joy and tears that I cry
And baby baby baby
You don't have to say a word
I see it in your eyes

As we stand together
I promise forever
'Til the day that I die
You are the love of my life

I spent a lifetime waiting
Always hesitating until you
I was lost so deep inside my shell
'Til you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know
Is I need you

You are the love of my life
You are the reason I'm alive

You surrounded me with songs of praise
You have brought me to this place
Where Your love and grace move within my life
Now Your message is my light

Your love is beautiful
Your love is beautiful
It's the reason why I sing

All around the world
Let the praise begin
All around the world
Let the praise begin

I am planted here by the waters and
I'm living for the King
I have found my peace in the house of God
This is where I'm meant to be

Your love is beautiful
Your love is beautiful
It's the reason why I sing

All around the world
Let the praise begin
All around the world
Let the praise begin

All around the world
Let the praise begin
All around the world
Let the praise begin

 Your love is beautiful

It's the reason why I sing

All around the world
Let the praise begin
All around the world
Let the praise begin

All around the world
Let the praise begin
All around the world

Your innocence forsaken
Upon that cross
You gave Yourself for us
Carried into Your freedom

Our broken past replaced in
A second chance
The chains have come undone
Death defied in the Father?s love

We are,
Living to make Your Name high
Jesus
Living to make Your Name high
Jesus You,
Gave what the world couldn?t offer us
Say what they want, Say what they want
We are free

The atmosphere is changing,
Oh can You hear
The people rising up
In the hope of Your freedom

Our former ways are breaking
We seek Your face,
God let Your kingdom come
In our praises be lifted up

With eyes on high we praise You
And with one voice we come together
Our one desire to praise You
And lift You up in our surrender

With eyes on high we praise You
And with one voice we come together
Our one desire to praise You
And lift You up ?cause we are

Your people sing praises
Let laughter fill the world
Your people sing praises
Let love and faith be heard

Jesus came to the rescue
And where the reason He came
To come on lift up a mighty voice
Till Jesus come again

We praise the Lord with our voices
We praise the Lord with our hearts
We praise the Lord with all our strength
And everything else that we've got

We praise His with dancing
We praise His with the drums
To come on lift up Jesus' Name
Till the day He comes

Yours is the Kingdom
And the power
And the glory forever is Yours
Heaven and earth bow down
In the wonder of Your Name
Heaven is open
Death is broken
And the glory forever is Yours
Nothing can overcome
The power of Your Name

King above kings
All the universe will sing
Everlasting God
You are wonderful
You are wonderful

And the shout of the earth
Will be Your praise
God forever
And the light unto all
Will be Your wonderful Name
For the glory Lord is Yours
God forever
All the glory Lord is Yours

Jesus
We worship you lord
We love you
We love you

The greatest love that anyone could ever know
That overcame the cross and grave to find my soul
And 'til I see You face to face and grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in You

With all I am I'll live to see Your kingdom come
And in my heart I pray You'd let Your will be done
And 'til I see You face to face and grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in You

I will live to love You
I will live to bring You praise
I will live a child in awe of You

You are the voice that calls the universe to be
You are the whisper in my heart that speaks to me
And 'til I see You face to face and grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in you

You alone are God of all
You alone are worthy Lord
And with all I am my soul will bless Your name

You alone are God of all
You alone are worthy Lord
And with all I am my soul will bless Your name

The skies lay low where You are
On the earth You rest Your feet
Yet the hands that cradle the stars
Are the hands that bled for me

In a moment of glorious surrender
You were broken for all the world to see
Lifted out of the ashes
I am found in the aftermath

Freedom found in Your scars
In Your grace my life redeemed
For You chose to take the sinner's crown
As You placed Your crown on me

In that moment of glorious surrender
Was the moment You broke the chains in me

Lifted out of the ashes
I am found in the aftermath
And in that moment You opened up the heavens
To the broken the beggar and the thief
Lifted out of the wreckage
I find hope in the aftermath

And I know that You're with me
Yes I know that You're with me here
And I know Your love will light the way

Now all I have I count it all as loss
But to know You and to carry the cross
Knowing I'm found
In the light of the aftermath

I don't care what they say about me
It's all right, all right
I don't care they think about me
It's all right, they'll get it one day

I love you, I'll follow you
You are my, my life
I will read my Bible and pray
I will follow you all day

I don't care what it costs anymore
Cause you gave it all and I'm following you
I don't care what it takes anymore
No matter what happens I'm going your way

All Day
All Day now
All Day
I'll follow You

I don't care what they say about me
It's all right, all right
I don't care they think about me
It's all right, they'll get it one day

Anyone around can see
just how good you've been to me
For all my friends that don't know you
I pray that you would save them too

All for love a Father gave.. For only love could make a way... All for love the heavens cried.. For love was crucified.

Oh, how many times have I broken your heart... But still you forgive if only I ask..
And how many times have you heard me pray..Draw near to me..

Everything I need is You
My beginning and forever
Everything I need is You

Let me sing all for love.. I will join the angel song. Ever Holy is the Lord, King of Glory, King of All.

All for love a Saviour prayer.. Abba Father have your way.. Though they know not what they do.. Let the cross draw man to you

Left my fear by the side of the road
Hear you speak
Won't let go
Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray

Got every reason to be here again
Father's love that draws me in
And all my eyes want to see is a glimpse of You

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord

All I need is You forever
All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord

One more day and it's not the same
Your spirit calls my heart to sing
Drawn to the voice of my Savior once again
Where would my soul be without your Son
Gave His life to save the earth
Rest in the thought that 
You're watching over me

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord
Is You Lord

All I need is You
All I need is You Lord
Is you Lord

All I need is You you you

Did You rise the sun for me?
Or paint a million stars that I might
Know your majesty?
Is Your voice upon the wind?
Is everything I've known marked?
With my maker's fingerprints?

Breathe on me
Let me see Your face
Ever I will seek You

'Cause all You are, is all I want, always
Draw me close in Your arms
Oh God, I want to be with You

Can I feel You in the rain?
Abandon all I am to have You
Capture me again
Let the earth resound with praise
Can You hear as all creation lives
To glorify one name?

Take my life I lay it down
At the cross where I am found
All I have I give to You oh God

Take my hands and make them clean
Keep my heart in purity
That I may walk in all You have for me

Oh here I stand
Arms open wide
Oh I am Yours
And You are mine

Take my moments and my days
Let each breath that I take
Be ever only for You oh God

My whole life is Yours
I give it all
Surrendered to Your Name
And forever I will pray
Have Your way
Have Your way

In our hearts Lord
In this nation

In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed against me shall remain

I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

And this is my prayer in the harvest
When favor and providence flow
I know I'm filled to be emptied again
This seed I've received I will sow

You crossed the great divide, You took our place
You offered up Your life though we have failed
The veil was torn and love remained
You are holy Lord

Distraction costs us how we seek Your face
We offer up our lives to bring You praise
A love the walls cannot contain
You are holy Lord

We're rising up in spirit and in truth
A living sacrifice we worship You
People undivided, Lord hear us sing
We are Yours and You are our King

This is our love
Hearts joined as one
Desperate for all You are
Lord break down these walls
And see how we love
Desperate for all You are
We chase Your heart

We didn't come to leave here entertained
Or worship under any other name
We're crying out for You alone
You are holy Lord

We're rising up in spirit and in truth
A living sacrifice we worship You
People undivided, Lord hear us sing
We are Yours and You are our King

This is our love
Hearts joined as one
Desperate for all You are
Lord break down these walls
And see how we love
Desperate for all You are
We chase Your heart

Show us the way to Your heart

We found our voice
We found our cause
Were on our knees, the carpet's worn
We join our hearts
With distant shores and sing to You Lord

This is our love
Hearts joined as one
Desperate for all You are
Lord break down these walls
And see how we love
Desperate for all You are

This is our love
Hearts joined as one
Desperate for all You are
Lord break down these walls
And see how we love
Desperate for all You are
We chase Your heart

I've been running, trying to be one who sees
I've been working, salvation out on my knees
There is nothing better than knowing
That we are redeemed
Unbelieving, trusting in creative hands
I am praying for our world to bow to your plan
And this one thought is unmistakable
I take up my cross and follow you Lord

When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow
When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

Unforgiven, my savior who did not deserve death
He was blameless and I was lost in shamefulness
Undelivered, but it doesn't seem right
Unless I keep my eyes focused on the savior who gave his live
In the middle of a world that denies it believes
It is breaking apart at the very seams
There is one thing to be alive for
And it's to take up my cross and follow you Lord

When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow
When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

And I fall to my knees

I will take up my cross and follow Lord where you lead me
And I will take up my cross and follow wherever you go
I will take up my cross and follow Lord where you lead me
And I will take up my cross and follow wherever you go

When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow
When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow
When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

And I fall to my knees
I fall to my knees
I fall to my knees

I found the place called an open heart
Where loves embrace mends a broken heart
Here I will stand for all my days

I found the place called an open heart
Where loves embrace mends a broken heart
Here I will stand for all my days

Drawing closer, drawing closer
Drawing closer, drawing closer

I found the place called an open heart
Where loves embrace mends a broken heart
Here I will stand for all my days

I found the place called an open heart
Where loves embrace mends a broken heart
Here I will stand for all my days

Drawing closer, drawing closer
Drawing closer, drawing closer

Jesus, I love You, my Saviour 
Jesus, Your love it has healed me opened my heart 

Jesus, I thank You for all that You've given 
Jesus, I stand here amazed at forgiveness

Every time I close my eyes, 
Im filled with awe at all you've done 
Every time I think on You, 
Im grateful for Your Love

We come into Your presence
To sing a song to You
A song of praise and honor
For all the things You helped us through

You gave a life worth living
A life in love with You
And now I just love giving
All my praises back to You

You're the Father of creation
The risen Lamb of God
You're the One who walked away
From the empty tomb that day

And You set Your people free
With love and liberty
And I can walk with You
Every night and every day

You're the Father of creation
The risen Lamb of God
You're the One who walked away
From the empty tomb that day

And You set Your people free

Every night and every day

Cause I know that you're alive
You came to fix my broken life
And I'll sing to glorify
Your Holy name, Jesus Christ

You bought my life with the blood
That you shed on the cross
When you died for the sins of men
And you let out a cry, crucified
Now alive in me

These hands are yours
Teach them to serve 
As you please and I'll reach out
Desperate to see all the greatness of God
May my soul rest assured in you

I'll never be the same
No I'll never be the same
Cause I know that you're alive
You came to fix my broken life
And I'll sing to glorify
Your Holy name, Jesus Christ

You've changed it all
You broke down the wall
When I spoke and confessed
In you I am blessed
Now I walk in the light
In victorious sight of you

Fire fall down
Fire fall down
On us we pray
As we seek
Fire fall down
Your fire fall down
On us we pray

Show me your heart
Show me your way
Show me your glory

Since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses
Let us run, let us run with perseverance
The race marked out, let us make a way
For those who are to come, those who are to come
Every generation, every nation, every tribe, every tongue
They will sing, they will pray, that the world would sing,

Hosanna

I'll Worship at Your Throne
Whisper my own love song
With all my heart I'll sing
For You my Dad and King

To Put a smile on Your face
And when we finally meet
It'll be for eternity

And Oh how wide You open up Your arms
When I need Your love
And how far You would come
If ever I was lost
And You said that all You feel for me
Is undying love
That You showed me through the cross

I'll worship You my God

My purpose found in all that you are for me

That all of your dreams in your heart
Can come true today
Would you believe me if I said
That life could be all that you want it to be today

And if I had wings I would fly
'Cause all that I need, You are
And if the world caved in around me
To You I'd still hold on
'Cause You're all that I believe
And the one that created me
Jesus because of You I'm free

Would you believe me if I said
That God can make miracles happen today

Redemption's hill
Where Your blood was spilled
For my ransom

Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me, lead me to the cross

You were as I
Tempted and trialed
Human
The word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now you're risen

Everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost

Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me, lead me to the cross

To your heart

All I ever want is
All I ever need is You

Beautiful God
Laying Your majesty aside
You reached out in love to show me life
Lifted from darkness into light
Oh

King for a slave
Trading Your righteousness for shame
Despite all my pride and foolish ways
Caught in Your infinite embrace
Oh

And I find myself here on my knees again
Caught up in grace like an avalanche
Nothing compares to this love love love
Burning in my heart

Saviour and Friend
Breathing Your life into my heart
Your word is the lamp unto my path
Forever I'm humbled by Your love
Oh

Take my life
Take all that I am
With all that I am I will love You

Jesus how I adore You

And I find myself here on my knees again
Caught up in grace like an avalanche

Your life for all my sin
Now I stand here in
In Your grace again

Wonder how my life has changed
Wonder how Your love, it came to me

All my fears, so far away
All I hear is heaven calling me

So I look to You
So I look to You
No one else will do

Beholding Your beauty
Is all that I long for
To worship You Jesus
Is my sole desire
For this very heart

Purposed to lift Your name higher

In pure adoration
I enter Your courts
With an offering of praise
I am Your servant

Of this world ever sway me
I'll run till I finish the race

All of creation resounds with the song
Worship and praise the Lord

And this day is what we have now
In this moment we have chosen to praise
And it's changing how we live now

You're enough to save him from the pain he bore

My life is now secure

My Saviour
You'll never let me go
And in Your hands my future's brighter

Unified hear us cry at the top of our lungs
You are our God and we will not be shaken
Not afraid, not ashamed Lord we know who we are
We are your people and we won't be silent
Unified hear us cry at the top of our lungs
You are our God and we will not be shaken

Jesus, savior, in my life you are everything
My future decided, I will praise your name
And I know that I am, I am yours
Yeah, I know that I am, I am yours

Jesus, savior, in my life you are everything
My future decided, I will praise your name
And I know that I am, I am yours
Yeah, I know that I am, I am yours

I know that I am, I am yours
Yeah, I know that I am, I am yours

In the shadows my spirit weak
Love broke the darkness and lifted me
And I know you'll never let me go

In the storm in the raging sea
Love conquered the fear and delivered me
And I know you'll never let me go

Oh love in the shadows
Be the light who leads me on
You're love I will follow
Be my guide, you're will be done
Oh Lord

In the arms of the one unseen
Love carried the cross that was meant for me
And I know you'll never let me go

Oh love in the shadows
Be the light who leads me on
You're love I will follow
Be my guide, you're will be done
Oh Lord

Oh love I surrender, now forever I'll be loved
In the love of the Father, you are faithful you are strong
So hold me now, hold me now, hold me now

Nothing in this life has walked these streets
Love opened my eyes show me what you see
And I know I'll never let you go

We've got nothing to lose
We've got no reason to hide
We've got the answer inside of us
It's time we took the disguises off
Well see Your glory revealed
And see Your Name lifted high
There is nobody else for us
Jesus You are the only One

You're alive and we are free
You are everything
Everything we need

There's not a minute to waste
Not a second to lose
There's a city that waits for us
It's time we took all the lamp shades off
Well see Your glory revealed
And see Your Name lifted high
There is nobody else for us
Jesus You are the only One

Love has spoken and we believe
You are everything
Everything we need

Nothing compares to You
Nothing could ever separate us now
Your love is ours
Nothing compares to You
Nothing could ever separate us
From this love

Nothing can separate us
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can separate us now

In the quiet, in the stillness
I know that You are God
In the secret of Your presence
I know there I am restored

When You call I won't refuse
Each new day again I'll choose

There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise

In the chaos, in confusion
I know You're sovereign still
In the moment of my weakness
You give me grace to do Your will

When You call I won't delay
This my song through all my days

All my delight is in You Lord
All of my hope, all of my strength
All my delight is in You Lord forever more

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Come to us, Lord
You reward those who earnestly, diligently seek You
I wanna see Your face, I wanna know Your way
Come to us, Lord

We want You more than this life
More than our way Your way is higher
Your thoughts are higher
We surrender here tonight

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep
My faith will stand

And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and You won't start now

So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

I will call upon Your Name
Keep my eyes above the waves
My soul will rest in Your embrace
I am Yours and You are mine

God we fix our eyes on you tonight
On your cross, on your goodness, on your salvation Lord
There's nothing greater for all
That's why we worship you Lord!
Ooh, Lord!

Oh you bring hope to the hopeless
And light to those in the darkness
And death to life now I'm alive
Oh you give peace to the restless
And joy to homes that are broken
I see you now, in you I'm found

And you opened the door for me
And you laid down
Your life to set me free
All that I am will serve you Lord

Oh you fill those who are empty
And rescue those in the valley
And through it all you calm my soul
Oh now, you find me in my weakness
And heal the wounds of my heartache
I worship you in spirit and truth

And you opened the door for me
And you laid down
Your life to set me free
All that I am will serve you Lord, you Lord
And you opened my eyes to see
All the wonder and awe of Christ in me
Jesus you're everything I need, I need 

It's you I need, 
You're all I need,

I lay my life down at your feet,
'cause your the only one I need.
I took to You and You are always there

In troubled times its You I seek,
I put You first that's all I need.
I humble all I am all to You

One Way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for

You are always always there,
Every how and everywhere
Your grace abounds so deeply within me

You will never ever change,

Forever till forever meets no end

I stand before You now my Saviour
Shouting Your praise
You've changed my world and made my heart sing
And everything I have
I lay it at Your feet

Everything is different now with You my God
You broke my chains of sin
You're always there to lift me when I fall
You never let me go
Lord I give You my all

Now that I've found You everything around me is changing
Nothing will be the same
Now that You've saved me

I'll be the one to shout Your fame forever
I'll be the one to sing Your praise
My saviour
You are the strength inside of me
You are the light that let's me see
My only One

Open up the heavens
And let Your glory fall
Open up our hearts
That we would know You

The tide is turning
This is redemptions' hour
In the midst of a world lost for love
You are all we have now
The lost returning
Salvation is all around
In the midst of the world broken down
You are all we have now
For You are God and this hope is ours

So Father open the skies
Flood the earth with Your light
This is love
To break the world indifferent

Our hearts are burning
A fire that won't burn out
In the midst of a world that's grown cold
You are all we have now
The earth resounding
The anthem of your renown
As we lift up our eyes
And look to Your glory

Call us out
Let the world see
You are God
And this hope is ours
So call us out
Let the world see
You are God, as we sing

Father open the skies
Flood the earth with Your light
This is love
To break the world indifferent
As we lift up our eyes
Fill our hearts with Your fire
In a world of sin
We'll be different, the difference
So call us out
Let the world see
You are God, and this hope is ours

Our eyes are open
Every chain now broken
In this world
We are different
Let Your love become us
As we live to make You famous
In this world
We are different
So call us out
Let the world see
You are God, as we sing

Father open the skies
Flood the earth with Your light
This is love
To break the world indifferent
As we lift up our eyes
Fill our hearts with Your fire
In a world of sin
We'll be different, the difference
So call us out
Let the world see
You are God, One and only
In this world
You are all we have now

Your faithfullness endures always
Where mountains fall and reason fails
And You calm the raging seas
And You calm the storms in me, again

All I know is I find rest in You
All I know is I find rest in You

My heart will praise throughout the night
Where singing seems a sacrifice
Your grace is all I need
Your grace is all I need

My life is a light for Your cause
My will laid aside for Your call
And reserved are the depths of my heart
Only for You

I'm caught in the rhythms of grace
They overcome all of my ways
Realigning each step everyday
To live for Your glory

There's none beside You God
There's none beside You God

You're there in the dark of the night
While holding the sun and it's light
Through the triumph and trials alike
There's no-one beside You

Your voice called the stars by their name
'Cause You whispered them all to their place
To testify to Your wonder and praise
Both now and forever

There's none beside You God
There's none beside You God
I love my life to shine Your light
'Cause there's none beside You God

No eye has seen
No ear has heard
The depths of Your love, Lord
No mind can fathom
The love You deserve
How great You are

God above all the world in motion
God above all my hopes and fears
And I don't care what the world throws at me now
I'm gonna be alright

Hear the sounds of the generations
Making loud our freedom song
All in all that the world would know Your name
It's gonna be alright

Cause I know my God saved the day
And I know His word never fails
And I know my God made a way for me
Salvation is here

Salvation is here
Salvation is here and He lives in me
Salvation is here
Salvation that died just to set me free
Salvation is here
Salvation is here and He lives in me
Salvation is here
Cause You are alive and You live in me

And now the weak say I have strength
By the spirit of power that raised Christ from the dead
And now the poor stand and confess
That my portion is you and I'm more than blessed

Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our king

We love you Lord, we worship you
You are our God, you alone are good

Let now your church shine as your bride
That you soar in your heart as you offered up your life
Let now the lost be welcomed home
By the saved and redeemed those adopted as your own

Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our king

We love you Lord, we worship you
You are our God, you alone are good
You asked your Son to carry this
The heavy cross, our weight of sin

I love you Lord, I worship you
Hope which was lost, now stands renewed
I give my life to honor this
The love of Christ, the savior king

Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our king, for you we sing 

(We love you Lord, we worship you
You are our God, you alone are good)

You asked your Son to carry this
The heavy cross, our weight of sin

I love you Lord, I worship you
Hope which was lost, now stands renewed
I give my life to honor this
The love of Christ, the savior king

Because the world can't take away
Your love

Found me in weakness
Broken
You came to me in kindness
And now I live

I'll give my life for you Lord
For all you've done

It is not a human right
To stand afar while broken nations dream
Open up our eyes, so blind
That we might find the mercy for the need

Hey now
Fill our hearts with your compassion
Hey now
As we hold to our confession

It is not too far a cry
Too much to try to help the least of these
Politicians should not decide if we should rise
And be your hands and feet

Singing
Hey now
Fill our hearts with your compassion
Hey now
As we hold to our confession

Whoa-oo-oh
God, be their solution
Whoa-oo-oh
We will be your hands and be your feet

Whoa-oo-oh
God, be their solution
Whoa-oo-oh
We will be your hands and be your feet

Whoa-oo-oh
God, be their solution
Whoa-oo-oh
We will be your hands and be your feet

Whoa yeah

Only you can mend the broken heart
And cause the blind to see
You erase complete the sinner's past
And set the captives free

Only you can take the widow's cry
And cause the heart to see
Be the Father to the fatherless
Our Savior and our King

We will be your hands
We will be your feet
We run this race for the least of these
In the darkest place we will be your light
We will be your light

We will be your hands
We will be your feet
We run this race for the least of these
In the darkest place we will be your light
We will be your light

Whoa-oo-oh
God, be their solution

Soon and very soon
My King is coming
Robed in righteousness
And crowned with love
When I see Him
I shall be made like Him
Soon and very soon

Soon and very soon I'll be going
To the place He has prepared for me
There my sin erased
My shame forgotten
Soon and very soon

I will be with the One I love
With unveiled face I'll see Him
There my soul will be satisfied
Soon and very soon

Soon and very soon
See the procession
The angels and the elders
'Round the throne
At His feet I'll lay my crowns
My worship
Soon and very soon

Though I have not seen Him
My heart knows Him well
Jesus Christ the Lamb
The Lord of heaven

I love You
All of my hope is in You
Jesus Christ, take my life

And takes the weight of the world

This fire burning deep inside my heart

Look to the skies, hope arise 
See His majesty revealed
More than this life there is love 
There is hope and this is real

And I don't need to see it to believe it

'Cause I can't shake 
This fire burning deep inside my heart

This life is Yours and hope is rising 
As Your glory floods our hearts

'Cause there is none that compare to You

'Cause all I want in this lifetime is You
And all i want in this whole world is you

Your Love.. Your Love

Train me in Your Holy ways oh Lord 

I love you forever 
I love you forever 
I love you forever Lord

Jesus

The greatest love that anyone could ever know
That overcame the cross and grave to find my soul
And 'til I see You face to face and grace amazing takes me home
I'll trust in You

And in my heart I pray You'd let Your will be done

The precious blood of Jesus Christ redeems
Forgiven I'm alive restored set free
Your majesty resides inside of me
Forever I believe
Forever I believe
Arrested by Your truth and righteousness
Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness
Convicted by Your spirit led by Your word
Your love will never fail
Your love will never fail

I know You gave
The word Your only Son for us
To know Your name
To live within the Saviour's love
He took my place
Knowing He'd be crucified
And You loved
You loved a people undeserving

Arrested by Your truth and righteousness
Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness
Convicted by Your spirit led by Your word
Your love will never fail
Your love will never fail

Love unfailing
Overtaking my heart
You take me in
Finding peace again
Fear is lost in all you are

And I would give the world to tell you're story 
'Cause I know that you've called me
I know that you've called me
I've lost myself for good within your promise
And I won't hide it
I won't hide it 

Jesus, I believe in You
And I would go, to the ends of the earth
To the ends of the earth
For you alone are the son of God
And all the world will see
That You are God
You are God

With all I'm holding inside
With all hopes and desires
And all the dreams that I've dreamt
With all I'm hoping to be
And all that the world will bring
And all that fails to compare.

You say You want all for me
I wouldn't have it any other way.

I've got a Saviour and He's living in me
WHOA.

I wana know
I wana know You today.

And You're the best thing that has happened to me
And the world will never take
The world will never take You away
No-one could ever take You away.

Your mercy found me,
Upon the broken road,
And lifted me beyond my failing,
Into Your glory,
My sin and shame dissolved,
And now forever Yours I'll stand.

In love never to end,
To call You more than Lord,
Glorious friend.

So I throw my life upon all You are,
'Cause I know You gave it all for me,
And when all else fades,
My soul will dance with You,
Where the love lasts forever.

Your mercy found me,
Upon the broken road,
And lifted me beyond my failing,
Into Your glory,
My sin and shame dissolved,
And now forever Yours I'll stand.

And forever I will sing,
Lord forever I will sing,
Of how You gave Your life away,
Just to save me, Lord You saved me.

With You, where the love lasts forever.

Have you ever seen the wonder
In the glimmer of first sight
As the eyes begin to open
And the blindness meets the light
If you have so say

I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living color
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light

Have you ever seen the wonder
In the air of second life
Having come out of the waters
With the old one left behind
If you have so say

I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living color
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light

I see the world in grace
I see the world in gospel
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light
I'm walking in the wonder
You're the wonder in the wild
Turning wilderness to wonder

If You have so say
I see the world in love
I see the world in freedom
I see the Jesus way
You're the wonder in the wild

I see the world Your way
And I'm not afraid to follow
I see the world Your way
And I'm not ashamed to say so
I see the Jesus way
And I'm walking in the light

I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living color
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light

Ooh, I say, I see the world in grace
I see the world in gospel
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light
I'm walking in the wonder
You're the wonder in the wild
Wilderness to wonder

Well, I say, I see the world in love
I see the world in freedom
I see the Jesus way
You're the wonder in the wild

As I pray and wait upon the Lord
I know your grace and love I am restored
As I think of all you've done for me
The mystery of your love

Who walked upon the sea
Who lived to die for me
You Lord, You Lord
You Lord, Lord

As I look upon you I am changed
And though I fail, your faithful love remains
As I sing and worship you
I find again no words describe your love

Who watches over me
Who love has covered me
You Lord, You Lord
You Lord, Lord

Hallelujah, hallelujah almighty one
There is none like you
Hallelujah, hallelujah almighty one
There is none like you
Hallelujah, hallelujah almighty one
There is none like you
Hallelujah, hallelujah almighty one
There is none like you

There is none like you

On that day when I see
All that You have for me
When I see You face to face
There surrounded by Your grace

All my fears swept away
In the light of Your embrace
Where Your love is all I need
And forever I am free

Where the streets are made of gold
In Your presence healed and whole
May the songs of heaven rise to You alone

No weeping no hurt or pain no suffering
You hold me now, you hold me now
No darkness, no sick or lame no hiding
You hold me now, you hold me now

In this life I will stand
Through my joy and my pain
Knowing there's a greater day
There's a hope that never fades

When Your name is lifted high
And forever praises rise
For the glory of Your name
I'm believing for the day

When the wars and violence cease
All creation lives in peace
Let the songs of heaven rise to you alone

No weeping no hurt or pain no suffering
You hold me now, you hold me now
No darkness, no sick or lame no hiding
You hold me now, you hold me now

For eternity all my heart will give
All the glory to Your name

What could stand before You as You chose to embrace a cross no one deserved
You took for me the weight of sin upon You when You offered Your life
As You walked the streets of men with fading strength

How could we live but not see Your sacrifice, Your glory?

You reign, You reign, over everything Lord You reign
With power and justice divine
Over everything Lord You reign

What was Your last thought as You drew Your last breath
Where the victory was Yours for us to see
And all will know the Truth as we live and brace every praise through You
Oh, Lord

How could we live but not see Your sacrifice, Your glory?

You reign, You reign, over everything Lord You reign
With power and justice divine
Over everything Lord You reign

See now the King of glory
Love of God become my calling
Father I surrender all I am to You forever

You reign, You reign, over everything Lord You reign
With power and justice divine
Over everything Lord You reign

I have decided, I have resolved
To wait upon You Lord
My rock and redeemer, shield and reward
I'll wait upon You Lord

Surely, as surely as the sun will rise
You'll come to us
Certain as the dawn appears

You'll come
Let Your glory fall as You respond to us
Spirit rain, flood into our thirsty hearts again
You'll come, you'll come

We are not shaken, we are not moved
We wait upon You Lord
Mighty deliverer, our triumph and truth
We wait upon You Lord

As surely as the sun will rise
You'll come to us
Certain as Your word endures

You'll come
Let Your glory fall as You respond to us
Spirit rain, flood into our thirsty hearts again
You'll come, you'll come

Chains be broken
Lives be healed
Eyes be opened
Christ is revealed

Chains be broken
Lives be healed
Eyes be opened
Christ is revealed

You'll come
Let Your glory fall as You respond to us
Spirit rain, flood into our thirsty hearts again
You'll come

You'll come
Let Your glory fall as You respond to us
Spirit rain, flood into my thirsty heart again
You'll come, you'll come

Your innocence forsaken
Upon that cross
You gave yourself for us
Carried into your freedom

Our broken past replaced in
A second chance
The chains have come undone
Death defied in the father's love

We are,
Living to make your name high
Jesus
Living to make your name high
Jesus you,
Gave what the world couldn't offer us
Say what they want, say what they want
We are free

The atmosphere is changing,
Oh can you hear
The people rising up
In the hope of your freedom

Our former ways are breaking
We seek your face,
God let your kingdom come
In our praises be lifted up

With eyes on high we praise you
And with one voice we come together
Our one desire to praise you
And lift you up in our surrender

With eyes on high we praise you
And with one voice we come together
Our one desire to praise you
And lift you up 'cause we are

Say His Name within the darkest hour 
And see His light illuminate our path 
The road is narrow but our gaze is set 
On the love of Christ 'til the very end 

We walk in the truth that overcame our sin 
Leaving our past and how we once had lived 
Giving our lives to see 
Your Name made known 
'Cause the love of Christ is what the world 
Needs most 

So Lord 
Lead us in the ways of Your love 
To lead a broken world to Your cross 
Lead us in the ways of Your love 

We are Yours forever 
Our lives won't be the same 
Yours forever our eyes won't turn away 
Yours forever 

We sing Your praises 'til our lungs give out 
To the hope of the world 
The One who gave us life 
Giving our lives to see 
Your Name made known 
'Cause the love of Christ is 
What the world needs most 

We are Yours forever 
Our lives won't be the same 
Yours forever our eyes won't turn away 
Yours forever our lives won't be the same 
Yours forever our eyes won't turn away 

We're living in the One who gave 
His life to see our sin erased 
We know 
We know 
Our hope is never gonna fade away
