One million bottle bags count 'em
Think they can bounce the ounce
And it get 'em
Yo black spend two hundred and eighty eight million
Sittin' there waitin' for the fizz
And don't know what the fuck it is
An oh lemme tell you 'bout shorty
He about seventeen lookin' like forty
Treats his forty dog better than his g
When he gets a big b-o-t-t-l-e
Oh he loves tha liquor
But look watch shorty get sicker
Year after year
While he's thinkin' it's beer
But it's not but he got it in his gut
So what the fuck
Yo niga what's up
Now he's hostile to a brother lookin' out
But I ain't mad I know what he about
He's just a slave to the bottle and the can
'Cause that's his man
The malt liquor man
One million bags count 'em all
Other man gets happy
Watch the killas drink eight ball
Don't know a damn thing
But his breath stinkin'
Then I ask a question you brother
What the fuck is you drinkin'
He don't know but it flow
Out the bottle in a cup
He call it gettin' fucked up
Like we ain't fucked up already
See the man they call Crazy Eddie
Liquor man with the bottle in his hand
He give the liquor man ten to begin
Wit' no change and he run
To get his brains rearranged
Serve it to the home they're able
To do without a table
Beside what's inside ain't on the label
They drink it thinkin' it's good
But they don't sell the shit in the white neighborhood
Exposin' the plan they get mad at me I understand
They're slaves to the liquor man
Back to my homeboy shorty
He can drink it down
And think nothin' about it
Pass it around and get tha forty dog buzz
At the same time
Shorty can't remember what day it was
Say I'm yellin' is fact
Genocide kickin' in yo back
How many times have you seen
A black fight a black
After drinkin' down a bottle
Or a malt liquor six-pack
Malt liquor bull
What it is is bullshit Colt
45 another gun to the brain
Who's sellin' us pain
In the hood another up to no good
Plan that's designed by the other man
But who drink it like water
One and on till the stores reorder it
Brothers cry broke but they still affordin' it
Sippin' it lick drink it down oh no
Drinkin' poison but they don't know
It used to be wine
A dollar and a dime
Same man, drink in another time
They could be hard as hell and don't give a damn
But still be a sucker to the liquor man

I come out my crib
Walk out on the block it's hot
Yo there's a black car parked on the corner hot boys
TNT be creepin', while niggas be on the side
Of the soda machine sleeping
Word up kid, they seen what you did 
In the car parked way down the block with binoculars 
That's what they got.
Helicopters parked out on the roof
Ten thousand disposable cameras taking pictures for proof
You know what this is
That all y'all, get on the wall y'all
Take your worth out ya ass in the stall y'all
Or you take a mean bad fall y'all
TNT they be playin' for keeps
Wipe you off your teeth like cavity creep.

Word is born, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?

Yo it's hot, what they got, 41 shots

Bad boys bad boys what ya gonna do
If you get caught by our mothafuckin' crew
Shot forty one only hit nineteen
They need target practice, that's what it seems to me
Ally al is sharpton dan a tack
I'ma be like ally al and fight ya back
What, do you want to go to war, you want war?
Do you want to go to war, you want war?
I'll bury all you cocka la roaches for breakfast
Shit you out and throw you in the water for the next fish
'cause I can do that shit G
F-l-a-v-o-r f-l-a-v see.
To the highest degree times three
That's what you get fuckin' with my family

Word is born, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?

Yo it's hot, what they got, forty one shots

Shootin' at OJ
Don't know if he did it
Racist motherfuckers mad 'cause they ain't with it
The police get out the car searchin' for nothin'
If you got somethin', then they got you for somethin'
That's fucked up, the way they play dirty
Lock em up in jail until he's past thirty
They don't give a fuck about you
They don't give a fuck about me
I'm past thirty three
Word is born, born is my word
I got you before my word fails
Fuck whatcha heard
I keep it real, you never catch me fakin'
When it comes down to money that's what I'm making
Don't try and take my shit yo, I know Lex yo
I'll have a fit yo
I'll turn the whole motherfuckin' block on you yo
And that leaves you with nowhere to go
Secretly by the police you was hired
You my favorite customer I didn't know you was wired
A nik on the ground, covered by my feet
Ay yo rah get the heat

Word is born, your kids miss you when your gone
But life still goes on, you think they give a fuck?

Yo it's hot, what they got, forty one shots

Can it be easy as 5 4 3 2 1 
Damn sun
Heard it was easy as
One two three
We don't control the three E's
Still we be on the plantation
And you be in trouble b
Dizzy whirls and niggerlodeons
In the nigger time
Twenty four duckin' the war
No shirt on like
Wakin' up at 3pm, no job
Ridin' around on a bike
Hair half braided
Half combed out
Smoked out
Still braggin' about
How cats gonna come up
Get that hustle on
While them babies born
Headed to the club to get more chicks , c'mon

These rhymes ain't got
The glow of your normal 
Fairy tales
As another color passes
Another brother fails
No singin' or blingin'
Freestyle wingin'
Beer can sittin' around
Waitin for highlights on ESPN
4 3 2 1 over it
Some Vince Carter dunkin on Mike, an' shit
Get yourself together
Before these feds start
Scrapin'
Heads off the street
Sendin' cats to the middle of heat
Far in the so called middle east
Somebody gotta
Communicate 
Beyond the beats

5 retail chains
Got your brains trained
To consume anything
With a bang and a boom 
Gimme room
I'm sayin'
It's a scam to pay for airplay today
But four major corps
Bought your support
Check the fine print
That CD you bought 
Sony Time Warner Universal 
Notorius BMG
No lie they just got EMI
3 radio corporations
Own all them so called
Black stations
While two TV stations
Gotcha kids waitin'
WB we be
Hatin' the fact
Every five seconds
Canned laughter
Rolls off the faces of blacks
You p 'n' you pick a nigger
To make the problem
Nigger 
As I await the one video arm
Viacom 
To get bombed
No doubt

Hit me

Going, going, gone
Now I dialed 911 a long time ago
Don't you see how late they're reacting
They only come and they come when they wanna
So get the morgue truck and embalm the goner
They don't care cause they stay paid anyway
They treat you like an ace they can't be betrayed
A no-use number with no-use people
If your life is on the line then you're dead today
Latecomers with the late coming stretcher
That's a body bag in disguise y'all, I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers cause they come to fetch ya
With an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
They are the kings cause they swing amputation
Lose your arms, your legs to them it's compilation
I can prove it to you watch the rotation
It all adds up to a fucked up situation

So get up get, get get down
911 is a joke in yo town
Get up, get, get, get down
Late 911 wears the late crown

So get up get, get get down

Get up, get, get, get down
Late 911 wears the late crown

Everyday they don't never come correct
You can ask my man right here with the broken neck
He's a witness to the job never being done
He would've been in full effect
But late 911 was a joke cause they only joking
They the token to your life when it's croaking
They need to be in a pawn shop on a
911 is a joke we don't want 'em
I call a cab cause a cab will come quicker
The doctors huddle up and call a flea flicker
Reason why I say that cause they flick you off like fleas
They be laughing at you while you're crawling on your knees
And to the strength so go the length
Thinkin' you are first when you really are tenth
You better wake up and smell the real flavor
Cause 911 is a fake life saver

So get up get, get get down
911 is a joke in yo town
Get up, get, get, get down
Late 911 wears the late crown

Yo gee
Come and get your New York Post
New York Post right here
Come on y'all
Get the bost stubost stubost
Coasta coasta New York Post
Yo New York Post don't brag or boast
Dissin' flavor when he's butter that you put on your toast
Put my address in the paper 'cause I smacked that girl
She's the mother of my kid's that I took around the world
Disagreements having scuffles when you share upon
You shouldn't try to drain subjects in a duck pond
If you're gonna tell a story about people's worries
Watch what you tell 'em 'cause they don't bring you glory
It only brings agony, ask James Cagney
He beat up on a guy when he found he was a fagney
Cagney is a favorite he is my boy
He don't jive around he's a real McCoy
Chuck D yeah, you tellin' Flav we got to let 'em know
Here's a letter to the New York Post
The worst piece of paper on the east coast
Matter of fact the whole state's forty cents
in New York City fifty cents elsewhere
It makes no goddamn sense at all
America's oldest continuously published daily piece of bullshit
Flavor Flav is the one that makes The Post money
Writers making violence in headlines funny
Tryin' to undress my past until it's naked
Post got Flavor from sellin' no records
Europe Asia to the street of New York
Flavor Flav known for his finesse talk
Do it to ya for The Post to employ me
New York Post can't destroy me
Rapper of Public Enemy, rap star beats lover
With the headline of a fucked up cover
Out the pot took plate New York Post
get your story straight motherfucker
It always seem they make our neighborhood look bad
Here's a letter to the New York Post
Ain't worth the paper it's printed on
Founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton
That is 190 years continuous of fucked up news
Yo one can play the game, two can play the game
Yo Flav read on can't forget you either Jet
Flavor Flav is your best Jet yet
My own people own the most business
Write on faith of values'ness
Should have checked with me before you wrote it
Got it from another source and quote it
Put it out like the new year bull drop
In every beauty parlor and barber shop
Flavor Flav world renown
Can't keep a man like Flavor down
Yo Jet be a good host
Don't print bull like the New York Post
Augh, looks like somebody slipped up here
Anyway here's a letter to the New York Post
Black newspaper and magazines are supposed to get the real deal 
from the source y'all
Sorry, Jet you took the info straight out of The Post
Burned us just like toast
When it comes to getting you facts straight about P.E.
Get your shit correct

We got so much soul
You can damn near see it
Spinnin' on a forty five
I've come to the conclusion
Clear the confusion
My point is to rock
Dis funky joint
Don't you know
I got tangled
In the star spangled banner
In the middle of Alabama
Or was it Tennessee or Arkansas
New York and Cali got the same
Amount of race rally's
I know they want to hang me
Straight around the neck
So I'm knockin' off the hand checks
So you can
When I say what it is
It ain't nutting but a song

Krackas, killas, kidnappas
KKK try's to blame it on the rappers
They don't count the ones
That bounce to the forty ounce
Or the runts dat get stunted
By the blunts
This time I'm gonna take it down the line
To the ones that are ready
They be holdin' it steady
When a song so wrong
So many be singin' it
Strangled tangled
Caught in a spangled
Banner got em on dat camera
Stars I'm seein' from
A beat down in a slamma'
O' say can you see
But you can't
Uncle Sammy wears the pants
Toms his bitch
When he's swingin' a switch
Rather stick da poor up
And give it to da rich
I always thought dat power
Was to the people, we the people
O say can I see we ain't people

When I pledge allegiance
I shoulda got a sticka
First grade, second grade
I shoulda just kicked a
Verse in the middle of class
Instead of singin' bout bombs
Like a dumb ass
Land of the free
Home of the brave
And hell with us niggas we slaves
That shoulda been the last line
Of a song that's wrong form to get
So when everybody stand
I sit

The red is for blood shed
The blue is for the sad ass songs
We be singin' in church 
While white man's heaven is black man's hell
The stars what we way when we
Got our ass beat
Stripes whip marks in our backs
White is for the obvious

 Yo Chuck where you at G??
I think he went upstairs why'know
 A very furious mixture of noise
What Public Enemy producer Hank Shocklee calls
music's worst nightmare

"Hey, he's a good kid"

 Air Hoodlum 
 Check check, check the elevation 

"A player, that can leap, with the best of them"

Risin up in the 'Velt, Strong Island, New York
The hood in case you did not know my base
There was a ballplayer who had all the skills
Wit the pill to pay the piper, plus all the bills
Mick his first name, Mack the awesome game
Practiced in the heat, in the rain or in pain
Mick so quick, at six foot six
Down to be picked by anyone but the Celtics
Oh what a handle could score from the floor
With people bangin on him, or even hangin on him
But what he did best, above all the rest was...

"A player that can leap, with the best of them"
"As a high school standout..."
"The skywalker himself!"
"I felt, he could do, to make this an effective basketball team"

Grades nine and ten, Mickey Mack was all that
But in class his ass sat way in the back
How I know, cause I know, I used to flow wit the bro
He didn't mind I used to read him his own headline
Cause he could not read em his school wouldn't need em
If the lines wouldn'ta went like this
Mickey Mack jumped over the candlestick
His stack was his stats but his D was still wack
Grades eleven and twelve he found the wrong clientele and all
During class, he would dribble in the hall
But never got in trouble in school, but the trouble was
It was cool if your brain was just another bubble
As long as he could score fiddy-two
Get thirty-three rebounds, fuckin around
Temas lost to him he went right through em
Division, county, state, that's three count em
Championships for a small town bro
That's bound to go pro

"He gets free, turn on the jumper, good!"
"Streak of lightning when he breaks loose..."
"We all felt in our hearts we could win this ballgame"
"They just required me to have the game that I did
I'm just... that's all I that's all I that's all I can say"
"That's all I can say"
"He hauled down fifteeen rebounds, and kept the ball away from everybody"
"Then he had a triple double!"
"A-a-a sensational player..."

SAT's didn't matter cause he was all that
You know the pat on the back
He was always in the news you gotta know what it means
It means revenue, and I'm tellin you
I saw cars and G's come to our school please
Approach Hell with the principal, where's the coach
Went to college four years wit a scholarship...
...and won the championship
But when it came to his life he didn't care...
...cause he took it to the air

"Cross and a hook, he scores, he's fouled!"
"From the far corner, breaks West and here's the jumper, good!!"
"There's the jumper, it's not gonna go, rebound batted back..."

 Air

The fall began when Mickey Mack fell
Hell ripped his kneee drafted last by personnel
Oh how he loved the game, it was fantastic
Until he was cut, and couldn't stick
Times got tighter and tighter
He had an attitude was rude, so he turned into a fighter
School wouldn't give him the job that he needed
Assistant to the assistant coach, they didn't need it
Then he resorted to a stick up kid
Ski-mask and gat, but this game he wasn't good at
And the drugs on the side
Police ambushed his ride another homicide
He was over, ghost why'know
Hometown hero, but now a zero
To those hypocrites who ripped him blind
For his skills without the will to develop his mind
Forever in the news the community views him
Only as Air Hoodlum

"I don't understand it, the kid coulda been another Jordan!"

When I'm talkin' rhyme time
To blow your mind time some say
It's nothing worse than a verse
To hear some nigger curse
They call me rude some dudes fiery attitude
Claimin' I boast and smoke
And sometimes sing the blues
I twang metal and settle
Try to never back pedal
From the power some got
To get a nigger shot
The null and void I avoid
I test the paranoid
Never had to be bad
My mama raised me mad
So what I got is hot
I love my life a lot
I'm never sad just glad
That's why I thank my dad
Once they never gave a fuck about
What I said
Now they listen and they want my head

Instead of peace the police
Just want to wreck and flex
On the kid
What I did was try to be the best
So they fingered the trigger
Figured I was a bigger nigger
And started to search
An so I headed west
Went to Cali to rally
Was for a brothers death
It was the fuzz who shot him
An not da blood or 'cause
I wondered why it was like
So I just held my mike
But in my mind I was blind
So I just tried to find
A reason we was quick
Just the way that we was
So I just stayed in the crib
Until I got a buzz

So here we go y'all
Little by little you know
We got the power
And the knowledge to move 'em
And still rock
A super song for the 'cause so 
Feel the load on your brain for the episode
And we just begun, it's number one y'all
Brother Black, the B is back
So check it out

And 'ya don't, I won't, if 'ya still, I will
Take 3 jams and hold 'em, this what I told 'em
To rock the other side, the sucker lied
Said he would shock but never tried, and so I
Took 'em away, I never stayed y'all
Called the Flavor Flav to make another record
To get played
He made a jam to get you stammed
Back to back in the place where the suckers are basin'
Whatever it takes to make it hardcore
We gonna roll it raw
That's what you but it for, c'mon
You roll in your ride, the DJ decides
To play it on the radio
The A side
He gives it a try
But never gives it a try
And the people request the best
On the be	 side

Food for the brain, beats for the feet
People on the dance floor
Never claimin' a receipt
Had a good time rockin', rollin' on the go rhyme
The rhythm supplied by the superior be	 side
They had to twist and turn and shout
Turn the jam out, getcha' ready now, c'mon
The situation put you in
To where you're sweatin' in
Hysterical B side, c'mon inside
Request the best to give a test
And never give a rest
Your guess is good as my guess
And while I'm guessin' your guessin', yo listen this is 
A DJ to play to give a lesson
And his name is Terminator X

And the sucker on the right gets cynical
'Cause the record's to the left and political
And you search the stores
Attack the racks with your claws
For the rebels without a pause
'Cause the B side
Wins again, again, again
Yo Black, some of you are all in
To make sure the crowd
Get loud wit' it on the dance floor
'Cause the B is pure sure
You never knew the crowd was this hype
But you thought we was that type
To start a riot, we ain't quiet
Kickin' a thunderstorm with a song
Why would we dare you to come along
Pump up the music, pump the sound
Once again we gonna do it like this now
And while I'm throwin', you're goin'
And you know it's time for man on a mission
To listen 'cause he's in the house
He's Terminator X

Huffed and he puffed
Huffed and he puffed
Blew tha house down
Now how dat sound
Never no never
Give up gotta gotta live up
To my name
Triple double in da rap game

Cause I ain't goin niggatronic
Smart e nuff to know I ain't bionic
Wit my main man Harry
Not Connick
Rather rap my black as of
Getcha hooked on phonics

Good e nuff to know no endo
Thru it out tha window
Along wit tha Super Nintendo

I'm a strict daddy
Got dat right
God damn right
But have a good time/Dyn-o-mite
Its just that I don't talk
That same ol crap 
Cause papa got a brand new
Bag fulla rap 

The world don't work no more no more
The world wont work no more
Ain't gonna woek no more no more

Verse II

My main knick knack paddy wack
C'mon & give a damn
Confrontational man
Iz what I am
Iz what I am
I'm tearin down da house that Jack built
Cause he killt whoever he wanted & hunted
And tax the backs of the environment macks
Who plan in da silence of the skams
A world dat wont work
No more/no more

Mother earth gets treated like a whore
And he doeth great wonders
So that he maketh fire come
Down from heaven on the earth
In sight of men

Toms to the left of me
Bombin to the right
World good night
He got destruction
In his appetite

On a platter a planet
To him it doesn't matter
3-2 at the plate
Up go the greedy batter

Environmental alarm
To all not some
Good God
Cause we don't get two of em

I was told that oil & water don't mix
But the new world order
Got a disorder
& so I diss
Cuss my disgust
If I must
One earth is da birth outta all of us
And so I diss
After the math
Disaster wit a European autograph

I.

Gonna be bedlam
If he spread em
Da trigga is cocked
Nowhere to flock

II.

Gonna be bedlam
If he spread em
Pass da word
F what you heard

III.

Gonna be bedlam
If he spread em
Glock is cocked
Now drop da props
Gonna be bedlam
If we spread em
The day the whole world couldn't do it

Repent
Oh no!
Check the preacher what he spent
One way ticket to God to fix scars
Woman & man runnin the land sea & air poor
Do we all go the way of the dinosaur? or
To hell & back attack
The new clear fog got us sniffin like
Atomic dogs
Pocket fulla pimp daddy moves
Put a code on a can
Whatta hell of a man, shootin
Trigga pollution, planet prostitution
Uprootin da third
We go to the way of the bird
Can't do whatcha want to da place
Don't waste my place
Where you from?
We only got one

I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun, to be another one
Public enemy servin' time, they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime, never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize, what its a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up, word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from one to ten
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it y'all
'Cause time and time again time
They got me servin' to those and to them
I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a see-O
Sleepin' on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a C-O
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin', I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent,
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with Oliver's neck
I had to get off, my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nothin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out, to the ghetto, no sell out
6 see-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who want to get nice?
I had six C-O's, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by fifty two brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't, come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets, flew up
Blew up, who shot
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher that the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon
53 brothers on the run, and we are gone

Played in Cincinnati
With my whole head nappy
Made a rally in the street
With nothin' but a beat
Gotta grudge against a judge
Kick em out that seat
You are what you eat
So what you eatin'
Same message to your mind
Be self defeatin'
Sick 'n' tired of bein' sick
And tired of bein' beaten
Saw em drop it like it 
Was way too hot and too fast
For hip hop doo wop rock or bop
Ain't here to hurt you
Don't hang in them circles
Government ain't got me
Yet so y'all don't stop me
See a stampede of fake cats
Runnin' from Bill Cosby
What does he gotta do with you doin' you?
Y'all know what?
Dj lord gimme that cut
Bring that beat back
That's whats up

Gotta think outta this
Box of hard knocks
Lined em up at Fort Knox
To die in Iraq
You don't know I rock?
What you under a rock?
Old cats beggin' us to bring that beat back
Each generation thinks
The next one is wack
Jumpstarted in the daze of crack
Rand Reagan, daddy bush
Way the hell on back
Pray to god
Feel like I got a church in myself, good god uh
Cant get no help
I say again health care cutback
Shit is wack
Bring that beat back 

They say the youth don't matter
And the old don't mind
It takes a lotta spine
To build all them young minds

Some of us get ghetto at the wrong damn time
Album what? we just makin' one at a time
To save another brother whose life on the line
A big shot to claim some rocks and shine
Signs of a soul gone solo 
Robbed blind
A very small part of half the worlds crime
Runaway child blown by an old land mine
Little ones workin' in diamond mines

So cats can say whats hers and whats mine
Diamonds is girls best friend 
So whys he cryin'

See when y'all hear it get near it
And you recognize the lyrics
You trained to refrain
And you start to fear it
Escapism
Like today there ain't racism
Obviously y'all ain't see
Black folks on tv
Judgment calls 
Made on behalf of you and me
Or you and I
Do or die
I say an I for an I
Dividin' line
Got the poor people 
Payin' for crime
Corporations gettin' paid off our jail time
Now y'all can tell Russell
Yes I knock the hustle
Cause 2 million in lock down
Under federal muscle
Beyond the streets 
These kids is always watchin'
Watching some of these jerks when they go berserk
So I work

Bass! How low can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The uncannable D, Public Enemy Number One
Five-O said, "Freeze!" and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I never really had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun
Now they got me in a cell cause my records, they sell
Cause a brother like me said, "Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you wanna do is follow for now"
Power of the people, say
"Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical"
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again

Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

Never badder than bad cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats and the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside
Music that the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters
Mow, cause the country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait
Till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this

Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Making a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run-DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on its feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B. and LL as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

From coast to coast, so you can stop being like a comatose
"Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast toast"
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last. Why you ask?
Roll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as
We got to plead the Fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got the Flavor, Terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah, I'm telling you

Uh, your bad self
Help me break this down from off the shelf
Here's a music servin' you so use it
Papa's got a brand new funk
Get down 
Huh, let's get it on
Like we said before
They say the brothers causin' trouble
Hate to bust their bubble
'Cause we rumble
From our lower level
To condition your condition

That you never heard before
Make you all jump along to the education
Brothers gonna work it out
And stop chasin'
Brothers, brothers gonna work it out

You got it what it takes
Go get it where you want it?
Come get it get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street are willing to work it out

So many of us in limbo
How to get it on, it's quite simple
Three stones from the sun
We need a piece of this rock
Our goal indestructible soul
Answers to this quizzin'
To the Brothers in the streetSchools and the prisons
History shouldn't be a mystery
Our stories real history
Not his story
We gonna work it one day
Till we all get paid
The right way in full, no bull
Talkin', no walkin', drivin', arrivin' in style
Soon you'll see what I'm talkin' 'bout
'Cause one day
The brothers gonna work it out
Brothers, brothers gonna work it out

You got it  what it takes
Go get it where you want it?
Come get it get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street
Are willing to work it out
Let's get it on we are willin'
Let's get it on, let's get it on  we are willin'
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on  we are willin'

Now we are ready if you are ready

In 1995, you'll twist to this
As you raise your fist to the music
United we stand, yes divided we fall
Together we can stand tall
Brothers that try to work it out
They get mad, revolt, revise, realize
They're super bad
Small chance a smart brother's
Gonna be a victim of his own circumstance
Sabotaged, Shellshocked, rocked and ruled
Day in the life of a fool
Like I said before to live it low
Life take you time, time yo go slow
Look here, not a thing to fear
Brother to brother not another as sincere
Teach a man how to be father
To never tell a woman he can't bother
You can't say you don't know
What I'm talkin' 'bout
But one day  brothers gonna work it out

You got it  what it takes
Go get it  where you want it?
Come get it  get involved
'Cause the brothers in the street
Are willing to work it out

Let's get it on we are willin'
Let's get it on, let's get it on  we are willin'
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on  we are willin'
Now we are ready if you are ready

Burn Hollywood burn I smell a riot
Goin' on first htey're guilty now they're gone
Yeah I'll check out a movie
But it'll take a black one to move me
Get me the hell away from this TV
All this news and views are beneath me
Cause all I hear about is shots ringin' out
So I rather kick some slang out
All right fellas let's go hand out
Hollywood or would they not
Make us all look bad like I know they had
But some things I'll never forget yeah
So step and fetch this shit
For all the years we looked like clowns
The joke is over smell the smoke from all around
Burn Hollywood burn

Ice cube is down with the P
Now every single bitch wanna see me
Big daddy is smooth word to mother
Let's check out a flick that exploits the color
Roamin' through Hollywood late at night
Red and blue lights what a common sight
Pulled to the curb gettin' played like a sucker
Don't fight the power  the mother fucker

As I walk the streets of Hollywood boulevard
Thinin' how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portrayin' the roles
Of butlers and maids slaves and hoes
Many intelligent black men seemed to look uncivilized
When on the screen
Like a guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation, what else can a nigga do
And black women in this profession
As for playin' a lawyer, out of the question
For what they play aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So let's make our own movies like spike lee
Cause the roles being offered don't strike me
There's nothing that the black man could use to earn
Burn Hollywood burn

I'm countin' down to the day deservin'
Fittin' for a king
I'm waitin' for the time when I can
Get to Arizona
'Cause my money's spent on
The goddamn rent
Neither party is mine not the
Jackass or the elephant
twenty thousand nig niggy nigas in the corner
Of the cell block but they come
From California
Population none in the desert and sun
Wit' a gun cracker
Runnin' things under his thumb
Starin' hard at the postcards
Isn't it odd and unique?
Seein' people smile wild in the heat
120 degree
'Cause I want to be free
What's a smilin' fact
When the whole state's racist
Why want a holiday F--k it 'cause I want to
So what if I celebrate it standin' on a corner
I ain't drinkin' no 40
I B thinkin' time wit' a nine
Until we get some land
Call me the trigger man
Looki lookin' for the governor
Huh he ain't lovin' ya
But here to trouble ya
He's rubbin' ya wrong
Get the point come along

An he can get to the joint
I urinated on the state
While I was kickin' this song
Yeah, he appear to be fair
The cracker over there
He try to keep it yesteryear
The good ol' days
The same ol' ways
That kept us dyin'
Yes, you me myself and I'ndeed
What he need is a nosebleed
Read between the lines
Then you see the lie
Politically planned
But understand that's all she wrote
When we see the real side
That hide behind the vote
They can't understand why he the man
I'm singin' 'bout a king
They don't like it
When I decide to mike it
Wait I'm waitin' for the date
For the man who demands respect
'Cause he was great c'mon
I'm on the one mission
To get a politician
To honor or he's a gonner
By the time I get to Arizona

I got twenty five days to do it
If a wall in the sky
Just watch me go through it
'Cause I gotta do what I gotta do
PE number one
Gets the job done
When it's done and over
Was because I drove'er
through all the static
Not stick but automatic
That's the way it is
He gotta get his
Talin' MLK
Gonna find a way
Make the state pay
Lookin' for the day
Hard as it seems
This ain't no damn dream
Gotta know what I mean
It's team against team
Catch the light beam
So I pray
I pray everyday
I do and praise jah the maker
Lookin' for culture
I got but not here
From jah maker
Pushin' and shakin' the structure
Bringin' down the babylon
Hearin' the sucker
That make it hard for the brown
The hard Boulova
I need now
More than ever now
Who's sittin' on my freedah'
Opressor people beater
Piece of the pick
We picked a piece
Of land that we deservin' now
Reparation a piece of the nation
And damn he got the nerve
Another nigga they say and classify
We want too much
My peep plus the whole nine is mine
Don't think I even double dutch
Here's a brother my attitude hit 'em
Hang 'em high
Blowin' up the 90s started tickin' eighty six
When the blind get a mind
Better start and earn while we sing it
Now
There will be the day we know those down and who will go

Runnin' for your life, by the knife
Runnin' from your wife yipes
You should've stuck with home
Your mind to blow your dome
It was you that chose your due
You built a maze you can't get through
I tried to help you all I can
Now I can't do nothin' for you man

I can't do nothin' for ya man
You got all these people on your back now
I can't do nothin' for ya man
Flavor flav got problems of his own
I can't do nothin' for you man

Go lean on shells answer man
I can't do nothin' for ya man
You jumped out of the jelly into a jam

Make ya love the wrong instead of right
Not a thief cat burglar through the night
cop told your girl her name was Shirl
About a rooftop crime to steal her pearls
Oozy down the bullets in the gun

Just microwave themselves a ton
The you tried to help them all they can
But they couldn't do nothin' for ya man

I can't do nothin' for ya man
They couldn't do nothin' for ya man

Flavor Flav is the sun
Public Enemy number one
Gotcha runnin' from the gun 
Of a brain that weighs a ton
Can't face my facts that's on the shelf
Cause you want a hand out for your wealth
Eatin' welfare turkey out of the can
I can't do nothin' for ya man

I can't do nothin' for ya man
You want six dollars for what?
I can't do nothin' for ya man
You better man kiss my but
I can't do nothin' for ya man
I'm busy tryin' to do for me
I can't do nothin' for ya man
That's the way the ball bounces gee

Bass for your face, kick that shit

Today we are together, we are unified and on runnin' cower
When we are together we got power
That is why we gathered today, celebratin' our own

We spit flows on foes 
Listen to the message that you never know 
Got a plan for the man and it's federal 
The rhyme animal, back to play the part again 
Clear the madness, and put the message in 
D, the enemy is back to rip the mic 
We come together, so don't believe the hype 
Check my tone, there's a war here at home 
We united and strong, and never move alone 

We rep justice, equality and freedom now 
Put fam first, man, woman and child 
Never mild, keep it hostile 'til we raise 
Where we say, what we mean and we mean what we say 
It's been a long time comin' that we mob as one 
Guerrilla funk, hard truth nigga, that's what's up 
No peace on the street 'til the justice come 
From the ballot to the bullet, if it's on, it's on 

I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
See, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
Believe, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
That's real talk on the one 

Yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm a target, I got proof
My buildin' got an 'x' on it 
Bloomberg threw the hex on it
It's like a pistol with effects on it 
On a nigga with arrest warrants 
Hittin' pigs in their chests quadrant where they vest wasn't 
Now he dead cousin 
All you snitches hit the red buttons, we some uncle-tom killers 
Mini-nina concealers, political cap-peelers for this freedom for rilla 

Yo, if police stop the whip you got to eat them trees 
I ain't got no 'g' to give it to them crackers and court fees 
You know my steez, security first, prepare for the worst 
Never caught slippin' if you stay on alert 
Malcolm x said send them to the cemetery if they touch you 
A revolutionary virtue, a dull blade'll hurt you 
I'm up early workin' my machete 
In war, it ain't no warning, you just got to be ready 

I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My nigga, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My nigga, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
You see, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me, yeah, uha

Yeah, my nigga it's bigger than rap
You really think you gon' be left alone 
On sayin' that you believe and ain't gon' have to get your scrap on? 
Then yap on, and will see if that's the right route 
While I get my clap on and turn niggas' lights out 
I tried to be nice, now we gon' have to bleed them 
I'm willin' to do a killin' for the price of freedom "that's right"
comin' from the left, nigga, hood is how we kept it "right"
So prison or death is just somethin' I done accepted 
So we'll murder a snake, and we'll kill a skunk "that's right"
This ain't the word of a fake, it's guerrilla funk 
So right now is the time and you turf the location 
Y'all about to see the rebirth of a nation 
Even if some got de-rebelized 
The revolution still will not be televised 
you.s. government tellin' hell of lies 
And it's evident, when you look in this president's devil eyes 

I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
Yeah, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
No homie, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me
My brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me
They gon' have to pop me to stop me

That's real talk on the one 

That is why, I challenged you now
To stand together, raise your fists together
And engage in our national black messiness
Do it courage and determination 
I am, "I am", somebody "somebody"
I am, "I am", somebody "somebody"
I live in poor "I live in poor"
But I am, "but I am" somebody "somebody"
I need your welfare "I need your welfare"
But I am, "I am" somebody "somebody"
I'm maybe your seal "I'm maybe your seal"
But I am, "but I am" somebody "somebody"
I am "I am" black "black" beautiful "beautiful" raw "raw"
I must be effective "I must be effective"
I must be protected " I must be protected"
What time is it? "unification"
When we stand together, what time is it?
When we say no more ?? what time is it?
What time is it?
What time is it?

Bass in your face
Not an eight track
Gettin' it good to the wood
So the people
Give you some a dat
Reactin' to the fax
That I kick and it stick
And it stay around
Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
Goin', goin', gettin' to the roots
Ain't givin' it up
So turn me loose
But then again I got a story
That's harder than the hardcore
Cost of the holocaust
I'm talin' 'bout the one still goin' on
I know
Where I'm from, not dum diddie dum
From the base motherland
The place of the drum
Invaded by the wack diddie wack
Fooled the black, left us faded
King and chief probably had a big beef
Because of dat now I grit my teeth
So here's a song to the strong
'Bout a shake of a snake
And the smile went along with dat
Can't truss it
Kickin' wicked rhymes
Like a fortune teller
'Cause the wickedness done by Jack
Where everybody at
Divided and sold
For liquor and the gold
Smacked in the back
For the other man to mack
Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory
Little Rock where they be
Dockin' this boat
No hope I'm shackled
Plus gang tackled
By the other hand swingin' the rope
Wearin' red, white and blue Jack and his crew
The guy's authorized beat down for the brown
Man to the man, each one so it teach one
Born to terrorize sisters and every brother
One love who said it
I know Whodini sang it
But the hater taught hate
That's why we gang bang it
Beware of the hand
When it's comin' from the left
I ain't trippin' just watch ya step
Can't truss it
An I judge everyone, one by the one
Look here come the judge
Watch it here he come now
I can only guess what's happ'nin'
Years ago he woulda been
The ships captain
Gettin' me bruised on a cruise
What I got to lose, lost all contact
Got me layin' on my back
Rollin' in my own leftover
When I roll over, I roll over in somebody else's
Ninety fuckin' days on a slave ship
Count 'em fallin' off two, three, four hun'ed at a time
Blood in the wood and it's mine
I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain
Like my brain bein' chained
Still gotta give it what I got
But it's hot in the day, cold in the night
But I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive
Attitude boils up inside
And that ain't it 
Still I pray to get my hands 'round
The neck of the man wit' the whip
Three months pass, they brand a label on my ass
To signify
Owned
I'm on the microphone
Sayin' 1555
How I'm livin'
We been livin' here
Livin' ain't the word
I been givin'
Haven't got
Classify us in the have-nots
Fightin' haves
'Cause it's all about money
When it comes to Armageddon
Mean I'm getting mine
Here I am turn it over Sam
427 to the year
Do you understand
That's why it's hard
For the black to love the land
Once again
Bass in your face
Not an eight track
Gettin' it good to the wood
So the people
Give you some a dat
Reactin' to the fax
That I kick and it stick
And it stay around
Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
Goin', goin', gettin' to the roots
Ain't givin' it up
So turn me loose
But then again I got a story
That's harder than the hardcore
Cost of the holocaust

And the smile went along with dat
Can't truss it

Caught, now in court 'cause I stole a beat
This is a sampling sport
But I'm giving it a new name
What you hear is mine
P.E. you know the time
Now, what in the heaven does a jury know about hell
If I took it, but but they just look at me
Like, hey I'm on a mission
I'm talkin' 'bout conditions
Ain't right sittin' like dynamite
Gonna blow you up and it just might
Blow up the bench and
Judge, the courtroom plus I gotta mention
This court is dismissed when I grab the mike
Yo Flave
What is this?

Get hyped, c'mon we gotta
Gather around, gotcha
Mail from the courts and jail
Claims I stole the beats that I rail
Look at how I'm livin' like
And they're gonna check the mike, right? Sike
Look at how I'm livin' now, lower than low
What a sucker know
I found this mineral that I call a beat
I paid zero
I packed my load 'cause it's better than gold
People don't ask the price, but its sold
They say that I sample, but they should
Sample this my bit bull
We ain't goin' for this
They say that I stole this
Can I get a witness?

Understand where we're goin'
Then listen to this, plus my Roland
Comin' from way down below
Rebound c'mon boost up the stereo
Snakes in the morning
Wake up, scared afraid of my warning
They claim that I'm violent
Now I choose to be silent
Can I get a witness?

C'mon get wit' it
Something ain't right, I got to admit it
Made me mad when I was on tour
That I declared war on black radio
They say that I planned this
On the radio most of you will demand this
Won't be on a play list
Bust the way that I say this: No Sell Out

You singers are spineless
As you sing your senseless songs to the mindless
Your general subject love is minimal
Its sex for profit
Scream that I sample
For example, Tom you ran to the federal
Court in U.S. it don't mean you
Yeah, 'cause they fronted on you
The posses ready, Terminator X yes he's ready
The S1Ws, Griff are you ready?

They say that I stole this
I rebel with a raised fist, can we get a witness?

Um lampin', um lampin', um cole cole lampin'

People runnin' on empty
Rock the sympte
Outside two thousand and one
Other side of the sun

Running, here we go tumblin'
Few solutions, honey they polluted the future
Got me thinking of a new thing
Revolver-lution
Computer souls, controlled by confusion
You be clubbin', while the world around you crumblin'
Think its funny? Bunch of crash test dumy's
If all this shit, means the end of my money,
This is a stick up, off go the pagers and celly's
Us dollar, ain't worth what it's printed on, 
Backed by the pentagon, sounds like babylon, 
So I babble on, some of us stuck 
In them barbershops and them hair salons, 
While the crash comin' at your ass 
While the crash comin' at your ass like a bomb.

Now it all comes tumblin, runnin' 
Time is runnin' runnin' crash is coming, 
Break the bank, spinning since the beginning, 
Now it all comes tumblin, crumblin 
Time is runnin' runnin' crash is coming, 
Break the bank, spinning since the beginning,
Willie dynamite, time to cry and no ice.
Y2k, fallin out of the sky, so its chosen
Your ice is frozen, don't cry dry your eye 
Ain't this a bitch, fuckin' glitch. Mother fucker what
The count down to my account, count it down 
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, hush make that head bust. 
Last hour no control tower 
Making new may flowers, fightin' new powers 
Have you forgotten, the other side of rotten, 
Picking electronic cotton diggin' digital ditches, 
Lookout, lookout for the crash crash crash 

Have you forgotten, have your forgotten

Y2K, that's the question, 
What the fuck is up got the eighty five guessin', 
I told y'all for y'all protection
Got me a name change, a pair of smith an wessuns
Starring crescents mad packed with the lessons, 
Figure 5 percent got the 10 counting blessings 
Programmed by programs got you bowing to the man. 
Avoid collisions in mid-air, medicaid and welfare
Zero zero what the fuck do you care? 
All the lights be out, you can't get nowhere. 
All around, that's why I found tony brown
The world we know, it's going down down down down

Stax of wax 55 high fulla tracks
New cats jackin' beats from way back
Pay for play only way to get them platinum plaques
Clear the racks jobbers slobbin' you for tax
Robbery A and R snobbery
Shit is killin' me softly with that same damn song
Makin' folk dumber in the summer
A bumer when they shot Willie in that Hummer
Keep it simple stupid means numbers
Payola dough white owned black radio
Runnin' on empty help go the desperado
So I bomb the toms and negros who pray to cash flow
No info to the masses as they shake their asses
No clue but I can't get my shit up in to you

Crayola with that same same ol' shit
Crayola with that played playa shit
Crayola with that kid crayon shit
Crayola with them ol' spray on hits

All fucked up ways must fall
Now the industry can't stop me
A vendetta to make the whole game better
They get the cheddar
All I got is a fuckin' letter
What I owe? What am I
Another number and a ho, they don't know
Time to see em go like dominoes
About time 'cause they endorsed the crime up in the rhyme
Got these new souls controlled goin' outta their mind
Missed what I said 'cause they don't even own their own heads
Go one go all I forgot they made robots outta some of y'all
Today all fucked up ways must fall
Today is up against the wall
Misled in the head fucked by quiet storms and love songs
Noddin' heads too hollow forgotten tomorrow
Swallowing all that shit that's shallow
Give the baby anything the baby wants
But that's how them bastards get us up in them caskets
Try to get me where they want me
Before some of them jump me
Go tell em I'm a start a rebellion
Educate the felons easy on yeah
Tell em what the fuck am I yellin'
No tellin' you got them artists and artificials
If it ain't right I don't give a damn if it's sellin'
Recruits chasin' and racin' for that loot
Usin' usual drum loops so I salute my troops
I don't socialize or mingle, fuck the promotionals
And you know what and that g-damn single
And the marketing team for that matter
It don't matter
DJ's gettin' dimes for time on a platter
I ain't gotta be high to jack so I hijack
Fm, radio, eff em turn it around mothafucka'
Gods to niggas, queens to bitches
Race against time see em all runnin' for the riches
Everything had its chance last dance
Some things change like them weather forecasts
Ha funny how shit don't last

Crayola with that same same ol' shit
Crayola with that played playa shit
Crayola with that kid crayon shit
Crayola with them ol' spray on hits

Kill 
Time is running out 
Prophecy is a mean thing 
The prophets are together 
No one will be permitted to get in this area 
Except by special pass issued by state or military prop 
The year of our lord two thousand
Hysteria of music 
The war will become a single machine 
Then is a story about what happened and why 
The explosion the explosion
Then is a story about what happened and why 
Four three two one
Kill 
The terrifying future 
The terrifying future 

This century

I'm keepin' a cool head
Smart and calculated
Tell da skinheads what I said and they hate it
One dumb move they make
A mistake a turnover/going going gone
And its over
Shoulda thought silly rabbit
Those habits'll getcha
Runnin' whitcha life
So what some sucker snuck inside a knife
But I'm checkin' it out
Back from a far you know
They'll never know I'm backin' up
An jettin' to my car

Before they steal it
Watch me ride an wheel it
Ooh! child here it comes now
I can feel it
Inspiration from the situation
Flowing to what I know an 

This ain't nothin' but another
Headline statistic, two brothers
But one went ballistic
Now I'm chillin' beside my ride
Pulled over the side
Five-O ran a check
Now how the hell am I suspect

Now what sound of my d.j cuts
Terminators back on some ol' fools track
Takes a nation of sellouts to keep us back
Flippin' disco raps used to be whack

Now what you hear is what you lack
Take a lil' bit of this a lil' bit of dat
Who dropped the bomb on hip hop
Who got biggie and who shot tupac

What's forgot ain't no easy, no Scott Larock
Now what's rap gotta do with what you got
For whom the bell tolls
Is that the way the story goes 

85% believing all the videos
God knows who controls the radios
Some people chose the road to be hoes
And so I rose in the middle of all the woes

And def jam Negros turnin' up their nose
There's one way in no way out
No doubt the body count
Gettin' headz checkin' out

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

Time to make life shine again like glass
Gotta make it shine like glass

Outraged against the scene
Proofread the script
Flipped it back so I'm back in gang green
We interrupt this routine I had a dream

Da clean protein smacked the gangsta lean
Between the triple team
Wiped em out like a drought
Damn I'm raps tetracycline

Them lips foretold these apocalypse
Everything had a shot
And got hit with bullshit
Twisted politics tricks I couldn't get wit

As one quits another nitwit hits
All the way crazy, shady 
World turned upside down
I put it down 

Why destroy what you love 
Look around 
Surrounded by chalk marks on the ground
Where the lost got found

Why it all come tumblin' down
Why he and she gotta die
Now how dat sound

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

On and on to the break a dawn
Some the 100 meter dash I'm the marathon
Been around a long time
But the rhyme the same

Sound remains insane
Exchange the reign
Ain't that somethin'
Figure I smashed the pumpkin

So I parallel the brains of Cobain
Show no shame like the pain of Kane
Gettin' mad opposition hip to the game
It's that gran ol' pe ammo

Different time different channel
Funky piano
Here to witness get on up with a quickness
S1's in the house

With the thickness that get dis
One two three four five attackin' they frat
Griff is back got five on it black
The track got x on the decks

Terminators back 'cause a dat is whack
On the one and two
Yeah go flavor
Pe hit the road gettin' set to explode

Fight the power for peace
Can't forget the war mode
Overload
There she blows

Here we go
Now you know 
Damn another Alamo

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin' this down

Back
Caught you lookin' for the same thing
It's a new thing, check out this I bring
Uh Oh the roll below the level
'Cause I'm livin' low next to the bass, c'mon
Turn up the radio
They claim that I'm a criminal
By now I wonder how
Some people never know
The enemy could be their friend, guardian
I'm not a hooligan
I rock the party and
Clear all the madness, I'm not a racist
Preach to teach to all
'Cause some they never had this
Number one, not born to run
About the gun
I wasn't licensed to have one
The minute they see me, fear me
I'm the epitome, a public enemy
Used, abused without clues
I refused to blow a fuse
They even had it on the news
Don't believe the hype

Yes
Was the start of my last jam
So here it is again, another def jam
But since I gave you all a little something
That we knew you lacked
They still consider me a new jack
All the critics you can hang 'em
I'll hold the rope
But they hope to the pope
And pray it ain't dope
The follower of Farrakhan
Don't tell me that you understand
Until you hear the man
The book of the new school rap game
Writers treat me like Coltrane, insane
Yes to them, but to me I'm a different kind
We're brothers of the same mind, unblind
Caught in the middle and
Not surrenderin'
I don't rhyme for the sake of of riddlin'
Some claim that I'm a smuggler
Some say I never heard of 'ya
A rap burglar, false media
We don't need it do we?
It's fake that's what it be to 'ya, dig me?
Don't believe the hype

Don't believe the hype, its a sequel
As an equal, can I get this through to you
My 98's boomin' with a trunk of funk
All the jealous punks can't stop the dunk
Comin' from the school of hard knocks
Some perpetrate, they drink Clorox
Attack the black, 'cause I know they lack exact
The cold facts, and still they try to Xerox
Leader of the new school, uncool
Never played the fool, just made the rules
Remember there's a need to get alarmed
Again I said I was a timebomb
In the daytime the radio's scared of me
'Cause I'm mad, plus I'm the enemy
They can't c'mon and play with me in primetime
'Cause I know the time, plus I'm gettin' mine
I get on the mix late in the night
They know I'm livin' right, so here go the mike, sike
Before I let it go, don't rush my show
You try to reach and grab and get elbowed
Word to herb, yo if you can't swing this
Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
As you get up and dance at the LQ
When some deny it, defy if I swing bolos
Then they clear the lane I go solo
The meaning of all of that
Some media is the whack
You believe it's true, it blows me through the roof
Suckers, liars get me a shovel
Some writers I know are damn devils
For them I say don't believe the hype
Yo Chuck, they must be on a pipe, right?
Their pens and pads I'll snatch
'Cause I've had it
I'm not an addict fiendin' for static
I'll see their tape recoreder and grab it
No, you can't have it back silly rabbit
I'm going' to my media assassin
Harry Allen, I gotta ask him
Yo Harry, you're a writer, are we that type?
Don't believe the hype
I got flavor and all those things you know
Yeah boy, part two bum rush and show
Yo Griff, get the green black red and
Gold down countdown to Armageddon
88 you wait the S1Ws will
Rock the hard jams, treat it like a seminar
Teach the bourgeois, and rock the boulevard
Some sau I'm negative
But they're not positive
But what I got to give
The media says this

YOU SEE EM DOUBLED, TRIPLED SOCIETY GOT IN LINE
THE SAME THING / SAME TIME
BLIND STATE OF MIND
CANT CHANGE THE CHANNEL IN THEM BRAINS
GOT EM ALL IN CHAINS
NOW A DAys ,THE LATEST CRAZE
TO GET EM IN A DAZE
SAME OL WAYS

PROGRAMMED BY THE MAN
ON AN ON FOLLOW, HOLLOW
TILL IT PAST TOMMORROW
SEE EM FEAR IT
DONT GET NEAR IT
COMPREHEND THE LYRICS
IN PLACE SEE THEIR FACES
THEY DONT EVEN HEAR IT

DO IT, DO IT , DO IT, DO IT, DO IT, DO IT
doin the Electric Slave

SOMEBODY
DO EVERYBODY GOT LOBOTOMYS?
IM KEEPIN MY MIND AS A PART OF ME
SEE EM ALL SAVIN ENDS IN SEPTEMBER
SEE EM ALL SPEND THEM ALLIN DECEMBER
CREDIT BE THAT GREAT PRETENDER
AM I BROKE I CANT REMEMBER
BEYOND THE CLUB
CHAMPAGNE TO THE MEMBRANE
VOTE THE SAME NAME
IN THE SAME CAMPAIGN
EITHER OR
KICK DOWN THE DOOR
DONT BE A WHORE THE TRANCE FLOOR

The eastern world, it is explodin'
Violence flarin' and bullets loadin'
You're old enough to kill, but not for votin'
And that Jordan River has bodies floatin'

But you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction

Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say
Can't you feel the fears that I'm feelin' today'
If the button is pushed there's no runnin' away
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave
Take a look around ya boy, it's bound to scare ya boy

But you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction

My blood's so mad, it feels like coagulatin'
I'm sitting here just contemplatin'
You can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation
And a handful of senators can't pass legislation
And marches alone can't bring integration
When human respect is disintegratin'
Now this whole crazy world is just too frustratin'

But you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction

People I hate, that's understood
It will make stuff hard to under
Was feeling blooded to human race
If you win your war it's the same old place

The poundin' drums, the pride and disgrace
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace
Hate your next-door neighbor, but don't forget to say grace

But tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of

But tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction

You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction
You don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction
Yeah, you don't believe
We're on the eve of destruction

Man you ain't gotta
Worry 'bout a thing
'Bout your daughter
Nah she ain't my type

Are you afraid of the mix of Black and White
We're livin' in a land where
The law say the mixing of race
Makes the blood impure
She's a woman I'm a man
But by the look on your face
See ya can't stand it

Man calm your ass down, don't get mad
I don't your sista'

Would you still love her
Or would you dismiss her
What is pure?  Who is pure?
Is it European state of being, I'm not sure
If the whole world was to come
through peace and love
Then what would we made of?

Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know white comes from Black
No need to be confused

Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of Black from White
Influence who you choose?

Man c'mon now, I don't want your wife
Stop screamin' it's not the end of your life

What's wrong with some color in your family tree
I don't know

I'm just a rhyme sayer
Skins protected 'gainst the ozone layers
Breakdown 2001
Might be best to be Black
Or just Brown countdown

I've been wonderin' why
People livin' in fear
Of my shade

I'm not the one that's runnin'
But they got me one the run
Treat me like I have a gun
All I got is genes and chromosomes
Consider me Black to the bone
All I want is peace and love
On this planet

Excuse us for the news
You might not be amused
But did you know White comes from Black
No need to be confused

Excuse us for the news
I question those accused
Why is this fear of Black from White
Influence who you choose?

Yet our best trained, best educated, best equipped, best prepared troops refuse to fight 
As a matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch than fight

1989 the number another summer 
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hitting your heart 'cause I know you got soul

Listen if you're missing y'all
Swinging while I'm singing
Giving whatcha getting
Knowing what I know
While the Black bands sweatin'
And the rhythm rhymes rollin'
Got to give us what we want 
Gotta give us what we need 
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death
We got to fight the powers that be

Lemme hear you say
Fight the power 
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
We've got to fight the powers that be

As the rhythm designed to bounce
What counts is that the rhymes
Designed to fill your mind
Now that you've realized the pride's arrived
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough
From the heart
It's a start, a work of art
To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange
People, people we are the same
No we're not the same
'Cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless
You say what is this?
My beloved let's get down to business
Mental self defensive fitness
 bum rush the show
You gotta go for what you know
To make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be

Lemme hear you say
Fight the power 
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
We've got to fight the powers that be

Fight the power 
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
We've got to fight the powers that be

Elvis was a hero to most but he
Elvis was a hero to most
Elvis was a hero to most
But he never meant shit to me you see
Straight up racist that sucker was
Simple and plain
Mother fuck him and John Wayne
'Cause I'm Black and I'm proud
I'm ready and hyped plus I'm amped
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps
Sample a look back you look and find
Nothing but rednecks for four hundred years if you check
Don't worry be happy
Was a number one jam
Damn if I say it you can slap me right here
 let's get this party started right
Right on, c'mon
What we got to say 
Power to the people no delay
Make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be

Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
We've got to fight the powers that be

What have we got to say? 
Fight the power 
What have we got to say? 
Fight the power 
What have we got to say? 
Fight the power 
What have we got to say? 
Fight the power 

Yo check this out man
OK talk to me about the future of Public Enemy
The future of Public Enemy gotta

First the sheep next the shepherd
Chuck's run amok multiplying like leopards
Spots em up the long bombs a record
A long shot three minutes fifteen seconds
If I was cloned never would I be alone
Just the two of us motherfuck the Lexus
Strange fruit be hangin' in Texas
Rope be holdin the necks
Poison politics affects us
Get my flow on a show of flexes
Got too much love above
For the battle of the sexes
Now I won't go as far as romancin' myself
Or dancin' with wolves or runnin' with the bulls
Shit I be in two places at one time
Split spaces with one rhyme
Get three nickels outta one dime

First the sheep next the shepherd

Fill generation gaps with mad raps
Get slapped 
Give four smacks the hell on back 
Be the father son and the holy ghost 
As I represent both the east and the west coasts
Whatever that's worth three sixty
The planet earth that's the whole black man's turf
Now I be the rational national 
Ever present international
Spy with the third eye against the conquer and divide 
Now with three of me I can run a country 
Make apocalypse quit do mad shit on the side
I go on with my bad self if I had four of myself 
I would sacrifice two to get that slave outta you 
In my eyes be the anger of the furious five
Flashbacks cut across psycho tracks
Been there done that and I swung a big bat 
Like that there it is I be the startin' six pack 

First the sheep next the shepherd 

The east to the west south to the north 
The music might switch the rhymes never fall off
Non alcoholic avoiding the bomb 
In abortion clinics I be the hero up in it 
Jack the cracker dat did it
Now the magnificent seven
Hip hop gangsta rappin' 
Holdin' it down makin' it happen
From Oakland to Manhattan 
If I was eight I be damn great
City to city state to state
Won't never be too much on my plate
Flow like Watergate
With nine of mine 
I'd get piece of mine
Again and again
With that power of ten men 
Duplicated by the split
Of one mean gene an shit
Back to the lab
With them scientific crabs, what next?
Three  minutes and fifteen seconds

Um lampin', um lampin', um cole cole lampin'
I got loowies boy, um not trampin
I just came from da-crib ya know
Um on da go-throw ya tank into metro
Live lyrics from the bank of reality
I kick da fliest dope maneuver technicality
To a dope track, you wanna hike git out ya backpack
Um in my flav-mobile cole lampin
I took dis g upstate cole lampin
Ta da poke-a-nose, we call da hide-a-ways
A pack of franks and a big bag of Frito Lays

Flavor-flav on a hype tip
Um ya hype drink, come take a big sip
Um in position, you can't play me out da pocket
I'll take da dopest beat you got and I'll rock-it
Like chocolate, even vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, saperella
Flavors are electric, try me, get a shock-a
Didn't I tell you to leave flavor flav alone knock-a
A clock on my chest proves I don't fess
I'm a clock-a, rock-a rockin' wit-da-rest
Flavor in da house by chuck-d's side
Chuck got da flavor-flav don't hide
P.e. crazy, crazy p.e., makin' crazy loowies for the shoppin' spree

Ya eatin' death 'cause ya like gettin' dirt from da graveyard,
Ya put gravy on it
Den ya pick ya teeth with tomb stone chips
And casket cover clips, dead women hips ya do da bump with, bones
Nutin but love bones
Life styles of the live-en-dead
First ya live den ya dead, died trying ta clock what I said
Now I got a murder rap 'cause I bust ya cap with flavor, pure
Flavor

We got magnum brown, shoothki, valoothki
Super-calafraga-hestik-alagoothki
You could put dat in ya don't know what I said book
Took-look-yuk-duk-wuk
Shinavative ill factors by da flavor flav
Come an ride da flavor wave
In any year on any givin' day
What a brova know, what do flavor say
Why do dis record play dat way
Prime time merrily in da day
Right now dis radio station is busy, brain knowledgeably wizzy
Honey drippers, you say you got it
You ain't got no flavor and I can prove it
Flavor flav the flav all of flavors
Onion an garlic french fried potatas
Make ya breath stink, breath fire
Makes any onion da best crier

I know it sounds crazy but it fits perfect
Peter perfect pimped a perfect peter
Honey dripper, sucker sipper, big dipper, sucker dipper
Drippin' suckers like it's goin' out-a-style
Creatin' flavors for da flavor flav pile
Lampin' booyee madina style

Kickin' da flavor gittin' busy
Ya goin' out, I think ya dizzy
I think ya hungry, 'cause ya starvin' fa flavor
Flavor most, put it on toast
Eat it-en taste it en swallow it down
Imperial flavor gives you da crown
Of the king called flavor, da king of all flavors
Rolls an rolls an rolls life savers
Flavor flav is in everything ya eat 'cause everything ya eat got
Flavor
Flavor flav is da first taste ya git in da mornin,
Ya breakfast is da flavor
In between dat ta lunch, in between dat dinner,
In between dat ta midnight flavor
Yeah, das right I got somethin fa all da fandangoes of damangoes of
Da fandangoes of da mangoes

Hey yo, Chuck, yo the world if sleepin', G
We got to wake everybody up yo
Hey yo, it's goin' down, baby
Let everybody know how it's goin' down, baby

The way this goes down is simple, from this day forth
Anything to deal with rap, stay off
It's just the players, no pay offs, strictly skills 
If you're brain's the same you'll stick to your deals
And this field ain't about sellin' a mil'
With the run of the mill, so just be tellin' the real
It ain't like a third time fella's appeal
'Til the GOD scolds him and tells him to deal
I'll allow you to write, maybe allow you to bite
If you're down to fight the power here's the power to fight
Overpower the mic, hit the crowd with the bomb diggy
Ring the alarm, now the squads with me
From way back I show now weakness when I speak this
Mentally strong to keep this hit in my speeches given
Now listen from the beginnin' 'til I reach the endin'
My short stories winnin' and keep the beats spinnin'

You know the name, P.E.!
You know the game, P.E.!
We ain't for the game
We for the change
I wake up everyday with my game face on
You know the name, P.E.!
You know the name, P.E.! 
Yeah we ain't  for the fame
We for the change
I wake up everyday with my game face on

Break harder than ever, follow my lead
Through the fast lane in the game, they follow my speed
Either ease off the gas or floor it
You ain't ready to get it, I dunno why they keep askin' for it
This the real P.E., ain't no castin' for it
Cop lights, news camera, no action for it
Get the uncut raw, we somewhat sure
Hip hop's like a chess game, discussin' the war
Strategize, move like masterminds
When it's your go and your do', just cash mine
Last time we welcomed y'all to the Terrordome
Used the mic to reach out and touch, instead of the phone
I appear from the rear, stayin' from clear
Nobody can say if I'm here so they play it by ear
But here's the way I lay the idea
From this point on, the rest of '98, put it in high gear

I saw it comin', premeditated world domination hesitated
Rough this nuclear war head, detonate it
I'm forbidden, so I stay hittin' up forgiven
For givin' the livin' the truth, 360 proof
So world look before this world's took
I curl books under my arm
Smoke charm and learn about this world's ?
Revelation the world cooks
I spit gold versus the pearl hooks
The first album made the world crooks
Got 'em snatchin', robbin', thievin', stealin' ideas
Believe in pleadin' reason for treason, conceal it for years
My criminal ? attract an accomplice to grub something
Results drastic measures
And the death of joy, the death of casket treasure
From the abyss, the greatest trick I played on the world
Was leadin' them to believe my mother's clit didn't exist
Then I extended the list
Revolutioned every flag raised by a clenchin' fist

Yeah that's right, once again
Smooth the Hustler, and he ain't no crowd buster
Straight up Iceberg Slim
Yo, baby, you need to get with him
Flava Flav, Chuck D, Public Enemy, Smooth the Hustle
We out the backdoor, baby

I was wheelin' wit' the boom in the back
The treble was level, I like it like that
I was rolly-roll-a-roll rollin'
At 5 O looked and said, ?Hold it?

And I stopped still, I never got ill
'Cause my license was clean an I showed
A peace powwow, instead of pow pow
I'm straight up and I'm straight, so how you like me now

But I know how you do, you're straight from Babylon
But I know how you do, you're straight from Babylon
They said, ?Turn it down? 'cause it's a new law
You never seen us before but we're raw like a war

They warned me once, they warned me twice
So I knew I was warned they had it goin' on
I got the f*** outta Dodge wit' my Bronco
A 60 miles an hour, 

And I be pumpin' the sound drownin' out the cars
Which tape should I rock, L.L.'s or R.A.'s?
I'm in the streets of New York, go away
I pop in my cool G Rap 'n' Polo tape

And they was at it again, sirens in the air
Ah sh**, so I'm outta here
But the blue in the front called the blue in the back
They cut me off and stopped me dead in my tracks

But this is minimal, I'm not a criminal
I always did what I did because I'm not a kid
And I looked around, they stared me down
Told me what I did, I ain't wit' it

'Cause word around town was a stickup
Yeah, yeah, yeah, be-boy n**** in a pickup
But I was jeepin' and creepin', just a keepin'
It down sound, here we go the run around

I'm blamin' me for the hardcore roar
But they the ones wit' the 44's
I'm just coolin' I know the beat is rulin'
Too loud for the crowd the bass is large, yeah

So I'll get the f*** outta Dodge
That's right y'all, el commando
El commando you're in demand-o

Sgt. Hawkes and I'm down wit' the cop scene
I'm a rookie and I'm rollin' wit' a swat team
Packin' a nine, can't wait to use it
Crooked cop yeah, that's my music

Up against the wall don't gimme no lip son
A bank is robbed and you fit the description
And I ain't your mama and I ain't your pops
Keep your music down or you might get shot

This is a warning so watch your tail
Or I'm a have to put your a** in jail
I'm the police and I'm in charge
You don't like it, get the f*** outta Dodge

Now whats goin' on
I don't know
Whats really goin' down
Y'all don't know
Between the east and the feds
Heads don't know
But you can bet 
Some of these heads be the first to go
Between eighteen and thirty
Pray it don't get dirty
Now I got some new cats 
Hearin' me
That never heard me
Eleven thirty do the math
Damn, here come the draft
But I'm at an age my fightin' is half ass
Shee, my flags always at half mast
Need you ask
While some of y'all laugh
But I see war lining these young cats
Up for body bags
And these so called thugs masquerading in drag
Cause now the feds checkin' all dem head rags
Hopin' this gung ho thing last
Cold and dark is the weather
Peoples, get yor sh*t together

Ain't even gonna fix my mouth to say chickens
Told y'all in terror dome the clocks tickin'
From all sides come the wicked
Governments
Fundamentalists
But how you gonna
Kill the innocent?
Between terrorists 
And CIA hit lists
Like my man uno says
Beware the false prophets
Gotta be smarter than this
They say war is a profit
With loved ones missed
But death is a debt
None of us ain't seen war yet
Be careful what you ask for
War is hell and hell is war
All them bling bling thangs throw em in the river
All that thugged out sh*t y'all cant deliver
Seen four planes kill everyday folks
Guess 911 ain't no joke
Wall street cryin' broke
Was it god
Or the devil itself
Who spoke?
Old vampires
Hit the new empire
Had the sky cookin'
Brooklyn had no other choice 
But to stare and keep lookin'
City smile
Missin' two front teeth
While some of y'all 
Still talkin' them little ass beefs
Over who, what SoundScanned

This month you sound scared
Guessin' where the party at?
While downtowns wonderin'
Where the bodies at?

How you sell soul to a souless people
Who sold their soul?
Keep the people from bein' sheeple
Followin'
Hollow voices
To tommorrow's sorrow
Women have nurtured
And birthed the earth
Man has killed many
For land and worse
Women got a cycle that's spoken for
Man has a period, its called war
May the power go to
Everyday people
May war have no sequel, live 
Reverse the word you get evil
Cause people wanna live against evil
Avoid the third world war
Biological bombs
A hundred times worse than Vietnam
So what you gonna do?
If you was on that plane 
Both sides would've killed you too
To my peoples
Stay on your P's and Q's
Get your sh*t together

The monkey ain't no joke
So you want to mess with the coke
Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy
The monkey ain't no joke
You better leave 'em alone
He's home grown, he's the cyclone
He's the moan groan, Capone, the clone
The broken bone, tone

You've got to get off my back
We got the real Flavor Flav
Gettin' down with the sound
And he's tellin' you to get off his back

He's on your back gives you no slack
Don't give me no flack, because I know
Toe to toe, go to go
He's on my back
Get off my back

Aslam a lakem
And that's the way we take 'em
And if we got to frisk you down
Then that's the way we shake 'em

Chuck D, Flavor Flav

Aight , aight, aight , aight 
I'm aight if you aight 
I be better, get some of that bass
 aight, yeah

(Rinkin' twinkin' body shakin'
Nuff attackin' brain's a rackin'
Clock tockin' Chuck shockin'
Flavor Flav ain't never shavin')

It's another record, check it, mad methods
To put my brothers and sisters on a deathbed
You know he cheated, took what he wanted but now you blunted
Suckin' up to the devil steppin' down a level
It's who they fear is you
Who protects us from us and you from you
Yes and it counts 
I sued them bastards, yeah they got bounce
I did em like a demo 
I took a 98 'cause I never liked a limo
But pump pump pump pu-pump pump it up
A mad rhyme, for mad times, that's what's up
Some ain't gonna change, I got em in a range
I gotta rearrange, so I'm buildin' back your brain
Wreckin' records with funky stuff
Am I loud enough?  You got ta give it up

Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

Yeah
You gots ta give it up now

Come again with the same old bounce
I'm calling a foul and once again it counts
Mad tense mad tense brothers know
The blunts in the back got the black behind and that's wack

Hey Jimmy cracked corn cracker singin' "I don't care", it's on
I'm comin' with a rhyme  I'm lettin' go a rhyme 
I gotta get a rhyme through the rough and crazy times
Call me a Hannibal lecture, yes I checked her
They don't hear me though, so here I go
I'm sick and tired so Sly'll take ya higher
When I'm takin' his sound to bring you down
Rappers rippin' a lyrical kickin' finger-lickin'
But to the rhythm I'm givin' but never cotton pickin'
Like James Brown I'm sayin' it loud
Am I loud enough? Huh, you got ta give it up

(Some ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change
Some ain't gonna never ever change
Some ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change
Some ain't gonna never ever change!)

Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo

And when I'm coming, some young dumb and fulla cum
Some second guessing my lessons about saving young
Some don't know like Run said so here we go
Where it is inside, whoop there it is
 There it is
(There it is, damn right
My man X is a bad mother 
I'm talking about Terminator, he's the man)
There it is, can you hit me off with another one

Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

I never did represent doing dumb shit
Some gangsta lying, I'd rather dis Presidents
Dead or alive, bring em and I'll swing em
I vocalize, I just rap, I don't sing em
Flick em, and I fling em, you can go with em
Hall of Fame for the game for the points I Dave Bing em
Go Grandmama, close but no cigar
I got mine, for I'm using my rhyme
The flow go wherever I want, and that's clever
Give a piece of my time, to prevent some crime
And who behind puttin'' the guns to the young ones
The ones that make em is the ones that take em
Rugged for no reason, down in duck season
I don't want my mama, on the street wearing armor
So check ya'self before ya wreck ya'self
Respect ya'self, hah, you got ta give it up

Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

Say it takes two to tango
But a crew to bang, yo
Superstar shootout 
Overtime at Durango

Clear out the box out
Practice at the range, yo
Get the D to step back
Unless they be deranged, dough

Rae me fa so la ti dough
The chiza rarely do missa
Money earner isa
Barn burner

Highlighted by the headturner
Every step you take
Televised by Ted Turner
TBS and TNT

Sunday drain the tray
But drew the foul on NBC
Ain't no stoppin me
I told y'all

I close the door on the series
Swept but they ain't here me
In case you forgot
This shot is hot

Boo you
Like Stuart on the Scott
Haves and have not
Go cat go

Let the legend grow
Game it like you game it
Better let em all know

One for the chiza
Two for the flow
Three to get the heads ready
Go cat go
Go cat go

Go cat go
High and down low
Do it like you did
On the brother with the fro

Good job baby
Get the crowd crazy
Put that finger up at the section ladies
Scream come on scream

At the chisa and the cream
Raised up in Brooklyn
But be ballin' down in Queens
White man's burden

Be a black man's dream
Badge over troubled green
Be a triple team
Suits and ties

See the envy in the eyes
Controllin' guys while the 
Buyers lie about the size
High priced Adonises

Unkept promises
Boxscore forgets all the no name threats
Puttin'' numbers up
To get them numbers up

Keep bouncin'
But who's countin'?

One for the chiza
Two for the flow
Three to get the heads ready
Go cat go
Go cat go

Go cat go
High and down low
Do like you did
On the brother 
With the fro

Go cat go
Let the legend grow
Game it like you game it
Better let em all know

Go cat go
Let a player know
Coney Island style
Before you go pro

Are you ready?
Uptown, on the corner, uptown
Uptown on the corner, uptown
I turn around and hear the sound of voices talkin bout who's goin to die next
Cause the white man's got a God complex
Tellin niggas screamin for help 
Nigga go make your own help
Shit you need it
I turn around and hear the sound of jukeboxes playin in bars
Pimps parked outside in big pretty Flavor Flav cars
Cleaner than a broke dick dog
Sittin in a big fine frog
Dressed very fine and fly in their Calvin Kani
No matter how you flex
Yo Jim
They'll die next
Cause the white man's got a God complex
Uptown on the corner, uptown 
Hey brother what you sport my man
I got just the thing for you
Only cause you're 10 and 2
What ya gonna do baby
I got black ones
Brown ones
Red ones
Yellow ones

If you want to buy some

So I ain't no way the kid is gonna get took
Nigga what you mean

Nigga
Lick the ice 
Now 7
Come on be nice and hit 11
Well what do you know
It's lil Joe
Ey my man
Got twenty dollars eh lil Joe don't blow
Ah baby needs a new pair of shoes
Ah pappas got the funky blues
Ah mamma plays the crosswords in the news
Sorry nigga you lose
The line forms to the rear lady muther fuck your welfare check
Cause the white man's got a God complex
Uptown on the corner 
Mr. Stein elevating a friend
But is proud to be mine
But you just want to cheat me cause I ain't your kind
Damn
I'm so poor
I don't know what the hell I'ma do anymore
Not from this day to the next
Cause the white man's got a God complex

I gotta do what I gotta do 
So who the hell is you
To tell me how my song is wrong
You don't know
Layout & let the drummer go
You think my rap's about stealin'
But it's about feelin'
Sometimes drug dealin'
But few know how my flow
Don't get the proper review
I gotta do what I gotta do

Do whatcha gotta do first
Ooh
Here go da verse
I gotta do what I do best 
Kick da Nitti & Ness
The danger zone
They better leave me alone
I got posse
Lus the feds had better watch me
I picked a bone wit' Arizona
Droppin' kickin' a mission
Wit' no permission
I let 'em know why I did what I did
I got dialogue
Got 'em to even sing along
& got the semiautomatic
Tongue to da young
When there's static
They come & try to get some
They had the nerve to call the president
An' I wasn't hesitant
To scream I was a resident

So-called power of the people
Lookin' for the truth
Like guessin' my vest was never bulletproof
I'm edgin' close to the line
& it's fine time to know
Why the hell & da f---
I try to battle so
Much to touch never feedin'
A crutch to lean on me
Excuses is weak
That's why my look is mean
To the devils 'bout God
Another reason why it's comin' hard
My intellect doin' wreckin' effect
'Till it's through
Gotta do what I gotta do

I Gotta do what dey don't like
'Cause I got a mike
The more I push
& the more you learn
& dey burn, you get another turn
To take the helm recreate
The realm of leaders
Not to say you never need us
But in da mirror
You can do it, it's so easy to start
Yeah baby you can see it on
A flow chart
And just in case
They ever get me in da middle
Of things before I go
You know I'm gonna take a swang
Until dey give what dey never
Gave I refuse to be
A slave I hijacked
The airwaves
Let ya know the dirt
Swept under the rug
Give the brothers a pound
My sisters a lil' bigger hugs
My rat a tat comin' right
& exact 'cause it's true
I gotta do what I gotta do

Our society is fucked up, they're fucking our brothers and sisters up
These white motherfuckers have fucked us up...
This ain't by no goddamn accident...

Rolling Stones of the rap game, not bragging
Lips bigger than Jagger, not saggin'
Spell it backwards, I'mma leave it at that
That ain't got nothing to do with rap
Check the facts, expose those cats
Who pose as heroes and take advantage of blacks
Your government's gangster, so cut the crap
A war going on so where y'all at?
"Fight the Power" comes great responsibility
'F the Police' but who's stopping you from killing me?
Disaster, fiascos over a loop by P.E
If it's an I instead of we believing TV
Spitting riches, bitches, and this new thing about snitches
Watch them asses move as the masses switches
System dissed them but barely missed her
My sole intention to save my brothers and sisters

 Get up
Just like that
 Get up
Just like that
 Get up
Just like that
 Get up
Just like that

Screamin' gangsta 20 years later
Of course endorsed while consciousness faded
New generations believing them fables
Gangster Boogie on two turntables
Show no love so its easy to hate it
Desecrated while the coroner waited
Any given Sunday so where y'all rate it?
Wit slavery, lynching, and them drugs infiltrated
I'm like that doll Chucky, baby
Keep comin' back to live love life like I'm crazy
Keep it movin' risin' to the top
Doug Fresh clean livin' you don't stop
Revolution means change, don't look at me strange
So I can't repeat what other rappers be sayin'
You don't stand for something, you fall for anything
Harder than you think, its a beautiful thing

 Get up
Just like that
 Get up
Just like that
 Get up
Just like that
 Get up
Just like that

So it's time to leave you a preview
So you too can review what we do
20 years in this business, "How You Sell Soul?"
G-Wiz, people bear witness
Thank you for lettin' us be ourselves
So don't mind me if I repeat myself
These simple lines be good for your health
To keep them crime rhymes on the shelf
Live love life like you just don't care
Five thousand leaders never scared
"Bring the Noise," it's 'the moment they feared'
Get up! Still a beautiful idea

Throw yo hands in the air
Get up and show no fear
Get up if y'all really care
PE 20 years
Now get up

Reach uppity reach gotta reach
Power to the people & the beats
Some people accuse some people of crimes
Some people get away wit' losin' my rhyme
They don't like where I'm comin' from
So dey play dumb
Dumb diggetty dumbb diggetty dumb
But I'm tellin' you what they do
Play a fool
While the real thief cools in a pool
He who got the finger on the war button
Talkin' loud ain't sayin' nuttin
TV got 'em bigger than life
All he needs is a knife
Who's the criminal?

To the blind def & dumb
Hard to see 'em comin'
Don't be dumb diggety dumb
Politikin' writin' bad checks
Still dey gettin' wreck
Goin' fo' a nigga neck
Rollin' in a blue 'n' white gang
Ready to bang biggedy bang
Hangin' 'round da hangin' rope
Nope n-o-p-e
I ain't bendin' for the soap
Never understood why the 'hood
Half od who's in da joint
Now dey got me losin' my point
Gotta have it goin' on
Born criminal born

Take a piece of America back
But who had it first
Hear the indian curse

Robbed & stole so many so much
It ain't funny
Now who got 'em face on money

Politician passin' a bill paid in full
see-note rockin' in a pocket
How they livin' makin' sure they
Lockin' us up I got a feelin' I'm...

When it come to somethin' we say
What dey don't like is a brother like me
On da mike

In fact to the gritty ain't none of us wack
Noriega had back

Jeffrey Dahmer enter the room without cuffs

How the hell do we set stuffed
In da back of a cell
On an isle
Ain't it wild
What's a criminal?

Only if I had one more time to kick
The rhythm that keep rippin' down the door
So the real crominals get exposed behind the clothes
Doors 'n' the suits that make 'n' break da law

Lookin' for my own 'cause I had enuff bull
I can't understand it must be crooked
Way they planned it

Police supposed to keep the peace
But I can't truss 'em
So I keep my piece
Loaded & cocked
'Cause I don't miss the block
I'm talkin' about the ones who don't get chained to the rock
While we go away for the neighborhood crime
Never liked what I saw in the law
Indiana tress hangin' us instead of leaves
We hangin' the rope
Real criminals...

It might feel good 
It might sound a little somethin' 
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin' 
What is game who got game 
Where's the game in life behind the game behind the game 
I got game 
She's got game 
We got game 
They got game 
He got game 
It might feel good 
Or sound a little somethin'
But fuck the game if it ain't saying nothin' 

If man is the father the son is the center of the earth 
In the middle of the universe 
Then why is this verse coming six times rehearsed 
I don't freestyle much but write 'em like such  
Amongst times controlled by the screen 
What does it all mean all this shit I'm seeing 
Human beings screaming vocal javelins 
Sign of the local nigga unraveling 
My wonderin' got ass wonderin' 
Where Christ is in all this crisis 
Hating Satan never knew what nice is 
Check the paper while I bet on ices 
Keep more than your eye can see and ears can hear 
Year by year all the sense disappears 
Nonsense preserves prayers laced with fear 
Beware the two triple o is near 

There is something happening here 
What it is ain't exactly clear 
There's a man with a gun over there 
Tellin' me I got to beware 
It's time to stop children what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Thought of that millennium just be killing them 
It scary like lies buried in a library 
When did state pen correct anything 
When piles of us still be catchin' the bus 
When stacks of cash packed in laundromats 
Pay the preachers back where the teachers at 
I ain't even gotta ask it 
Whose underpaid and got fouled at the basket 
I can't blame the envy at who be getting all the benjis 
And taking them grants for granted 
Last I checked pyramids wasn't built like projects 
On them government checks 
Modern day thugs ain't got no guts 
Pardon the expression under governor nuts 
Last time in a church be the last time in a church 
Dead pledge allegiance to CD's and movies 
Leaving reality believing in fantasy 
Bleeding fatalities too many formalities 
Prayers laced with fear 
Beware the two trip zero is here 

Ray Nagin: 'People are dyin'. They don't have homes. They don't have jobs. The city of New Orleans will never be the same. Now get off your asses and let's do somethin'. And let's fix the biggest Goddamn crisis in the history of this country.'

Chuck D.: 'Does it gotta come down to this? In order to see things for what they are? For what it is? We still might not be free up in this piece or treated there equally as far as I can see. Now if you saw what I saw, see what I see there on the TV, it led me to write this song after talking to my father. But the anger in this song seemed to write its damn self. Hell no, we ain't all right.'

Now all these press conferences breaking news alerts
This just in while your government looks for a war to win
Flames from the blame game, names? Where do I begin?
Walls closing in get some help to my kin

Who cares? While the rest of the Bush nation stares
As the drama unfolds as we the people under the stairs
50% of this Son of a Bush nation
Is like hatin' on Haiti
And setting up assassinations

Ask Pat Robertson- quiz him... smells like terrorism
Racism in the news
Still one-sided views
Saying whites find food
Prey for the national guard who be ready to shoot
Because they be sayin' us blacks loot

New Orleans in the morning, afternoon, and night
Hell No We Ain't All Right! 

Now them fires, earthquakes, tsunamis
I don't mean to scare
Wasn't this written somewhere?
Disgraces all I see be seein' is hurtin' black faces moved out to all them far away places
Emergency state, corpses, alligators and snakes
Big difference between this haze and them diamonds on the VMAs

We better look
What's really important
All under this sun especially if you over 21
This ain't no TV show
This ain't no video
This is really real
Beyond them same ol' 'keep it real'

Quotes from them TV stars drivin' big rim cars
'Streets be floodin,' B
No matter where you at, no gas
Driving is a luxury
Urgency
Don't y'all know? This is a state of emergency
Shows somebody's government is far from reality
Somebody's government is far from reality

New Orleans in the morning, afternoon, and night
Hell No We Ain't All Right! 

Ray Nagin: 'And they don't have a clue what's goin' on down here. I'm like 'you gotta be kiddin' me'. This is a national disaster. Anyway you look at it, it's a tragedy. It's awful down here, man. God is looking down on all this, and if they are not doing everything in their power to save people, they are going to pay the price.'

Now I see here we be the new faces of refugees
Who ain't even overseas but stuck here on our knees
Forget the plasma TV ain't no electricity
New world's upside down and out of order

Shelter? Food? What's up, wheres the water?
No answers from disaster
Them masses be hurtin'
So who the fuck they call? Halliburton?
Son of a Bush, how you gonna just trust that cat?
To fix shit when all the help is stuck in Iraq?

Making war plans takin' more stands
In Afghanistan 2,000 soldiers there dyin' in the sand
But that's over there, right?
What's over here is a noise so loud
That some can't hear but on TV I know that I can see
Bunches of people lookin' just like me

New Orleans in the morning, afternoon, and night
Hell No We Ain't All Right!
Mississippi in the morning, afternoon, and night
Hell No We Ain't All Right!
Alabama in the morning, afternoon, and night
Hell No We Ain't All Right!
U.S.A. in the morning, afternoon, and night
Hell No We Ain't All Right!

Chuck D.: 'We definitely ain't all right. Now some of y'all voted for that cat. Son of a Bush. That's right. What God giveth, sometimes your country taketh away.'

Here I go, I don't give a damn if you with me
Stupidity, shit I'm the reverse of jiggy
All that prettiness running on empty
Only wusses need pity, no I ain't from the city
Five minutes of fame if you don't know my name
Oh yeah, I'm that field nigga they all fear
Here's a mad salute to all my troops
Fuck a lawyer and the law and all them suits
I spits and I vomit 'cause I come like a comet
Better quit it if y'all don't know what y'all gettin' from it
Just forget it if you with it, that racket runnin' it
Come on come with it, I think I'll fit it
Go to war but what the hell I'm fightin' for
As I soar yeah baby I like it raw
No cigar, I ran over the pop star with my car, 
Again and may the best jam win 

Here I go, there you go

Bingo, it don't matter if this platter's a single
Needin' needles like the Beatles needin' Ringo
From the beginnin' I told you how to see through the linen
All that talk but that's the way
The side walks in new york
I simplify 'cause you might be high
Rip shit in the pit so what you don't like it
This is man shit a hip hop trip
On that aggressive tip but rap got pussy whipped
Got out psyched down on that turnpike
I knew this Philly who just wouldn't get right
Cause I was aware as a square in Delaware
Execs writing checks for sex in spandex
Radios gettin' sucked by labels under the table
Mix DJ's gettin' overpaid for airplay
Try to shut me down like ray, what I say?
Fuck your friends and may the best jam win

Here I go, there you go

Mirror mirror I'm finger pointin' at the man
It is I, I interrupt the program
Chuck d rubberneckin' with the fans
PE don't give a damn about uncle Sam
And on and on like I said before 
Some, the 100 meter dash, I'm the marathon
Against the grain comin' like a train
As you listen to the sounds that remains insane
One on one and it's just begun 
To get out the ghetto and get something done
To be the man you gotta beat the man
Don't confuse me with being dumb or bubble gum
And I'll be here as you disappear
And I'll be around amongst the crowd
Cause anything I wear is a step on down
That's how I've always been
And may the best jam win

I remember when us blacks
Were on our backs
Across tracks
Where we live
Now we packin' in Cadillacs
Or Pontiac if you know
What I'm sayin'
Po' old nigg thinks it's a Caddy
And now he's playin' mack daddy
But that's all right I blame it
All on Jack
Who's Jack you ask me
You say, I say it every time
But the rhyme goes
Into your head down to your toes
And you missed me
Play it off like a diss, yo
Let's go & diss the
Wick wick wack
Wiggedy whack in fact
I'm sayin' hit the road Hack
For the hook
I'll play it by the book
For the track
I'll bring it back
Look out: Hit the road Jack

Black is black
White is white
That's all right
If you're right
That's all right
No need to fight, yo
Much respect if your nature's in check
A little
If not expect me to cock a doodle do
A riddle
Just actin' cracka proves to be a
Killer to me like I refuse to be a negro
But we grow to be people
People
But our color had 'em playin' us out
Like we was Cinderella
But if you take it & break it down
Full of noise but Jack & his boys
Keep doin' what they want to do
But hear me out
Jack goes under color
To kill one another
'Cause some blacks act devil too
And if you see him
You can tell by his act
Not his word but his deed
And we bleed all because of that
Lifestyle of a dirty rat
And if you act like that
Step back & hit the road Jack

Not Jack the Ripper
Or the jack of spades
I'm not jackin' for beats
Let's get Jack the raper
Mothers cried while forefathers died
From the whip
And not a bit ever made the paper
When I come they all
Run & hide
And they quit
And yell loud
Here he come wit' dat black s--t
I'm through wit Jack
Bein' the quarterback of the scene
He's played out like bell-bottom jeans
I took a line from the Main Source
For that
I know they feel the same
Thank you
Hit road Jack

500 years ago one man claimed
To have discovered a new world
Five centuries later we the people
Are forced to celebrate a black holocaust

How can you call a takeover
A discovery

Mass murderer
This side of the planet
Most people take it for granted
502 and still doin
Give a reason I'm hatin
October celebratin
The dead

Of the black the brown and red
Sick an tired
Of bein sick n tired
Dont jump to conclusions
Before I clear the confusion
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I'm talkin bout Columbus

Hit me one

I dont hate nobody
I hate that day
Its as crazy as Hitler day

Hangin heads and snappin necks
Splittin up kin
Makin familys wrecked
Turned this planet to a sewer
Provin to all just a lil grab
Will do ya
Or do us
So my disgust
Got credit from the ones that
Read it
Aint blind to the fact
Of a whack headline
And if you didn't I pay
No mind

That's how I feel
That's how I feel
This iz madd real

But these days
Is crazy as Hitler day

I don't hate nobody

It's impossible to discover a land
When people are already living there

Some thanks for the givin
When times are hard
& some got the nerve to pray to God
Aint about turkey
& cider that gets me sick
It's that take from the indian trick
Lookin pretty grim
When they takin da pill
From the sucker seekin somethin to kill
Now he got a day to celebrate
Aint that a trip
Cause the indians aint got shit

May 31st when it comin it hurts
Remember the dead and it makes me curse
When they dont include 100 million
Of us black folks
That died in the bottom of boats
I can carry on bout the killin till
Dusk & dawn
And war ain't the reason they gone
Fourth of July a fuckin lie
When did we ever
Get a piece of the pie
Gotta whole day comin
Without no pay
Cause a fuckin job
Cant gimme no play
Even had enuff I huff & puff
At brothers sellin the stuff
Takin in washingtons
Lincolns
Not they birthdays
Payback for em makin us slaves

Look around what do you see
Can you see what I see
Hard to live without weed
Catching hell without heed
Phenomenons phenom's prodigy's
Twenty thousand maniacs just gotta be 
Human highlight flicks
They want to be 
Hobbies turned to robberies
They killin' me
The gun didn't know I was loaded
Devil attempts to get heroes railroaded
Stole the ball from lost souls
For whom the final bell toles
Confused with Moses in street clothes
He suppose he the one with the corn rows
Blessed to do this outside j
Do you know the way to the ABA

One on one
It's just begun
Come to the house of the rising son

Not one of these programmed cats
Just off the black
Where the shot clock at
Don't back me if I with milky raps
Smack me if I rhyme on silky tracks
Takes a nation to get back
Mike sometimes the opposite of what ya like
I'm tired of the traps within
Sometimes your brain's your cell
Prison's the skin you in
Getting change beyond point blank range
Combined with the cross it's getting strange
Here comes the sun
But who's gonna stop the rain
It's just begun
And some got done
Got to beat the man
In the house of the rising son

Pusher of the button
Talkin' loud ain't sayin' nothin'
The mack of the format gettin' fat
Ain't funny 'cause my neighborhood
Is flowin' money
Thank God 4 the boulevard
They keep the motor runnin'
The rap shows coincide wit' the tape flow
Bootleggers go inside and record the record low
They get me, get this now can you freestyle
Freestyle no styles free except da radio
But the radio controlled by the sucker move
Who moved away got away after plannin' a getaway
An now he want to play what he want to play
An got say on what is bumpin' of course he's gettin' somethin'
Never know what's good to tha neighborhood
Swear I never seen da sucker
In my necka da woods
The ass is connected to the brain stem
So I sing a simple song
So you can see the sucker in 'em

People got to make a call
To hear the yes y'all 
While the phone keep ringin'
You hear some singer singin'

Why don't dey play the jammy in the daytime
People think it's slammin' plus the rhyme
Is hot an got me tunin'
The afternoon is FM in the PM
Oh if that they could see 'I'm
Out-of-towner not down I think they'll dis him
Up goes the season, pop goes the weasel
Damn gimme rap no band I want some x-clan
I know dey even got it from the giddy
Stacked in the back
Only black radio station in the city
Programmed by a sucker in a suit
Slick back hair he don't even live here
Raps the number one pick so I draft it
I don't care about all the other demographics
When the quiet storm come on I fall sleep
What dey need is Arbitron on the funky jeep
Too bad it's goin' on in fact my word is bond
To pull a disappearin' act attack until he gone
The whacker jam he play they pay I'm in da day
I don't think we gonna miss 'I'm we don't need 'I'm anyway

Can I kick it
Who the hell is on the radio
Or who's behind
Do you really think they'll mind
To play the funky jams
That everybody wit'
Some Def Jef or Ice T
Show they rollin' wit' the syndicate
Or can dey get funky
Wit' the underground
Master ace get a taste
Bomb squad gettin' hard
Marley mart makin' hipper
Trax for Jack The Ripper
Pumpin' Eric be	 or Papa San
Still rollin' wit' run
Did you think that ever
In fact you thought that never
Control of your soul
Is by a suit and tie
Then you wonder why why you never hear a rhyme
I say we do 'I'm
Till it's done

I came from a place I forgot
I woke up in a parking lot
Far from a meal and a cot
On the corner
Where all the streets got the same name
Maybe my brains on the brink of insane
Pain between the papers while sleepin' on the train
This the land of milk and honey
Know what I'm sayin'
The invisible man times three
Black, down and out
Out standing on a corner no doubt
Now a nation of homeless
Sleepin' in bus stations
Another win for the pilgrims
Who said no more Haitians
As I proceed
Someone to feed me is what I need
Through three blocks of dealers
Tryin' to hit me off wit weed
Avenue and boulevard hungry as a Motherfucker
Hope to get a ride from a trucker
Everybody know I ain't no sucker
Everyone used to drop 30 at the rucker
Away from crazy kids in generation wrecked
Dissin' pyramids while praisin' projects
Walk past old folks gettin' no respect
Callin' young folks a bunch a no good rejects
And I walk on

An eye for an eye
I can't recognize the man in the mirror
Is it I, it is I now who this cat I'm lookin' at
Cause I've been waiting so long to get where I'm goin'
An eye for a eye in this country tis of thee
Now how the hell can I be free
Who this cat I'm lookin' at
Cause I been lost so long without anybody knowin'

So I move on and I walk on
Past the preachers and the pimps gettin' their talk on
Now why do home gotta be where the negative roam
To be or not to be so I roll alone
I'm trapped within this skin and these bones
Temporary kings on cellular phones
Can I last as I walk past
Cigarette Billboards and Malt Liquor Ads
Walkin' on broken bottles and potato chip bags
Everyone I see got the nerve to brag
Where they from what they got
And don't own squat
Disrespect where they from and ya might get shot
Zombies askin' me what the latest Bomb Bay
Should shot the fuckin' sheriff and the fuckin' deputy
For OK in the drug trade and lettin' it be
But I know prison for me is an industry
So I Walk
I heard the best things in life be free
Didn't god make the land the air we breathe
Not for the homeless don't give a damn about me
In the mirror somebody else is starin' at me
Maybe prison is the skin I'm within
All this time I been sufferin' can't fix it wit a bufferin'
Plus they said I'll never work in this town again
Damn so I keep on walkin'

An eye for an eye
I can't recognize the man in the mirror
Is it I, it is I now who this cat I'm lookin' at
Cause I've been waiting so long to get where I'm goin'
An eye for an eye in this country tis of thee
Now how the hell can I be free
Who this cat I'm lookin' at
Cause I been lost so long without anybody knowin'

Lil day day is big day and just did time
Seen him standin' on the unemployment line
Which collided wit the line of the health clinic
I seen Crazy Stacy her ass standin' up in it
No more welfare cut her medicaid
Damn my mama used to do her braids
I keep walkin' so they don't see me
But I doubt if they doin' any better than me
So I walk on never take the planet for granted
I paved the concrete, asphalt and granite
I walk pastast three brothers sittin' on the porch
Wit a yard of dirt and littered wit Newports
Talkin' how they comin' up while they sittin' on their ass
As I walk past em I'm a target of their laughs
And one said lets get em for his fuckin' stash
As I walked fast past the other yards wit grass
Had a lil' cash tried to make it last
From a few deals I made from cleanin' windshields
I ran like a rally they caught me in an alley
Can't get out the ghetto from New York to Cali
I thought I had nothin' till I felt the knife
And now I ain't even got a life

Let me hear you say...

I ain't mad at all
Bought a fat jam to make you flip the script
Don't want to sleep and misbehave
Understand what I'm saying

I'm all about makin some fat louies
So I can buy my kids
Motorcycles, candybars, Peter Paul
Flavor Flave, he ain't mad at all
Boyee

Poppa's got a brand new flav so once
Again here we go 
I ain't mad at all 

What you know
What you know bout that boy?

Noodles, neon noodles
On a fifth chillin with a toy
He's chillin
Thought he had a pit bull
Eating brussel sprouts but he had a big bite
He tried to bite me
He tried to get me
I turned around and I
Hit him with my bike

They picked me up
Put me in a wagon
The bottom fell out and my ass start draggin

Who put the cuffs on Flava
Why you gonna go and do that
He's the Flavor mack 

I ain't mad at all 

Yo check out my honey hoe's
Sing that shit gee

There's a Flavor Flav
So what your girlie
Before she wanna sneak out early
Cause on the di
Flavor snatched her up

First there was superfly
But Flavor's got more style
And you can't tell because your crackin up

Let me hear you say...

Kick it

Kick it

I ain't mad at all 

I got the feeling I got to tell ya
You be a star
And the man try to jail ya
I don't pollute
So why should I give a hoot
You ask
Why you livin foul

Na na na na na na

Why they wanna keep me down?

Cause you got Flavor workin day and nite

Why you wanna play me
Like fried ice cream
Give me nightmares
Can't never have a nice dream

I feel like bustin loose
Bustin loose
Give me a break y'all

You can try to cop my style
But Flavor Flav got too much on file
Boyee

I don't wanna go but I can't stay here no more

I ain't mad at all

Yeah, yeah, yeah

You flatlinin, you flatlinin you know what I'm sayin
Who put the cuffs...

Yo! ho! yo nigga! yo nigga! no nigga!

Check it out!

How can you say to me yo my nigga
Cursin' up a storm with your finger on a trigger
Feelin' all the girls like a big gold digger
Take a small problem
Make a small problem bigger
Say yo! I ain't poor I got dough
You don't consider me your brother no more
Goddamn kilogram, how do you figure
I don't wanna be called yo nigga!

Yo nigga!

Hey!
Yo nigga!

I try to make my statements stick like flypapers
Judge says to me "yo nigga sign these goddamn papers"
My boss told me "yo nigga you're fired"
'Cause my body told me "yo nigga you're tired"
Yo nigga this, and yo nigga that
I'm your nigga now 'cause your head got fat
Flava framalama boy you won't figure
I don't wanna be called yo nigga
Yo nigga!

Break it down
N.I.G.G.E.R.
Nigga
Everybody sayin' it
Everybody playin' it
Load it on a scale
'Cause everybody's weighin' it
Toby say "yo I be good nigga"
"Nigga get a shovel nigga be good digger"
I don't care how small or bigger
I don't wanna be called yo nigga
Yo nigga

I see I'm peeking out ready to rumble
So now I'm speaking out
Against those
That flip the way the story goes
One never knows
Who be flippin' the script
Whatever the traitors name
My aim is dunk em like
I'm Chris Webber

So many phony smilin' faces
Traces of slander
Got em comin' outta funny places
I had it an hear em
talkin' loud behind my back
What was good for the hood
Is what they say is wack
I take the stabbin' and grin
When I'm hit
Cause I know the suckas smile
When I leave em
What I'm comin' wit

I can't complain about the money
Although the suckas in the back
They talkin' shit
An laughin' like its somethin' funny
I aim to make changes
An never change
Unless its for the better
Cause I always been a go better

Clean hustler
Rhyme instead of muscle ya
Born when ya thinkin' I'm gone
The terror era is on 

I stand accused
To the crews
I paid my dues

I stand accused
I refuse
To stand and lose

I stand accused
To the news
I kick da blues
I stand accused
I refuse

I hear em talkin' and walkin'
Behind my back I'm attacked
Fuck the knife in the back
Cause it feels like they got an axe

Yeah I can dig it with a shovel
I never dig dirt with the devil
Instead I'm on that other level

But I took time to reach down
To help the black and brown

I never stood around
I hear em talkin' behind
My mind
In a ocean of sharks
And a back full a hackmarks

They say I'm fallin' off
Yeah, they better call it off
and get muscle
and find another hustle quick
Sick 'n' tired of critics
But I can take a hit
I'm all man
Alley oopin the vocal on jams
But they don't know it
They can blow it

and take a puff of dis joint
I see I'm kissin' it off the cuff
Behind the back
I'm pullin' axes and blades out the arms and the legs
Still my fellas get paid
The terror era is on

Fuck a critic, fuck fuck a critic
All the fuckin' critics
Can get the did dit

All a fuckin' critic does is
Draw a fuckin' line

Cross a line and dis my rhyme
and then they ass is mine

If you find a critic dead
Remember what I said
Who killed a critic
Guess the crew did it

Say paybacks a crazy ass message
Sent to the writers who criticize
They're fuckin' with afreedom fighter

Who raises flags
and dragged the klan in bodybags
I hung em up in Mississippi and bum fuck
This is Chuck so what the hell
You think I did it for
To open doors from Carolina to Arkansas
And lemme let em I met em
I told my boys forget em
An what they did got rid of me
Negative
But ninety four got stunts and blunts in da mix
I hear the crowd fallin' vic
To old ghetto tricks
But if I wasn't your cousin
Wed leave em in the dozens
Of sellin' out and bellin' out
Half pint forty ounce
Announce to the rest
We had a fall out

I never took a drink
Never took a hit or bribe
Or got spread by what a silly
Rumor said
Never sang or gang banged
Sold out or rented hip hop
Cause I know when to stop

DJ: Public Enemy - ah, in their music ah, kinda rabble rousing.  
They, ah, talk about, ah, well things like - You know the white media has 
been very upset abou

DJ: On the air- Hello?

Caller: Yes, hello?

DJ: Yes?

Caller:  Ah, I've seen these guys - I saw them warm up for the 
Beastie Boys last year.

DJ: How were they?

Caller: How were they?  I thought it was one of the most appalling 
things I have ever seen.   There were two gentlemen in cages on either side 
of the stage wit

DJ: Hello?

PE in full effect, Brother!

DJ: Hello?

Caller: Why do you even pay homage to these people by putting these 
monkies on?

DJ: Hello? Hello?

Caller: ...then have the guts to tell him that he doesn't know what 
he's talking about.

DJ: Hello?

Caller: Terminator X!

DJ:  Thank You.  . 
On the air .  Go back to Africa?  OK, we're going to  - believe 
me when we go t

Caller:   Yes, I think that White liberals like 
yourself have difficulty understanding that Chuck's views represent the 
frustrations of the majori

DJ: I do understand that.

Caller: But before he came on, you were -

DJ: If you had read the stuff I had read about him, and the way 
he's been portrayed in American press-

I came from a place I forgot
I woke up in the parking lot, far from a meal and a cot
On the corner where all the streets got the same name
Maybe my brain's on the brink of 
Pain between the papers while sleepin' on the train
This the land of milk and honey 
The invisible man times three
Black, down and out, out standin' on a corner 
Now a nation of homeless sleepin' in bus stations
Another win for the pilgrims who said

Yeah, avenues and boulevards hungry as a 
Hope to get a ride from a 
Everybody know I ain't no 
Every time I used to drop thirty at the 
Away from the crazy kids in Generation Wrecked
Dissin' pyramids while praisin' projects

Callin' young folks a bunch a no-good rejects
And I walk on

An eye for an eye, I can't recognize the man in the mirror
Is it I? It is I
Now who this cat I'm lookin' at?
Cause I've been waitin' so long, to get where I'm goin'
An eye for a eye, in this country 'tis of thee
Now how the hell, can I be free
And who this cat I'm lookin' at?
Cause I've been lost so long without anybody knowin'

So I move on  and I walk on 
Past the preachers and the pimps gettin' their talk on 
Why do home gotta be where the negative roam
To be or not to be 
I'm trapped within, this skin and these bones
Amongst temporary kings, on cellular phones
Can I last, as I walk past
Mad cigarette billboards, and malt liquor ads

Everyone I see got the nerve to brag
Where they from, what they got, and don't own squat
Disrespect where they from and you might get shot
Zombies askin' me, what the latest bomb be

For okayin' the drug trade and lettin' it be
But I know prison for me, is an industry
So I walk, heard the best things in life be free

Not for the homeless, don't give a damn about me
In the mirror somebody else is starin' at me
Maybe prison is the skin I'm within
All this time I been sufferin' can't fix it with a Bufferin'
Plus they said I'll never work in this town again  
So I keep on walkin', yeah

Lil' DayDay is Big Day and just did time
Seen him standin' 
Which collided with the line of the health clinic
I seen Crazy Stacy, her ass standin' up in it
No more welfare, they cut her Medicaid

I keep walkin, so they don't see me
But I doubt if they doin' much better than me
So I walk on, never take the planet for granted
I paved the concrete, asphalt and granite
I walked past three brothers, sittin on the porch
With a yard of dirt, and littered with Newports
Talkin' how they comin' up while they sittin' on they ass
As I walk past 'em I'm the target of they laughs

From a few deals I made from cleanin' windshields
I ran like a  they caught me in the 
Can't get out the ghetto from New York to 
I thought I had nothin, 'til I felt the knife
And now I ain't even got a life

Crosstown traffic
Black to black
You should a seen 'er
Long and winding road to the arena
Crystal ball
I prophesized
What was on the horizon
Forewarned y'all
Is it any wonder
What kind of ground you goin' under
A September ender
To march madness remember?
You never heard a murder
Take for example
Unsolved mystery
Life lost in a funk sample
Enter the bandwagons
Braggin' hangin' banners
Clearin' the way for younger MC's
And new hammers
What was criticized six years back
Is now back
With New York on the jersey front and back
Feel like Tiger Woods
Got mad goods
Way up from the cheap seats
Comin' outta the hood
Race to the black seats
Amongst the wack seats
Be the hardcore
Alongside the deadbeats
The world lookin' on
Like spectators
At crucified gladiators
Feels like a jungle inside
Where fish swim birds fly
Man got a tendency to die
Man falls to the hands of man
But damn if I'll ever try
To survive at court side
Four tickets to fly
Rap or play ball do the game
Or duck the drive by

Same league that defends
Be the same ones that do us in
Spy's
CIA FBI
And them suits in that
Corporate sky
Eye for an eye
The target is the bad guy
Heard the war is on
From the announcer
Bound to get the crowd
Bouncin'
Yes and it counts and
In this corner representin' the
Best in the west
Died from four bullets
Two in the chest
Worshiped on the other side
Of TV sets
Had mad fans
Comin' outta both sex
Sold, multi platinum
Eight times gold
But died of homicide
Twenty five years old
Heard he died in debt too
I ain't seen a winner yet, you?
The confused crowd boos
The move shit
In that corner
Number one in the east
The peace cursed for life
By the mark of the beast
Raised by peeps rode jeeps
Deep in Brooklyn beats
Praised as a hero
Who came up off the streets
The crowd looks on
Claimin' sides they don't own
A house built up on
Their skulls and bones
Knew it be a matter of time
The play by play
Two rappers slain
Main
So let us pray

Wit all the gunnin'
Crowd goin' crazy
Gettin' bigger
Proud to be called a bunch
Bitches and niggas
The ghetto stage fulla
Field nigga goals
Hip hop shoot outs vs those house negros
Five bodies got on the shot clock
Runnin' down in the count made
The scoreboard rock
The referees the LAPD
The LVPD
Said they couldn't catch
What they couldn't see
Question
Was it bigger than the names
Not only in the game
But the game behind the game
Down to the remaining
Seconds of this record
Anatomy of a murder
Intensity of a mystery
Dead and gone
As the heads looked on
Helpless
As the atmosphere preyed on
Investigating
And the winner be
Interscope UNI Arista BMG
Lost in overtime
Da tombstone trophy for people that shit
The rhymes that died
Beats that deceased
Fuck best
Rest in peace

Rainy days from stormy nights
Though the stars shined
Days were bright
That was then this is now
That was them this is how

Rainy days from stormy nights
Though the stars shined
Days were bright
Live and die by the sword
Come playoff time
Is your lord a god
Or is your god a dog?

Start a war on the poor gettin' mad donations
Takin' cheese out of poor nations
Got Haitians still on sugar plantations
Wiped em out called it exotic vacations.
As you dig it they set up regulations
Turn the rest of the world into cancer patients.
What's the diff no buts ands or ifs 
Now I need a place to hide away.
Are you ready are you ready

Whose the real docs of death
Oh no it's doctor death

Killer man atomic b-boys in japan.
Another brother dies up in Sudan
Kevorkian got the heads lookin' for that kill em 
Dead from the feds shit man
Contaminated in sad predicaments
Blood threats, blastin' continents
Kings, queens dead presidents
Can't tell me where my chiza went.
Take em down blow the house down blaw
The evils got you wobblin' like weebles
Thinking you equal, killin' lost peoples
No sequel remember biko

Whose the real docs of death
Oh no it's doctor death

Whose the real docs of death
Killin' millions til they're last breath
Got no right to be dead ass wrong
Killin' me softly with your songs

Bring the noise 
But surrounded by cowboys
Indigenous but wiped out 
Diggin' new ditches
Can you dig it 
Turnin' tricks at the tip of politics
The devils slick, gettin' their head split
I spit at those hypocrites 
So I sticks to the music
Think about it it's god 
You better get with the scene
Keep you and I from being human beings
You deserve what you deserve, 
If you believe what he believes 
And into everything you leave. 
Oh what a tangled web you weave,
When destroyed by the disease by thirty three degrees
Bringing Satan down to his knees

All I want to do is get paid back 
For all that time I spent in the back 
Livin' in shacks fillin' up sacks of cotton 
Now it's what we fought you're makin' six packs 
There's some got our hope out of control 
Of my soul pass the Ol' Gold 
Behold the pale horse Supreme Court 
Sweatin' niggas like sports 
Hunt a nigga for sport 
See a nigga play sports no support 
On the outside lookin' in 
If that's what's up then I ain't never been in style then 
Everything is anything, anything is upbeat of nothing 
Once again, poisoned from the paper and pen 
You better defend that bullshit on the other end 
Fuck your own thing, if your own thing's the wrong thing 
Fuck dem chicken wings 
Last able man standing 
Follow what? I ain't understanding 
What's better to understand then be misunderstood? 
'cause the FBI is up to no good 
Power to the peeps who come with their own drum 
And don't end up like sheep 

Kill! Kill 'em live! 
Kill! Kill 'em live! 
Kill! Kill 'em live! 

Mad heads confused by the isms 
Bustin' caps incoginisms 
Phone taps, makin' sure they record ya 
From my midnight plane to Georgia, uh 
Ancient to ? player 
The life giver, the name take-awayer 
Propaganda can't gasp the last man standing 
Assassinate all the plannin' 
Get wreck, what you see is what you get 
To plunder more stars than Trek 
21st Century Robin Hood 
I guess the politics are robbin' hoods 
Fuck the Government 'cause you know that I would 
'Cause the FBI is up to no good 
Power to the peeps who come with their own drum 
And don't end up like sheep 

Be a bitch is a foreign crime 
Engine, engine number nine
Engineerin' monopolies, triggers and uninsured jalopy's 
Catchin' more lock than companies 
Engineerin' opinion and policies 
Herd following like sheep 
Following of the sheep will be sheep 
Based on what they heard from their peeps, uh 
Able to straddle quick beats without a battle 
Politician assassinated 
Rappers get shot, quote Chris Rock 
"To have, to have not" is the question 
Yes, them 'have nots' be robots 
All the sheeps have forgot 
The 'haves' keep the 'have nots' guessin' 
Under them Smith and Wessuns 

Mad topics, no you can't stop it
Like how much they paid for that rocket?
People in the hood really ain't got shit
How much got spent by the President?

Where my money went? livin' here separate
Even heads gotta nerve yellin' represent
Beat down cribs funky ghetto adlibs
Gadgets, value jets, half lit cigarettes, city limits

Put my whole soul in it
I been waitin' too long to get where I'm goin'
Hatas dissin' this flowin', thinkin' ball and rap
Is the greatest thing from blacks

Hype, watch a sucka run to it
Seems like a river runs through it
Simple to do it, pass the can around
Try to help one another

The pimp got tricks
That he learned from the other
Go by the color you'll discover
Damn everybody ain't no brother

Just when you thought it was safe
I'm dubbing mad breaks on ol' C.I.A. tapes
Ain't no stoppin' who in this country tis of you
It?s monkey see monkey do

Now in the age of followin' the celebrity rage
A twelve gauge flipped the whole page
The score lopsided in a one sided war
Could be more than what you bargained for

Six-pack weasels pumped up by their own press releases
Till the capital ceases
Ain't no difference tween black and white
Except the green in between, yeah, right

Know, what I mean? Spook that sat by the sound
Black like James Brown, it?s been goin' down
Spirit in your dark ass direction
Projection controls perception

Got you guessin' in the art of deception
Indexes confusin' Rolexes for Rolodexes
Another brother fried in Texas
Spent my best pay days hittin' off exec's
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Analysis of the situations
Bringing forth alarming revelations
Cigars a hundred thousand dollar cars, what
Most of us do the laundry in the bus

Is we blessed 'cause fast foods processed
Will the last be first can the first be less?
Got no leverage
Mad thirst for the beverages

Now the funk got us dead 'n' drunk
Got your drink on but got no think on
Now you got beef, wanna knock out teeth
Against the land of the lost, gettin' tosses

6 daze a week of course to the bosses
Old timers preachin' as born again rhymers
In the school gotta walk men
Graduates can't talk, man

Lyin' between the chalk man
shakin' that money maker
That MTV honey is a faker
Let Ill and Al take her

Deaded borders separated by the waters
Stats and surveys be off like Saturdays
Madd killers reproducin' like caterpillars
What's on your mind on the welfare line?

Cuttin' Medicaid got us droppin' like flies
Words from the wise comin' from the dead
Not alive from Facundo Ariel L'pez Trejo

Live And Undrugged Part I
Its been a long time
Since the rhyme rode
A rough road
I'm riding rhymes & givin
A dose of brotherland
Never said I wasn't good at it
Cause I'm a static addict
No fear you gotta
Know I had it
If you know better
Spose to do better
So I know like Al Green
We gotta stay together
Knock, knock...who's there
Where? overhere
Da boom kids knockin
Bang and they outta here
The dopemans livin at home
Aloneman
They dont understand
But they can
They can can
If I dont say it
I'm a sucka parlayin it
Don't really matter
When the flow fatter

But I dont dont
Believe
& duck bob an weave
Will deceive a street corner
And the 40 thieves

They bring em in
You do em in
He bring em in
You do us in

Smell em knockin da/boom
Hear em hittin nat/boom

I'm comin atcha
Live and uncut
An undrugged
These days they be thinkin I'm bugged
Livin I be kicken it

Hard instead of lickin it
Down domination on the overground

Tell me what we be
Seekin is self preservation
A nation of millions
Gotta go wit a feelin
Uncle Sam be gatt Uncle Tom
And when it comes to drugs
Uncle Tom gotta bomb
Can I get a pop
Till the muthafukas stop
Sellin nat shit
That make the hoody drop
No more easy gettin over
For da cracka in the back

Yo its over
Number 1 wit a bullet
He pull it what I do now
Cant out run it or duck
Or get a new Chuck
Up against the wall
Wont confess yall
I mo move & I'm gone
An so I guess yall
Lemme tell you so lend me a listen
I'm missin a life
If I aint givin up an ass kissin
No television or movie style
No buckwild thinkin
Cause I dont know what he drinkin
But he better act quick
Cause I'm gettin quicker
3 mo seconds to go
I hope he hold da trigga
If he do dat
The gatt iz outta his hands

& then he gotta deal wit a man
Punks jump up to get beat
I'm on the funky beat
Beat beat yall
Until its 6 feet
Under dirt & the mud
Here we go again
Another enemy if you
Never was a friend
Never clever
As I was in this endeavor
Never again trust a smile or grin
From comin outta da womb
To endin up in a tomb
Another sport
Caught knockin nat boom

Here go the verse that hurts
Head brother in charge
So I better get bodyguard
What can I do
Break a leg on the avenue
Where the bootleggers
They be stackin the odds
Try to be hard but they playin my cards
Fuckin wit chicken
But I'm duckin in the lard
Been goin straight since 78
I wanna live I dont wanna be late
I head em comin at me
Runnin fast & ruff
Aint this a bitch & test for the tuff
Bang/doubt it
Without a life
I cant live without it
Bang

Live And Undrugged Part II
Rhymer in a zone
Say u wanna revolution
40 acres to 40 ounces
Plus they announcin
The mule is the one thats fooled
But I pass to be that jackass
Knockin that boom
To the tomb
Out the womb
I bet against the spread
I flipped death threats
And the 3 to the head
Never get enough
The raw, the rugged, the ruff
Oh my the jam the dunk the stuff
I got a mind thats maddes than Minolta
Hard in a rock place my corner
And the winner is
Whoop there it is
33 years without a beer or slow gin fizz
Rather get frunk off
Hearin rhymin wit biz
Rhymamatician, rumpshaker
Mindquaker
Not a cracker or a quacker
But a waker
Put my thing down
Step my shit up
Put up or shut up
Peace to the original what up
Back to the motherland
Where its warmer, transformer
Kill the informer
I hear em talkin creepin
But I'm not sleepin
My mellow I go back
Way back going, going
Before crack
And the 8 track
Still goin, gone, goodbye
To the lazy
I ain't pushing up or drivin
No daisies
I gotta remember Philly in September
Aint nuttin finer than peace
In Carolina & to the gods
Wanna be, gotta be
Starter of mo flow
Here we go the front row
As I cut the silly rhymin
Riddlin still the flow
Gettin ridda dem
Racist swazis
Cause I'm brinin kamikazes
They gotta give us where we live
We don't own
What you think is home
Its time to go up in smoke
911 is no joke
Once again friends
This enemy states fiddy states
Still say chill wait until
The right time baby
Damn the blood line
Gettin raid with AIDS
But somebodys gettin paid
Lets get it on and a on
But brothers gettin killed
Cause blunts & 40's is like
Cookies to da milk
I'm not crazy
I'm the revelation
Last days in time
The overtime rhymer
Rhymer in a zone
Right vs wrong
Good versus evil
God versus the devil
Public Enemy
Muse Sick In Hour Mess Age

Shocklee - young - allen

Skills to kill
And fill a hole, we roll deep
Wit a frown that's down
Low in the meddle of jeep beats
So I'm makin a point
Not stickin butts or blunts
But the terminator x
And the rhythm he cuts
Figure this bigger brother
Gonna trigger the track
No I ain't country
And my name ain't zack
Step the fuck back
Take a look at the racks
My world is a ghetto full of tapes and wax
Cd's they only double the tax
And makin money money
New york city to lax
Tell the suckers suckers
Never ever relax
I'm kickin in cold facts so true
It feels like I'm livin in a zoo

Sayin I'm down like psycho
Where's my rifle? right though
I ain't michael, yo
I ain't sittin on the dock of the bay
Wastin time in a crime wit a nine
Rather find another brutal rhyme
It's us verses, I put it all in verses
If the sound reverses
I pump it up wit curses
Fuck sittin in the back of the bus
But don't front what we lack
We got it loaded in a back pack
See they can do it to a man
But wit men suckers semi
Think that shit before they come again
No science to the wild senile
Slackin cause he packin like a
Runaway child yeah
Would I ever try to sever, hell no
Never would work if the
Rhyme wasn't clever
Wild in an isle
Stackin high from the floor tile
Back in the rack, where the rap never seen a
What I gonna wanna do...
Feels like I'm livin in a zoo

I don't know where I'm at
Here's a track
I try to duck duck
Those 3 bullets in the back
Top 40
Ignore me
Sooooo
I him em in the hood
Until it feel good

But I'm all right though
I wanna fight crazy dirty

It's not a matter of skills
But a battle of wills
Pow the stick up go the quicker the picker up
Trigga eenie meanie

Wit the gatt that so fat
Brrap bap bap cop dilla in a 16 wheeler
They call me over the phone
Che-che-checkin me out
Takin my time
To find a brother droppin dime
Once again it's on
In the paint, and I ain't givin up
No props to the game
And it stops in the name of the hip hop
Reign and the pain got me goin
Goddamn won't they even pull a
Bullet on a pop jam

Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Engagin' on the stage, on a track
Tell Jack stay in the back
I was born
Every level I'm on
You're warned
Just in case you forgot
I pump in kilowatts
To let 'em know which direction
To go what's up I want to know
I test the front row
Forgiven the givin' while the livin' is livin' it up
So many people is sleepin' while standin' up
Not dressed to impress or fess it
That's it text to the brain like FedEx
Treated one and the same
'Cause the name of the game
Don't give 'em checks above necks
Some don't realize the same side
Siddity in the city
Suburbs or projects
But we're livin' in a different time
Some speed, some lead
While some jus' pump rhymes
Then again all in da same gang
Info to flow
And heal all below
Let's go and find
The piece of mind that's taken
Or else the black
or start breakin'
Public Enemy no!

This style seems wild
Wait before you treat me like a stepchild
Let me tell you why they got me on file
'Cause I give you what you lack
Come right and exact
Our status is the saddest
So I care where you at, black
And at home I got a call from Tony Rome
The FBI was tappin' my telephone
I never live alone
I never walk alone
My posses always ready, and they're waitin' in my zone
Although I live the life that of a resident
But I be knowin' the scheme that of the president
Tappin' my phone whose crews abused
I stand accused of doing harm
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
C'mon c'mon louder

I am the rock hard trooper
To the bone, the bone, the bone
Full grown, consider me, stone
Once again and
I say it for you to know
The troop is always ready, I yell 'geronimo'
Your CIA, you see I ain't kiddin'
Both King and X they got ridda' both
A story untold, true, but unknown
Professor Griff knows,
"I ain't no toast"
And not the braggin' or boastin' and plus
It ain't no secret why they're tappin' my phone, although
I can't keep it a secret
So I decided to kick it, yo
And yes it weighs a ton
I say it once again
I'm called the enemy, I'll never be a friend
Of those with closed minds, don't know I'm rapid
The way that I rap it
Is makin' 'em tap it, yeah
Never servin 'em well, 'cause I'm an un-Tom
It's no secret at all
Cause I'm louder than a bomb

Cold holdin' the load
The burden breakin' the mold
I ain't lyin' denyin', 'cause they're checkin' my code
Am I buggin' 'cause they're buggin' my phone, for information
No tellin' who's sellin' out, power buildin' the nation so,
Joinin' the set, the point blank target
Every brothers inside, so least not, you forget, no
Takin' the blame is not a waste, here taste
A bit of the song so you can never be wrong
Just a bit of advice, 'cause we be payin' the price
'Cause every brother mans life
Is like swingin' the dice, right?
Here it is, once again this is
The brother to brother
The Terminator, the cutter

Goin' on an' on, leave alone the grown
Get it straight in '88, an' I'll troop it to demonstrate
The posse always ready, 98 at 98
My posse come quick, because my posse got velocity
Tappin' my phone, they never leave me alone
I'm even lethal when I'm unarmed
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb

'Cause the D is for dangerous
You can come and get some of this
I teach and speak
So when its spoke, it's no joke
The voice of choice
The place shakes with bass
Called one for the treble
The rhythm is the rebel
Here's a funky rhyme that they're tappin' on
Just thinkin' I'm breakin' the beats I'm rappin' on
CIA FBI
All they tell us is lies
And when I say it they get alarmed
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb

Told ya buffalo soldier 
Fell to the ground like Folgers
Couldn't hold the boulder
Fancy dancer paralyzed for an answer
In the hip hop game but the rap got cancer
Tumors poppin' from the middle of rumors
Generation x be the end of baby boomers
Is the next generation headed for doom
Control the soul and you got a got a
Truck fulla fertilizer blowin up the spot
Think it's terrorism the border line's hot
Check the passports tap the telephone
Surprise they home grown
And one of your fuckin' own
It's dat same ol' shit, dat same ol' game
From that same ol' gang up to that same ol' thing
Now what I see say you know me
I pour a metaphor of lsd

I don't know what y'all thinkin' about
But if you know like I know 
You better strap on your seatbelt 
Cause you in for a long ride

Now I be damn I been a man
Figure I never call myself a nigger
To get Benjamins
What's love got to do with what you got
Not a whole lot no forgot oh this shit is hot
Spendin' all the cheddar for clothes
With a sign foreclosed on the front mud
Lost in dominoes

Now the heads tell tales 
How the dead bled and fled
Now they livin' up in the bed 
Instead they seize us like Jesus
Married to the mob did a sloppy job in hempstead 
Lord had mercy want to curse me 
New world order got my ass drownin' in the water
Now what you stuck to the west 
That funk to the east is phat
ATL be krunk dirty south
Thirty thou crankin trunks
Try to pass the test but to the rest they flunk
Now what be indebted
Better get over it
Those times and raps ain't never comin' back
No future without a pass I kick ass
Rock the socks offa pandora's box
Is itany wonder why the clocks flavor got 
Between rehearsin a verse my jaw lox
I set the bomb between the are and B scene
Go against the grain run up on the train
And so I parallel the brains of cobain
As hip hop brain made em spill the champagne
Make it plain the sound remains insane
Come the same no holes closin up the lane
Don't ask no questions on the simple level
Can the magic get shaq back
Knicks get van exel
Bold rap lyrics fuck whatcha heard
Not no lost and found nouns or half ass words
Turnaround funk power moves ruffs
I ain't never been cuckoo for no coco puffs
LSD, set it free make em see the tricks
Rather try at 37 than die at 26

Lawyers no loyalties accountants no royalties
Lie for a lie I look em in the eye
History speaking lawyers should die
Kissed the companies and made them all cry
A new rap song and a real drive by
Why o why did the video die
The narcs and the feds got the pimp niggas 'fraid
Threat of the aids got the bitches afraid
The god damn white man got you afraid
Social service got your mama afraid
Scared of the fact before a niggas black
Some of you say nigga before you say crack
You got no back is what you lack
Just say black and I'll see where your ass is at

I'm cold gettin' busy while I'm shakin' you down
I'm on the air, you're on the ground
Chuck D, the enemy, words you heed
Build for speed, but what you need is
Funky fresh lyrics fallin' down on time
Your enemy poppin' it, droppin' a dime
Comin' back rockin' a tomahawk jam
And still gettin' fly with the mike in my hand
I'm cold coolin' out, layin in the shade
Dealers buggin cause they're gonna get sprayed
Their intimidator, your Scarface
What's goin' on  what's takin' place
I don't wear gold but I clock ducats
And I have the money overflowing out of buckets
You want crazy dollars, I make people holler
You stick 'em stupid and I'm snatching biters collars
I'll rebuilt the mine to alleviate
Unnecessary pressures that can create
The sting that stung Yama-Goochie Foo Yung
When he bit the Public Enemy he only got hung
Cause his brain was gettin' bigger than a pregnant toad
His heartbeat stopped cause of overload
I made the beat that broke his back
I cut his circulation  made his world turn back
I find out things like E.S.P.
Amazing world of Kreskin's brain velocity
Like Alexander Munday, I'm in like Flint
Mercedes limousine with a hardcore tint
I'm captain of the ship, I make 'em walk the planks
Riding round the world, hundred sixty million francs
Not like the kind that you put on the grill
Cause I only do it like that when I'm on a chill hill
When I get to the beach, the ground's so sandy
Girls on my jock like ants on candy
Checking out the fellas with the girls on the side
Put ya boat in the water, let's take a ride
to the land of party people rocking shocking to the beat
So keep ya eyes on ya girl cause ya know I'm gonna cheat
I'm gonna max and relax and chill my will
Body rockin', brain shockin' makes your heart stand still
I'm goin' for the money that man ever made
Gettin' thrill from orders, suckers obeyed
It's gettin' late and I can't wait
To drive by the bus and rock my tape
My car is movin', fast like a train
Never skid off the road, even in the rain
Cold dodgin' tickets, rockin' all the jams
Make biters step back and understand

Man to man
I don't know if they can
From what I know
The parts don't fit

How he's sharin' a needle
With a drug addict
He don't believe he has it

But now he does, he doesn't know cause he
Goes straight to a ho
Tell you what who was next on the but
Wild thinin' on a germ
Runnin' wild
Yo stop
But the bag popped

Time is gettin' crazy, people clockin' out
They're robbin' all the cribs on a death wish route
Breakin' into cars trying to steal their system
20 pounds on the bar, betcha can't lift 'em
Ya throw two punches, now you got no wind
Hittin' mega pipes, gettin' super stupid thin
Crying all the tears, smokin' all the squares
Workin' for ya boy, ya came short and full of swears
Ya couldn't make the money cause ya smoked up the product
Walkin' round the town, skeptalepsy illaroduct
Can't be trusted cause you're living in the past
Ya should have kept yo ass away from that blast

MEGABLAST!

I got a homeboy who is out on the block
He sells mo crack that they sell fish at the dock
He runs to every car, thinkin' he's a star
He gets his product snatched by some people in a car
The car pulls off, he hung onto the side
Of the car that is in motion, guess his product took a ride
He tried to sell a dime for a thirty dollar bill
Fake gold plate on the back, no frill
Fake Hawaiian suit, scratched up knees
In his fridgerator, bread, water, cheese
Antique fork, how long will it last?
We'll see in twelve minutes when he wants the blast

Get that, ha ha, yeah boy
Bass for your face
Get that, ha ha, yeah boy
Bass for your face

Get that, bass, bass for your face
Bass for your face, bass for your face
Get that, ha ha, yeah boy
Bass for your face

Get that, ha ha, yeah boy
Bass for your face
Get that, ha ha, yeah boy
Bass for your face

Get that, ha ha, get that
Get that, ha ha, get that
Get that, ha ha, get that
Bass, bass, bass, bass for your face

Step back, get away, give the brother some room
You got to turn me up when the beat goes boom
Lyric to lyric, line to line
Then you'll understand my reputation for rhyme
Cause my rhyme reputation depends on what
Style of record my DJ cuts
His slice, dice, super mix so nice
So bad, you won't dispute the price
It's plain to see, it's a strain to be
Number one in the public eye enemy
I'm wanted in 50, almost 51
States where the posse got me on the run
It's a big wonder why I haven't gone under
Dodgin' all types of microphone thunder
A fugitive missin' all types of hell
All this because I talk so well
When I,

Rock, get up, get down
Miuzi weighs a ton

The match up title, the expression of thrill
For elite to compete and attempt to get ill
If looks could kill, I'd chill until
The public catches on to my material
Ducks criticize my every phase of rapture
Can't wait to read the headlines of my capture
Accused of assault, a 1st degree crime
Cause I beat competitors with my rhymes
Tongue whipped, pushed, shoved and tripped
Coocked from the hold of my Kung Fu grip
And if you want my title, it would be suicidal
From my end, it would be homicidal
When I do work, you get destroyed
Make all the paranoid, try to avoid
The Public Enemy seat I've enjoyed
This is no kid and I'm no toy boy

Rock, get up, get down
Miuzi weighs a ton

I'm a Public Enemy but I don't rob banks
I don't shoot bullets and I don't shoot blanks
My style is supreme, number one is my rank
And I got more power than the New York Yanks
If miuzy wasn't heavy I'd probably fire it
I'd make you walk the plank if I was a pirate
If they made me a King, I would be a tyrant
If you want to get me, go ahead and try it
Snatcher, dispatcher, biter never been a
Instead of takin' me out, take a girl to dinner
The level of comp has never been thinner
It's a runaway race where I'm the winner
It's unreal, they call the law
And claimed I had started a war
It was war they wanted and war they got
But they wilted in the heat when miuzi got hot

Rock, get up, get down
Miuzi weighs a ton

My style versatile said without rhymes
Which is why they're after me on my back
Lookin' over my shoulder, seein' what I write
Hearin' what I say, they wonderin' why
Why they can't ever compete on my level
Superstar status is my domain
Understand my rhythm, my pattern of lecture
And then you'll know why I'm on the run
This change of events results in a switch
Lateral movements of my vocal pitch
It eliminates pressure on the haunted
But the posse is around so I got to front it
Plus employ tactics so coy
And leave no choise but to destroy
Soloists, groups and what they say
And all that try to cross my way

Moby pemoby pemoby pemoby pe

Yo yo yo gee, guess what happened
To the burned up hand that was clappin'
Too good to be true
Getting all the guys turn to get in doo-doo
Took it all for granted
Then life start turn to granted
Having everything to having nothing
Now this turkey ain't got no stuffing
On the couch ill puffing
To get you buffin', it's you they got cuffin'
Your family they did not believe me
Till they heard it for themselves on TV
I called the crib, the clock said seven
More news at eleven

More news at eleven

I was watching the TV screen
Can't believe what I seen
Three guys tried to rob a store
Got more than what they bargained for
They shot them right before my eyes
All three just dropped like flies
If they only thought before they did it
Neither one of those three would have been with it
As they fell to the floor and got rougher
Now the family has got to suffer
Pallbearers got to carry them
While the family cry loud just to bury them
Newscast and people were heavily amazed
Flavor Flav just stared in a daze
Eyewitness News, channel seven
More news at eleven

This is Harry Allen hip hop activist and media
assassin with my co-anchor Flavor Flav for P.E.
TV and by the way if you still think that they're that
don't believe the hype

Signed, sealed, delivered I B yours
I pour it on the breaks
Till it break laws
Givin' the gabbin'
So the brothers be havin' it
Or else the five fingers of dope'll
Be grabbin' it
Wit' no complaints
Givin' uppin' I ain't
On the mike
Like Karl Malone in the paint
Why rip a rapper
When he flow like water
I rather rush a television reporter
The frauds that tried to front
Watch ya back
Stop pullin' those lil' stunts
Assault and battery
'Cause I snatched the battery
Off his back the TV pack
Why pop the rhyme
On a rhymer when I kick it
Rather spend my time, spittin' on a bigot
Who pumped the pimp
That fed the fiends
He got jumped by the brothers in Ft. Green
They slapped the mack
That kept us back
Sucker suckin' the hood like drack
So if ya draggin' us down
Wit' the wack attitude
Get up, lookout, get out the way
Move

Signed
Sealed
Definition of a set-up
Pourin' it on and won't let up
'Cause f-a-l-l-i-n
Never applied
To this brother that tried
To let ya know
The folk of the American joke
That kept us broke
Now I'm ready to rap
Strong fax I swing
Like Bo Jax
I'm never calm on a bomb track
60 percent 3/fifths
Constituted
Huh prostituted
Why I'm mad
'Cause it's written on the paper
Right now
motherfucker bow
Kicked
The
Lyric
About
The tricks
Of the trade and the money made
Who got the money betcha bottom
Dollar bill
Gonna find
Some rich ol' bloodline
But the blood is in the mud
Take the whack an attack it
Like a Skud
To the patriotic hater
That got paid off my people
I'm rude
Lookout, get out the way
Move

Signed
An what I'm gettin' is mine
I bring the noise
To town
So let's get down
I cranked the beats
Tearin' up the street
And the park
An it ain't Mozart
Jack movin' out
'Cause the black movin' in
And its old
I said it in
Who Stole The Soul?
 but ninety two bring
An attitude
That say I don't give a
Fuck
About the old way
This is a new day
Tell Jack stay in the back
And all the other
Suckers
That don't matter
You got
Somethin' to prove
Scatter
Get out the way
Move!

Here it is
Bam!
And you say, Goddamn
This is the dope jam
But lets define the term called dope
And you think it mean funky now, no
Here is a true tale
Of the ones that deal
Are the ones that fail
Yeah
You can move if you want to move
What it prove
It's here like the groove
The problem is this, we gotta' fix it
Check out the justice, and how they run it
Sellin', smellin'
Sniffin', riffin'
And brothers try to get swift an'
Sell to their own, rob a home
While some shrivel to bone
Like comatose walkin' around
Please don't confuse this with the sound
I'm talking about BASS

I put this together to
Rock the bells of those that
Boost the dose
Of lack a lack
And those that sell to Black
Shame on a brother when he dealin'
The same block where my 98 be wheelin'
And everybody know
Another kilo
From a corner from a brother to keep another,
Below
Stop illin' and killin'
Stop grillin'
Yo, black, yo 
4, 5 o'clock in the mornin'
Wait a minute y'all
The fiends are fiendin'
Day to day they say no other way
This stuff
Is really bad
I'm talkin' 'bout bass!

Yo, listen
I see it on their faces

Standin' in line
Checkin' the time
Homeboys playin' the curb
The same ones that used to do herb
Now they're gone
Passin' it on
Poison attack, the Black word bond
Daddy-O
Once said to me
He knew a brother who stayed all day in his jeep
And at night he went to sleep
And in the mornin' all he had was
The sneakers on his feet
The culprit used to jam and rock the mike, yo
He stripped the jeep to fill his pipe
And wander around to find a place
Where they rocked to a different kind of bass

Land of the free
But the skin I'm in identifies me
So the people around me
Energize me
Callin' all aboard this train ride
Talkin' 'bout raw hardcore
Leavin' frauds on the outside
But the bad thing is anyone can ride the train
And the reason
For that is 'cause we look the same
Lookin' all around at my so called friend
Light skin to the brown
The black
Here we go again
Homey over there knows Keith an
But he be thiefin'
I don't trust him
Rather bust 'em
Up out goes his hand and I cough
He once stole from me
Yeah I want to cut it off
The black thing is a ride I call the nighttrain
It rides the good and the bad
We call the monkey trained
Trained to attack the black it's true
'Cause some of them look just like you
Stayin' on the scene
Sittin' on the train
See all the faces
Look about the same
There go the sellout who's takin' a ride like Cargo
'Cause he deal
The keys from Key Largo
Runnin' Nat narcotic
By George he got it
Takin' makin' the G erotic
And the fiends they scheme
So he can put 'em down
But his method is wreck 'em
Put 'em in tha ground
Got tha nerve as hell
To yell brother man
He ain't black man
Known to murder his own
Traitor on the phone
Ridin' the train
Self-hater trained
To sell pain
The master's toy
Little boy
Hard to avoid he look wit' it but he null 'n' void
'Cause he ridin' the train you think he down for the cause
'Cause his face looks just like yours
More of the same insane who sayin'
Like flowin' like night train
Runnin' the pain of the black reign
You look, you laugh
You doubt and go out
And I'm gone
But the bass goes on
To talk the talk, but walk the walk
The king of New York
Crack a lack attack the black
To crack the back
Once again I test a friend wit' sincerity
Or consider him an enemy
Who am I to tell a lie
Rather push da bush
Hope da cracker get crushed
I'm rollin' wit' rush
Leader of the bum rush
Russian I ain't
Spreadin' like paint
Lookin' at the put I got
And its kickin'
But it ain't chicken
But it's livin' for a city
So sick 'n' tired
Of a scene buckwild, piled in a file
Senile or Chile
They said it never been no worser
Than this, I'm on the night train
They hope ya don't miss it
Give ya what dey gotta give you just go
You mustn't just put your
Trust in every brother yo
Some don't give a damn
'Cause they the other man
Worse than a bomb
Posin' as Uncle Toms
Disgracin' the race
Blowin' up
The whole crew
Wit' some of them lookin'
Just like you

1, 2, 1, 2, Yo
Yo 1, 2
Nothin' is Quick in the Desert
1, 2
Yo

Not put here to judge between the quick and the dead
I'll be slick with this nigga chime rhyme that I said
Digitize the present, download in a minute
The future is now, cause the ain't no front minute
They staying chained to the wagon of old ways
That last past second, we now call the old days
Yesterday's slaves, just hanging to get hung
Oblivious those slangin' poison with the tongue 
Unaware that being everywhere just ain't no lie
Desert MCs those who deserve to die
Or get poor trying, bitch stop lying
Everybody sellin', but ain't nobody buyin'
Adrenaline rushin', like my blood be gold
Like in 1849, Rob sold his soul
Like all good people can be cowards in the end
And the death comes quick in the desert my friend
Nothin' is quicker than death

[Outro: Flavor Flav}
Nothin' is Quick in the Desert

Power, equality
And we're out to get it
I know some of you ain't wid it
This party started right in 66
With a pro-black radical mix
Then at the hour of twelve
Some force cut the power
And emerged from hell
It was your so called government
That made this occur
Like the grafted devils they were

J. edgar hoover, and he coulda proved to you
He had king and x set up
Also the party with newton, cleaver and seale
He ended, so get up
Time to get em back

Get back on the track

Word from the honorable elijah muhammed
Know who you are to be black

Party for your right to fight fight
Party for your right to fight fight

To those that disagree it causes static
For the original black asiatic man
Cream of the earth
And was here first
And some devils prevent this from being known
But you check out the books they own
Even masons they know it
But refuse to show it, yo
But it's proven and fact
And it takes a nation of millions to hold us back

Check this out
This is Chuck D of Public Enemy

And this is Flavor Flav, boy

Yeah
And if you want to fight the power
You have to be the power
Strengthen the mind
And bury the weapons that you need to win
Stay in school and stay away from drugs

That's right
If you don't wanna be a goner
Stay away from the drugs on the corner

Public Enemy salutes the youth of today
You are the power of tomorrow, boy

Check this out
This is Chuck D

And this is Flavor Flav
And Public Enemy is lettin' y'all know about black history month

February is Black History Month
But we'd like to say that every single month
We should recognise the rich culture
And heritage of black people
Although the battles have not been won yet
We should be proud to take some time out this month
To explore the powerful and victorious lineage of our people

That's right so don't be a vulture
And learn your culture

PE salutes the history of black people
And the history that we are yet to make

That's right, not a mistake

On the outs I lace up, the world I face up
To score on anybody, its war on everybody
The new guys come in blood shot between the eyes
As long as their sellin' that merchandise
And one what goes in don't come back
The color may be green but its also black
And red I know many heads that spent bloodshed
Cursed in converses, dead in Pro Keds
Now every Tom, Dick, Harry or Joe Smith
Skip the spauldings, pony's, and k-swiss
High school and college coaches gettin'
Kickbacks from scholarships and them slave ships

Hey Dr. J where you got those moves
Was it gettin' high in the schools
Can it be the shoes?
Truth is truth, I tear the fuckin' roof off the house
Expose them foes with my mouth
I see corporate hands up in foreign lands
With the man behind the man gettin' paid behind the man
I hold the rocket stop the hand in my pocket
Two hundred a pair but I'm addicted to the gear
They'll make me do things on the court to amaze ya
I heard they make em for a buck 8 in Asia
They came a long way baby since
Clyde Frazier had pumas, pullin' mad consumers
Them Filas I'm feelin' but I can't touch the ceiling
Them New Balance hits a hundred and twenty million
The last thing I need is Adidas terminatin' my contract
For wearing those old pair of wack
Reebok low tops covered up by floppy socks
Gave me a jump shot before I got jumped and shot
Duckin' a word from my sponsor
Trying to end my year like Kwaanza

Been paid since the 8th grade
Eleventh grader, pop the champagne
Twelfth grade start the campaign
Gettin' fame sign my name in the dotted frame
Nike got me pullin' re's and G's
Shit, I can get shot for these
Please god give me twenty more years on these knees
To maintain without this game I gotta do keys
And I don't want to go there because its fuckin' everywhere
Factories want to be me kids want to see me
Behind the wheels and endorsement deals
Its the politics and the tricks behind the kicks

She wants a lover right now
But not no brother
Her man gotta have a lotta money
To get under her cover
Now she's a fine sister
But up here she's missin' it
She says she want to learn about life
No old black bull shit
At the age of 15 a brother gave her a baby
She's 19 now and it drover her crazy
And now every time
She turns around
All the people in the neighborhood
Look and get mad and sing

Meet Mr. successful
I guess he's blessed yeah
But he happens to be a brother
Who only wants blue eyes and blond hair
Now this young mister
He don't like sisters
He couldn't find that special one
He know why he missed her
He says sisters wasn't good enuff
They only wanted his green stuff
That's why everytime he turned
Around all the people
In the neighborhood
Looked and got mad
And sang

I try to tell my people
There should not be any hatred
For a brother or a sister
Whose opposite race they've mated
No man is God
And God put us all here 
But this system has no wisdom
The devil split us in pairs
And taught us White is good, Black is bad
And Black and White is still too bad
That's why every time I turn around
All the people in my neighborhood
Look mad and sing

And you thought the beat slowed down
Power to the people
Get on up, get into it, get involved
Feel the bass as the cut revolves
To the brothers wit the eight oh eight
Like I said before PE got a brand new funk
Turn it up, boom the trunk, yeah
Internationally known on the microphone
Makin' sure the brothers will never leave you alone
To my sisters
Sisters yes we missed ya
Let's get it together make a nation
You can bet on it, don't sleep on it
'Cause the troops cold jeepin' it pumpin'

Turn us loose we shall overcome
They say where you get that bass from
Hey oh people, people as we continue on
Come along, sings this song, are you ready for '91
Rhythm nation pump that bass an
We like to know from Chicago, New York and LA
Are y'all ready, cause the plans in the jam
And we're ready to roll yo y'all got to tell me
Are y'all read read to go c'mon

Had to kick it like that as we roll as one
One under the sun, to all the cities and the side
Stateside and the whole wide
There it is
P-e-a-c-e 1991

With vice I hold the mike device
With force I keep it away of course
And I'm keepin' you from sleepin'
And on stage I rage
And I'm rollin'
To the poor I pour in on in metaphors
Not bluffin', it's nothin'
That we ain't did before
We played you stayed
The points made
You consider it done
By the prophets of rage

I roll with the punches so I survive
Try to rock 'cause it keeps the crowd alive
I'm not ballin', I'm just callin'
But I'm past the days of yes y'allin'
Wa wiggle round and round
I pump, you jump up
Hear my words my verbs
And get juiced up
I been around a while
You can descibe my sound
Clear the way
For the prophets of rage

I rang ya bell
Can you tell I got feelin'
Just peace at least
Cause I want it
Want it so bad
That I'm starvin'
I'm like Garvey
So you can see be
It's like that, I'm like Nat
Leave me the hell alone
If you don't think I'm a brother
Then check the chromosomes
Then check the stage
I declare it a new age
Get down for the prophets of rage
Keep you from gettin' like this

You back the track
You find we're the quotable
You emulate
Brothers, sisters that's beautiful
Follow a path
Of positivity you go
Some sing it or rap it
Or harmonize it through Go-Go
Little you know but very
Seldom I do party jams
About a plan

I'm considered the man
I'm the recordable
But God made it affordable
I say it, you play it
Back in your car or even portable
Stereo
Describes my scenario
Left or right, Black or White
They tell lies in the books
That you're readin'
It's knowledge of yourself
That you're needin'
Like Vescey or Prosser
We have a reason why
To debate the hate
That's why we're born to die
Mandela, cell dweller, Thatcher
You can tell her clear the way for the prophets of rage

It's raw and keepin' you on the floor
Its soul and keepin' you in control
It's pt. 2 'cause I'm
Pumpin' what you're used to
Until the whole juice crew
Gets me in my goose down
I do the rebel yell
And I'm the duracell
Call it plain insane
Brothers causein' me pain
When a brothers a victim
And the sellers a dweller in a cage
Yo, run the accapella

Yo Chuck, bust a move man
I was on my way up here to the studio, you know what I'm saying
And this brother stopped me and asked me
"Yo, what's up with that brother Chuckie D, he swear he nice?"
I said, "Yo, the brother don't swear he nice, he knows he's nice", you know what I'm saying
So Chuck, we got a feeling you turning into a Public Enemy, man
Now remember that line you was kicking to me on the way out to L.A. Laurelton Queens
While we was in the car on our way to the shop
Well yo, right now, kick the bass for them brothers and let 'em know
What goes on

What goes on?
Well I'm all in, put it up on the board
Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared
1-2-3 down for the count
The result of my lyrics, oh yes, no doubt
Cold rock rap - 49er supreme
Is what I choose and I use, I never lose to a team
Cause I can go solo, like a Tyson bolo
Make the fly girls wanna have my photo
Run in their room, hang it on the wall
In remembrance that I rocked them all
Suckers, ducks, ho-hum emcees
You can't rock the kid, so go cut the cheese
Take this application of rhymes like these
My rap's red hot, 110 degrees
So don't start bassing, I'll start placing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
You and your mind from my beating from my rhymes
A time for a crime that I can't find
I'll show you my gun, my Uzi weighs a ton
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

One, one, one, one
One, one, one, one!

You got no rap but you want to battle
It's like having a boat but you've got no paddle
Cause I never pause, I say it because
I don't break in stores but I break all laws
Written while sitting, all bidding not hidden
Giving me the juice that you're not getting
I'm not a law obeyer, so you can tell your mayor
I'mma non-stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the rhyme player, the ozone layer
A battle what? Here's a bible so start your prayer
This word to the wise is justified
If they ask you what happened, just admit you lied
You just got caught up, for going out of order
And now you're serving football teams their water
You messed with the Master, word to Chuck
And I waxed cold taxed, make sure you got dunked
You just got dissed, all but dismissed
Sucker duck emcees you get me pissed
It's no fun being on the run
Because they got me Public Enemy number one

Don't you know, don't you know..
I got a posse of a force to back me up
Watch out, we got metal to match
Ambush attack on my back, double-team you get creamed
So we have it, so you won't catch
Wanna hear it again we got a force, enemy down
The L.I. circuit sound
And Chuckie D, myself and K-Jee, Flavor, DJ Melo-D
Oh yes, I presume it's the tunes that make us groom
To make all the ladies swoon
But it's also the words from our direction, out the homeboy section
Kicking like Bruce Lee "Chinese Connection"
On stereo, never ever mono
On wax, yes, I'm talking about vinyl
They said "Stop! Freeze!" I got froze up
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

For all you
Suckers, liars, your cheap amplifiers
Your crossed up wires are always starting fires
You grown up criers, now here's a pair of pliers
Get a job like your mother, heard she fixes old dryers
You have no desires, your father fixes tires
You try to sell your equipment but you get no buyers
It's you they never hire, you're never on flyers
Cause you and your crew is only known as good triers
Known as the poetic, political, lyrical son
I'm Public Enemy number one

Yeah, that's right Chuck, man
That's what you gotta do
You gotta tell 'em just like that, you know what I'm saying
Cause yo man, let me tell you a little something man
These brothers running around, hard headed
They get a little jealous, you know what I'm saying
Just like that, you know, they're trying to bring you down with them
But yo Chuck, you got to let them know who's who in the world to be
You got to let them know, that this is the 80's
And we can get all the ladies
And in the backyard we got a fly Mercedes
And that's the way the story goes
That's just the way the story goes
Let me tell you a little something man

Cant understand some of these 
Rhymin' in circles
Now patriotic emcees
On bent knees 
By six degrees
Lord have mercy
Even the voice of god rehearses
Attack of the 50 ft verses
Supermama this time around gotta few curses
Papa gotta new bag of cant get
Worse comes to worse 
Cant get enough
Of tryin' it
Sayin' nothing goin' no place no time soon
But buyin' it
Like gettin' in a car without drivin' it
Still black rock the wax like stax
I rip , I mix
Full screen like imax
So I max 
Relax
Off the deep end
Get deep in the record
100 beats per second
Cut down the like rhymes
Cause they get redundant
Refuse to stoop to stupid
Cause they dumbed it
Down
Like motown
Say it loud
Damn
Like I'm the new James Brown uh

Put it up
Put it up

Rocked the concoction
A potion of too much emotion
Uh,I'm a keep it in motion
Call it whatcha wanna
Bus stop, 'lectric slide cha cha
Funky 16 corners

Hot like Jill Scotts blues 
But damn too old for 22s
But I can still move
Groove
Lets roll
You cant do your thing 
If your things the wrong thing
Tax the payers
Stack paper
But you failed as an eighth grader
Dumb ass
Failed every math class
Plus I know this like otis
I like to know 
Are you ready for some super dynamite soul
F,it that's how it gos?
Beyond the cornrows
If I cant talk , get to steppin'
Tongue can be a tool and weapon
Listen

Put it up 
Put it up 

Tycoons
Damn I'm tired of these coons
Rhymin' in circles
Words can either help or hurt you
Or be neutral
Cats still might shoot you
What suits you 
If you gots issues
A thousand tattoos
Confused in 200 dollar gym shoes
Spendin' more than you got
Two thousand and two blues
Give it up turn it loose
Ain't no use
Rest of you
Screamin' rescue me from the residue
Fast break fives on two
Us against you
So what you gonna do?

Put it up
Put it up

Everybody over here, get on up
Everybody right there, get into it
Everybody over there, get involved
Everybody just, get involved

Microphone check, microphone check
Can I get a check up from the neck up?
Can I kick a rhyme while I'm checkin' my time?
Can I get a cure 'cause you did da crime?

For sure, you're probably killin' me
With these shots, tell me what I got
An' I'm gone, pandemic, who did it?
Right, who did it, that's who did it

Who, world health organized
Murderized, came to the aid, got paid
Doctor, doctor in a lab concocted a germ warfare
To the booty, I rocked it

A hundred and five million goin' down in da ground
Most in da black an' da brown
How did I catch this riddle?
If I didn't crossover like a Hardaway dribble

They blamed it on some green African monkey
Now ain't that funky?
While da clock is doin' da tickin' an' tock
I didn't know dat da guns aimed an' cocked

On us, on us, on us, on us
On us, on us, on us

We're runnin' outta
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time

Testin' one, two, testin' one, two
Can I get a blood check? Testin' one, two
Can I get a witness? 
Yes, you can
Can I get a witness? 
Yes, you can

Then check it

I'm checkin' records an' facts about da battle
To da Indian, Japanese, the whites an' the blacks
Germs, they spread it, warfare, I read it
Quote me on this, yes, again an' I said it

A bigger damage than the trigger an' glocks
A mass murder in mass from a blanket full o' smallpox
No guarantees, gettin' lesser fees
Tuskegee had us go out with disease

Please check da time, c'mon, check da rhyme
Tribe o' mine, killed by da swine
Who crossed da line? Who did da crime?
The mind of a world, destroyin' kind

We're runnin' outta
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time

A lil' piece of my mind while we runnin' outta time
People of color goin' out like no other kind
Mad drama, genetic gettin' wreck
Protect ya' neck, check the epidemic

Drug use, addiction an' murder, I heard a pregnancy
Infant mortality, rest in poverty not peace
Disease 'til deceased, sterilized, realized
That beast, so here's a word to the wise

They got us runnin' outta
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time

Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time

Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time

Boy, you need to check that alarm clock
And wake up, my brother

 Raise your hands, so we can
Raise the roof, so you can
Raise your voice, so we can
Raise the roof

Raise the roof because it's all on fire
Not done by the sun or electrical wire
Not done by sons stricking matches with daughters
But done by scratches so save that water
This jam is packed so I just figure
All we need is the house to get bigger
So startin' with the roof down to the base
We're at your service to burn the place

With the spot as hot as it can get
The roof's on fire, you're soaked and wet
The puzzle on your face shows as you sweat
But your body keeps movin' with no regrets
Chandeliers shake, swing from front to back
Left to right all night, and the lights don't crack
Your minds on the time, hopin' it don't end
It's time to get stupid, here we go again

Stare at the strope, pull your earlobe
For the sights and sounds clear across the globe
This jam might hit or miss the charts
But the style gets wild as state of the art
Dazzling in science, bold in nerve
But givin' my house what it deserves
Served on the floor cause I got payed
Make the fans that left, wished they had'a stayed
Realize my friend, ain't this a trip
As your body gets railed when you do the flip
And your mind gets rocked when we're on a roll
Then the freak of the week makes you loose control
A Swatch for a watch, so you'll know the time
Your crowd gets loud and you clock my rhyme
The messiah's on fire and I'm living proof
I'll quench your desire and raise your roof

In school I'm cool throughout the week
When the weekend comes, I'm down with the Greeks
Frat brothers known across the seven seas
Fly ladies of the 80's, sororities
Zetas, Deltas, AKA's
Women that keep me in a daze
Phi Sigma boys in the move
With the Kappas and the Ques and of course the grooves to
And for real it's the deal and the actual fact
Takes a nation of millions to hold me back
Rejected and accepted as a communist
Claimin' fame to my name as a terrorist
Makin' money in corners that you'll never see
Dodgin'judges and the lawyers and the third degree
Nothin' wrong with a song to make the strong survive
Realize gave me five cause I kept 'em alive
Mislead what you read bout my devilish deeds
Mislead what I said so you're better off dead
Make 'em hear it and see it for the Def and blind
And command it and we'll plan it for incapable minds
Take for granted and demand it from the wave of my hand
Make the jealous understand it, just say damn
When they see me ask a question, "How can it be?"
When they watch me pull a serpent straight out of the sea
Turn the winter into summer, then from hot to cold
Expand my power on the hour, make you all behold
From the slammer swing a hammer like the mighty Thor
God of thunder, you'll go under, then you'll all applaud
And fathom that distance, the mad must reap
Meet Namor sea lord, Prince of the deep
Here for you to fear at any cost
Tellin you to get busy or you better get lost
Livin' lives civilized from the lessons I tauhgt
Cities buried underground just because I went off
My friends, enemies, better be my friend
Is queston people guessin' is this the end?

End of the world, are you guessin' yes?
Just say don't delay it, get it off your chest
Houses of crack, I've seen too much
I go ready, aim, fire, then I'll blow 'em up

Yes, the rhythm, the rebel
Without a pause, I'm lowering my level
The hard rhymer, where you never been I'm in
You want stylin', you know it's time again
D the enemy, tellin' you to hear it
They praised the music, this time they play the lyrics
Some say no to the album, the show
Bum rush the sound I made a year ago
I guess you know, you guess I'm just a radical
Not a sabbatical, yes to make it critical
The only part your body should be parting to
Panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

Radio, suckers never play me
On the mix, just O.K. me
Now known and grown when they're clocking my zone it's known
Snakin' and takin' everything that a brother owns
Hard, my calling card
Recorded and orderd, supporter of Chesimard
Loud and proud kickin' live next poet supreme
Loop a troop, bazooka, the scheme
Flavor, a rebel in his own mind
Supporter of my rhyme
Designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim I do crime

Terminator X

From a rebel it's final on black vinyl
Soul, rock and roll comin' like a rhino
Tables turn, suckers burn to learn
They can't dis-able the power of my label
Def Jam, tells you who I am
The enemy's public, they really give a damn
Strong Island, where I got 'em wild and
That's the reason they're claimin' that I'm violent
Never silent, no dope gettin' dumb nope
Claimin' where we get our rhythm from
Number one, we hit ya and we give ya some
No gun, and still never on the run
You want to be an S.1, Griff will tell you when
And then you'll come, you'll know what time it is
Impeach the president, pullin' out the ray-gun
Zap the next one, I could be you're Sho-gun
Suckers, don't last a minute
Soft and smooth, I ain't with it
Hardcore, rawbone like a razor
I'm like a lazer, I just won't graze ya
Old enough to raise ya, so this will faze ya
Get it right boy and maybe I will praise ya
Playin' the role I got soul too
Voice my opinion with volume
Smooth, no what I am
Rough, 'cause I'm the man

No matter what the name, we're all the same
Pieces in one big chess game
Yeah, the voice of power
Is in the house, go take a shower boy
P.E. a group, a crew, not singular
We were black Wranglers
We're rap stranglers
You can't angle us, I know you're listenin'
I caught you pissin' in you're pants
You're scared of us dissin' us
The crowd is missin' us
We're on a mission boy

Terminator X

Attitude, when I'm on fire
Juice on the loose, electric wire
Simple and plain, give me the lane
I'll throw it down your throat like Barkley
See the car keys, you'll never get these
They belong to the 98 posse
You want some more son, you want to get some
Rush the door on a store, pick up the album
You know the rhythm, the rhyme plus the beat is designed
So I can enter your mind, Boys
Bring the noise, my time
Step aside for the flex, Terminator X

When I get down
I give what go around
And when I cough
I do my best to cut it off
I don't claim to be a preacher
Not paid to be a teacher
But I'm grown
I try to be a leader to the bone
Never could follow a man
Wit' a bottle
He's a baby wit' a beard
Not a feared role model
And they ask me where I got it
I get it from my pops
Wit' a man in the house
All the bullshit stops
Then I sing a song
About what the hell is goin' wrong
You never know
If you only trust the TV and the radio
These days
You can't see who's in cahoots
'Cause now the KKK
Wears three-piece suits
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
In fact you know it's like that y'all

I never tried to pretend to have an
Accent that I never had
So why don't you stay away awhile
Come hear the freestyle
The quicker the sticks
With the guitar licks
Complete the beat for your feet
Check out the drum kick
I'm here to live for the love of my people
Kickin' it all about rebuildin' so all the children
Avoid the self destruction
So long I'm gonna do y'all a favor
Cause I got the flavor yea
Get low not high you can't deny
Homeboys and girls you'll testify
The p-e-f-you-n and the K will stay
And make your body sway cause we got
The funky beat on the street on your feet
Can you feel the heat in your mind all the time
You don't have to find the effect of the
Rhythm an the funky rhyme on your body
On your gear so have no fear in your hair
Everywhere if you dare take this never
Miss that funky list of super rockin' cuts
That you can't resist on the move make ya
Groove prove that we choose our cuts
Make you strut and shake your but
Bend your back get the knack of the
Funk attack
Yes, yes y'all take that

 Chuck D
Rest in beats from Heavy D to Eazy-E
The Notorious B.I.G., we have lost so many
Still wonder in my Adidas why Jam Master Jay had to die
And Lisa Left Eye
Off top no rehearsal R.I.P. salute
Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal, my man...
Still in shock at the loss of Afeni and Pac
His spirit lives on, it won't ever stop
Scott La Rock, heard a dope story about him from the Blastmaster
Out west RIP Mac Dre and The Jacka
When we die it plants new seeds
For new Big bad Hanks
And new MC Breed's, remember?
And the Sean P's that spit that raw
J Dilla got all the beatmakers still in awe
I'm not a pimp but Pimp C forever UGK
Rest In Beats is the way that we say
Salute!

Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As the legacy continue, on and on and on 
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue on and on and on 
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue, on and on and on
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue, on and on and on
Salute in tribute, light a candle, play a song
As their legacies continue on

We lost brick and mortar record stores
And really dope diverse tours
R.I.B. Rest in Beats
Original flavor and more
We lost the art of everyone being in the same studio
Rest in Beats

The love for the art dipped in the dough
We lost real flows to mumbles and memes
We've seen the loss of ideas that we were kings and queens
Where are the groups? Too many going solo
We lost streets, teams, promo, YouTube and Vevo
Man, I miss the time when you really had to rhyme
When lines weren't reduced to ghetto, studio and crime
For all that we lost, still the essence is preserved
Through beats, sound stages, dope energy and words

"Everybody listen to this!"

Rest In Beats!

{Verse 3]
Never cared how doves cry til I heard you die
Now I wanna forget and God knows I've tried
I wished you heaven, i hope that you heard me
People undisputed there was no controversy
Tired of the change that their life seems to bring
Never feared for silence, the dead still sing
And we can celebrate by dancing in the streets
Your music, your legacy, Rest In Beats!
I'm sick of the scenario man I'm buggin' out
So let's go, let's get loud, let's shout
Nothing but love, yes the good die young
Forever find your way, your songs will be sung
September now, always got me thinking of you
Rememebring the hard times you helped me through
It wasn't your move, but the way you moved me
Your music, your legacy, Rest In Beats!

Damn back again up on track again
? 'round the bend
Some of y'all black again it got dark
On your mark get set out of sight out of mind

Hypocrites forget like marionettes strings in the back like nets
The chosen one who fuckin' laugh themselves to death
Lack of rhymes meaningless punch lines
Battle for your mind like Israel and Palestine

Good news in some fuckin' hard ass times
No more disses repeated hook lines and chorus'
Days full of doris' got issues and wishes
Got the jam but gettin' paid up off the misses

Ain't nothin' wrong but wait fuck another love song
It's the brand strangler bringing noise in the wranglers
Rock all the heads big times and Alzheimer's
Shot the pill while I drop skills up in Brazil

Now the pitch time for a label switch
They psych it I put the roof up on top of this bitch
Guess what like tony ?
They forgot I used to ? around that clock

Lord save us from that sword of Davis that kidnap
Hip hop tracks and the beats in the game of rap
Put my soul in it careless about the gold in it
Boom the shotty got 'em running from the paparazzi

Lodi dodi when the feds come and doom your party
Cracker in the back don't you know it's Illuminati
Ain't nothing changed pe we be the same crew
Resurrection in the game here to save you

Yo it's going down baby it's going down family
That's my word we gettin' ready to turn this shit
To the two and three zeros you know what I'm sayin'
Have all the clocks goin' backwards

Have everything goin' haywire
You laughed before let's see you laugh now blue cow
Hell now black cow word to birds
Word to bird word to bird nigga

One on one hard like tarot cards
Behold the one man million man march
Takes a nation 400 year violation
Apocalyptic no power in this happy hour

Hazardous no you don't like Lazarus
Just black baby where my soul be at
Star spelled backwards is rats let bra man rap
I'm trapped in the back with these industry cats

One step forward two steps back
Making habits claiming habitats ratta tat tat
Wish you could turn back the hands of time
And get mental pop the tape eight track Lincoln continental

I'm the mouth that roared swore to the lord
The eye of hawk both live and die by the sword
The forbidden the six man be sinnin' from the beginnin'
You know the suckers hand be hidden

Intense knocking your block with some sense
Pe got more jewels than dead presidents
The devil try to get me cross like a crucifix
But I'm focused on the vultures like a local locust

New world order is goin' down gettin' 'round
I'm as spooked as that by the sound
Fuck it with Saddam I'll bring a new saigon
Ain't nothing changed pe we be the same crew boy

Yeah that's right nine eight no jokin'
We coming out smokin'
And for all y'all that's been sleeping on us
You're lacking you're lacking
Ayyo check 1-2 I've got my man
That's about to sneak up on you and your crew

Ya know what I'm saying ayyo check 1-2
Ayyo masta killa I want you to put one up in 'em son
And show 'em you ain't done son
Ball 'em with the back of the gun son make 'em run son

Sliding down Broadway beneath the j line
Slumped in the incline position mind travels
Beyond the shell which holds the soul
Controlled by the Allah I'll be the most humble

But also punishable
For those who are unlawful to righteousness
I strive to stay alive and live this
Many fell victim to the wisdom

I mastered sex the track ovulates
The mic like prostate gland impregnates
Onto the paper the pain pours
Or the love of my brother that hurts just the same

Fuck fame my gun I bust to maintain
Moods are insidious baffles and eludes
Those who label the god as anti-social
Chose not to apply their third eye
I travel at the speed of thought rate it's fatal
What will enable a man to levitate

And you can take that and put that
On the back of your brain son
Coming straight to you from masta killa
Ain't nothin' iller

I told you pe is still in full effect
Beyond the year two thousand
We ain't taking no shorts and y'all need to know that
To make your head fat boy

Revelation, revelation 

Yeah that's right, y'all better act like you know
Shit is gettin' critical 
Shit is gettin' crazy, that's right 
Y'all better listen yo shit is blazin' G
Shit is blazin', that's right, I'm tryin' to let y'all know 

Soldiers of the future
We are approachin' with to be Earth's last battle
The war fever's on the rise
The lives of many are in the hands of fate
Armageddon is the destiny we await
In the trenches of the ghettos we meditate
Developin' our defense, I'm gettin' tense
I hear the bombs of time tickin'
As the smoke of fear thickens in the air
I cock my glock and give thanks
For the peace that will exist, when this war is over
Revolutions, revelations will be revealed
Babylon has fallen, now time to build, labwars

When I spit at the government bombs like Saddam hit
Make you flip to the music with your shit half-lit
Harder than time and convicts
Rhymes never be basic, afraid of the dark
Twenty-five to the L, no I just can't face it
Need a mill for two passports and face-lifts
Ain't tryin' to see handcuffs and steel bracelets
Twisted politics, high speed chases
On the races, locked down places
Prophet of rages, reincarnation as gauges
Set to show off in the blazes
Revolution, revelation, resurrection stages
Raw like wild dogs locked up in the cages
And my brain cell with ice picks under the floor
Plottin' the war I'll sign a Shakur for sure
Revisited, hear the shorties be quizzin' it
Geronimo Platt, politically incarcerated cats
I dwell on all the black males doi

We was raised in these streets on pork and poison meat
Now I recognize the beast and bare the mark of the gold teeth 
Puff on the rolled leaf and bust on the police
While y'all playas are fakin bacon we cook the whole beef.
I put it down plain, I stimulate the left and right brain
Cell by cell and frame by frame.
Names, dates, are all inmaterial. 
I big dick sick ryhme killer like cereal. 
I burn like venerial, 
And spit that imperial wizardry that climbs right through 
The curcitry.
Choake your team for their cream 
But that's as far as we go
Drop shit like seaguls and smash your little ego.
I get visions like stevie and coleco,
Give me two thousand live people
One late show no sequel.
Ain't no equal in the flesh
I been through more evil than men do.
Nasty off the head and with the pen too!

Now I'm pissed
Easy to rhyme on tracks like this
The more things change
The more they remain the same
These games them vidiots 
Playin' on the brink of insane
Must be a hockey rink
Lost in their drink
In pursuit of plain Jane
I think man they think a revolution be pretty in pink
Now in these new tracks 
Some of these cats don't know how to act
All them criminal acts ain't got nothin' to do with rap
One hand cuffuffed behind them backs in black
Quiet riot ,y'all cant hear one hand clap
Revolution is more than what you hear and what you see
The mass reintroduction 
Of society to society
Together we got 100 years of sobriety
These clones 
Who be flippin' like new phones be surprisin' me
Turned out
They happy just to be in the house
So I'm a call emout
I ain't no church mouse
Luvout

I master rap
Write a 16 and half of that
Then eat some mix greens after that 
My raps niggerish black like licorice 
While wack rappers get rich off some jibberish
The hoods begging for deliverance"g" 
I'm just a hood figure to deliverance this
L y should get into the "sy"
I'm thinking me and pe should have passed it on
Society's the menace
He get's more love than tennis
On the road to riches
Cause revolutions expensive
Finance whips. 
Finance clips spend our chips
In the ghetto raising rebelz with some fine ass tits.
No champagne no campaign no ice on my wrist
While bred'z dipp'n on fedz sipp'n on crys
Out of my mind Ethiopian wine on my lips
Still ain't signed the master mind
The masters mine. hey!

Back in your dome where the rebelz Rome
The greatest weapon in the hands 
Of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed

Public enemy the seventh octave we out

I get down to what it is
And if it ain't funky 
People askin' me what's goin' on
With my mind
 wait a minute

It's just a matter of race
Cause a black male's in their face
Step back for the new jack swing
On the platter scatter huh
We got our own thing
Just jam to let the rhythm run
Day to day, America eats it's young
And defeats our women
There is a gap so wide we all can swim in
Drown in  an get it
Got it goin' on wit it
Sister  soul sister
We goin' be all right
It takes a man to take a stand
Understand it takes a
Woman to make a stronger man

They'll call me a crazy Asiatic
While I'm singin' a song
Oh my god, oh my lord

I can't hold back
But I get exact on a track
It's an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Forget about me
Just set my sister free
R-e-s-p-e-c-t my sisters, not my enemy

And make the suckers say
 this generation

They don't know what we got goin' is 
To turn it all around
To my sisters I communicate
With the bass and tone
through speakers and the microphone
Cause I'm tired of America dissin' my sisters

And they try to say she's a liar
My people don't believe it
But even now they're getting higher
Of the feeling inspiration
We must know that in this nation
Every single generation

strange as you say, I say revolution
Need for change brings on revolution
The great book just look see solution

God chooses who and what for the bruisin'
There's been no justice for none
Of my sisters
Just us been the ones that's been missin' her
Now we got to protect
We get together and damn this generation

I said so to what it is
Where it is
She needs a lil' respect
There it is
I say she needs a lotta
Brother from a mother like me has gotta
Give it up
Give it now
And pass it all around
To my soul 

They disrespected mama and treated her like dirt
America took her, reshaped her, raped her
Nope, it never made the paper
Beat us, mated us
Made us attack our woman in black
So I said sophisticated B, don't be one
Not to head the warning crack of dawn
Or is it the dawn of crack?
Stop the talk they say, but
We talk and say what's right or wrong
Some say we wasting time singin' a song
But why is it that we're many different shades
Black woman's privacy invaded years and years
You cannot count my mama's tears
It's not the past but the future's
What she fears
Strong we be strong
The next generation
It's what not who we are facin'
The fingers pointed to us in our direction
The blind state of mind needs correction
Word to the mother we tighten connection
To be a man you need no election
This generation generates a new attitude
Sister to you we should not be rude
So we come together
And make 'em all say
Damn this generation

Hear the beat go
It's a bird, a plane, and the sound remains the same

Brothas gotta rap
Brothas gotta rap 
Brothas gotta rap 

Here I am, Superman again
Cause you know damn well I'll never be the man again
Here I go, on upload, stand up and watch the game unfold
3 minutes to download
Revolverlution, make your brains explode
When understanding, knowledge, wisdom
Love, elevation and and activism
Let's call it raptivism
Since a lot of MCs be stuck on isms
As in sexism, self hate racism
Why many cats end up stuck in prison
Youth slavery is what you see and
Is what you be mentality
Beyond reality a fantasy
But that fantasy is kilin me
I don't give a damn if you bounce to this
I don't give a damn if you shake to this
But I give a damn that you overstand
Revolverlution, the Rap Superman

Brothas gotta rap
Brothas gotta rap
Brothas gotta rap

Revolverlution, The final frontier
And I'm outta here
Have no fear some of these rhymes wear a cape
But the record don't fit on a stack of Bushshit
Sick and tired of bein sick and tired
If what you want is what you need
If you can see yourself beyond the weed
Pappa bringin on a new breed of MCs
You know what? Wooo wheee!
Face it, tell me why ex-fans be hatin
The present state of the hip hop nation
Maybe it's your president of the corporation
Is why we in this situation
Some is dumb, double up the drums
Hear the beat go..
Watch em all come
Damn! Revolverlution
You know who? The Rap Superman

Brothas gotta rap
Brothas gotta rap
Brothas gotta rap
Hear the beat go!
Let the brothas rap!
Let the brothas rap!
Let the brothas rap!

Double up the drums

The Rap Superman, cut off the program
Raised the whole fam
Now that sounds hot, I stopped the robots
Children of the gone who the grown forgot
Lost and then found ex lovers of hip hop
Who watched another artform gone to rot
Beyond the bushes I save a lot
Under the underground sound of hip hop
And even if this joint gets hot
You'll still never ever know what I got
Revolverlution all up in this spot
Now the rubber hits the road
Broke the motherload
Download! And hear the beat go...

Hear the beat go!
Hear the beat go!

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this
Right

You spend a buck in the 80's, whatcha you get is a preacher
Forgivin' this torture of the system that brought cha
I'm on a mission and you got that right
Addin' fuel to the fire, punch to the fight

Many have forgotten what we came here for
Never knew or had a clue so you're on the floor
Just growin', not knowin' about your past
Now you're lookin' pretty stupid while you're shakin' your ass

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this
Right

Some people fear me when I talk this way
Some come near me, some run away
Some people take heed to every word I say
Some wanna build a posse, some stay away

Some people think that we plan to fail
Wonder why we go under or we go to jail
Some ask us why we act the way we act
Without lookin' how long they kept us back

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this
Right

Yes, you if I bore you, I won't ignore you
I'm sayin' things that they say I'm not supposed to
Give you pride that you may not find
If you're blind about your past then I'll point behind

Kings, queens, warriors, lovers
People, proud sisters and brothers
Their biggest fear, suckers get tears
When we can top their best idea

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this
Right

Mind revolution, our solution
Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Corners don't sell it, no, you can't buy it
Defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this
Right

Our solution, mind revolution
Can't sell it, no, you can't buy it in a potion
You lie about the life that you wanted to try
Tellin' me about a head you decided to fly

Another brother with the same woes that you face
But you shot with the same hands, you fall from grace
Every brother should be every brother's keeper
But you shot with your left while your right was on your beeper

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this
Right

As the world turns, it's a terrible waste
To see the stupid look stuck on your face
Time bomb alarm for the world, just try it
Known to all zones as the one man riot

I'm on a mission to set you straight
Children it's not too late
Explain to the world when it's plain to see
To be what the world doesn't want us to be

Mind over matter, mouth in motion
Can't defy, 'cause I'll never be quiet
Let's start this

Yeah that's right Chuck man, that's what you gotta do
You got to tell 'em JUST LIKE THAT, you know what I'm sayin'?
Cause yo, man let me tell you a little somethin' man
All these brothers around here fiendin' for that crack-a-lack-a-lack
You dig what I'm sayin'? Yo man, all they wanna do is get what you got
But when you ain't got nothin', then they wanna cut you off
So what you gotta do, you gotta play 'em long distance
You know what I'm sayin'? I mean long distance
They think we takin' shorts, show 'em this is Cold Medina man
C'mon, kick it!

Back one more time, here to put the message in a rough rhyme
It's important that you knowin' the time
Cause I'm seein' the program, know what I know and
Until we get together we will never be up for sure
So I wreck like I'm posessed by Malcolm X
See the feds want us dead, we too complex
I always speak the truth, comin' from me to you
We movin' as a unit so you know we refuse to lose
I got my eyes on the lies from Washington
I'm a survivor, I know how the West was won
See a show and tell, the way the CoIntel
Undermine the real hip-hop so the cops can trail
But know bad boys move in silence
Save us all from the pain of a life of violence
They tappin my phone, full grown and knowin'
And still prone to refute the lies, won't stop until we rise

Rise up! "C'mon, ah-c'mon"
Rise rise up! "One more time"
We rise rise up! "C'mon, ah-c'mon"
Rise rise up! "To the beat y'all"

I'm a hard truth soldier to the bone for change
Demonstrate and separate the fact from strange
Blame companies killin' our children
When the villain's on the record 
Never think for a second that's the way we live
Wanna squeeze on the fleas at MTV
We quiz knots for the cops at BET
Seize the time, always rhymin' combinin' the antidote
For dope Interscope and fake gangster quotes
Cause I can recollect times when records set
Collect a dead brother you mind if you silence it yet
Rest the program, defeat the beastie
Cause on the street they do as we influenced by what we see
And yes it "Weighs a Ton" I say it once again
That's why the Enemy is down with Paris and KAM
It's all fam, we collide we live
Better decide on which side you ride, won't stop until we rise

Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 
Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 
Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 
Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 

I know the power of fame, ain't never playin' no games
Never croonin' is provin', that we ready for change
Never simpin' but they pimpin' my people, for the dollars
So I holla back it keep us from evil 'til them devils are collared
And like I said it's on, I say it once again
Better know the plan to keep us ignorant
Brother to brother, ain't no other can smother
Or erase my case, we marry words with bass
Just another wicked rhyme that I'm rappin' on
S1's got my back if the clappin' come
Pass on the work, makin' sure the words are known
Keep 'em nervous, make 'em understand we servin' foes
Keep it goin' strong, nevertheless, know the enemy
And never back down, you can take it to press
'Less the mic like the art dart told you before
We for the prize emphasis the fight, now c'mon and rise

Yo this is the Wreck League
We 'bout to wreck things in the nine-five
AIYYO~! We gotta set this off!
We gotta set this off, Wreck League, bring it

Wreck League, check, protect ya neck
Stop the presses, I stress the second guesses
Punks jump up, we ain't stressin
Just aggressive by fear to beat and choke the white folk
Let's get ready to rumble!
In the jungle nobody loves a loser cause he lives alone
I'm on a level to find a way to flip {shit}
Words of collision, hit up and roll like a rock
Rhymes is wreckless and the flow is on top
Nobody rocks it quick no more, the beat is still brick
By brick hardcore not cheaper to keep it
Hit me and I hit you back Jack, League gimme some of dat

RUMBLE~!
Let's get ready to RUMBLE~! 

I throw the jab, package crazy rappers
Son slaughter thick type beats, {?} cabbage
Attack like a heart failure, mad wicked
Lyrics turn your whole style vivid and spliff lifted
Roulette rapper, brain twistin with the clapper
Near-sight paramedic vocals won't appear right
Prepared to strike, raps is dynamite soaked in gasoline
I dream potent, substance floatin
In my soul blood vessel, words that smoke wrestle
Out the mouthpiece son, let it happen
He travel like a captain his lieutenant action or chief rappin
Slaughter cord jaw-damagin {be fraggilin?}
You better keep packin, the new faction
Melquan lifts the Terrordome, vocal assassin

Boom, wham, bang, WE'RE BACK~!
It ain't a Batman flick it's B-Wyze
Ridin on the track, like a
Cowboy, rollin on your crew
Sayin "Whassup now boy?" A new sheriff
 meet me in the jungle
When you're ready for the rumble
I never mumbled just crashed crushed and crumbled
I'm callin out you, "Come Around My Way"
WARRIORS~! COME OUT AND PLAY-AY~!
Fools who don't wanna do jack but get high
BRRRRAP, BRRRAP, BRRRRAP, BRRRAP, DIE~!!~!

BAM! BAM! Come with the Black Star thriller
Bavarian thought thriller, natural born killer
Who's the next victim to witness the wrath
Of the shogun, flame-smokin MC's in my path
Drop the math, eighty-five percent is dosed
Can't accept the truth, leavin their brain comatose
Who's to blame? Representin the {motherfuckin} name
Wreck League ball,  rhymin is the game

DY-NO-MITE is the , about to get
Zoo, then check Zoo, slice your whole crew
That's it, for Fo Man Choo
I be body rhymin this thing original
Body boom basher, I'm the lyrical master
Who's the rugged body boom banger inspiring minds
To fight and boom bang a physical king and I rock
The body boom banger bash and bump to death
Slice with my device to rip up the set

The Wreck League
We 'bout to wreck things in the nine-five
AIYYO~! We gotta set this off!
We gotta set this off, Wreck League, bring it

Bomb drop designed as
A warning shot
Listen
Cause some of us don't check statistics
Kick it
40 or so so million blacks in America
How can 13.5% of the population be scaring ya
88% of us cites are black
95% of America's suburbs are white
But 10% of blacks are 50% white
But post racial politics
Tricks and lessens the fight
Education economics enforcement of law
The gaps the ratio even
Worse than before Obama baby
The truth is America
Will show you the door,
Survey says
Run till it's dark, run
Run till it's dark, run
Run till it's dark, run
Run till it's dark, run
Run till it's dark, run
Run till it's dark, run
Run till it's dark, run

Truth hurts,
Makes me curse in this fight the power church
Stole history from everybody
Sellin lies at the tea party
Shame,
Survey says peeps fed up with the feds
40 acres to 40 yards to 40 feet
Might as well be sleep
Down laid out 6 feet
Deep respect
Not yet
You gotta give it to get
Survey says
You gotta learn to earn way beyond your check
Lovable as huggin a bull
That's some bull
Negativity
Gotta lot a pull
What's the use?
If you tie the noose
And love the abuse?
Hanging yourself while you loving the loot
DJ Lord knock it
Outta the park
Survey says:
Run till it's dark, run
Run till it's dark, run
Run till it's dark, run
Run till it's dark, run

Flavor Flav]

In ninety-eight I'm livin on large estates boy!

Chorus: *sung*

Flavor Flav shake yo' booty

Stack paper, and let's get crazy
Throw your hands in the air then be Swayze

Terminator X!!
Ha hah, let me hear that one more time, one more time
Terminator X!!

One more time, one more time, Terminator X!

You're blind, baby
You're blind from the facts on who you are
'Cause you're watchin' that garbage

The woman makes the men all pause
And if you got a woman
She might make you forget yours
There's a 5 letter word
To describe her character
But her brains being washed by an actor
And every real man that tries to approach
Come the closer he comes
He gets dissed like a roach

I don't think I can handle
She goes channel to channel
Cold lookin' for that hero
She watch channel zero

She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch

Yo baby, you got to cut that garbage off
Yo! I want to watch the game
Hey yo, lemme tell you a little som'in: I'm
'a take all your soaps
An' then I'm gonna hang 'em on a rope
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause that garbage your watchin' don't make no sense
Hey yo, lemme tell you a little som'in baby
I'm 'a take your set an' I'm 'a throw it
Out the window
G's

Two, seven, five, four, eight
She watched she said
All added up to zero
And nothing in her head
She turns and turns
And she hopes the soaps
Are for real, she learns
That it ain't true, nope
But she won't survive
And rather die in a lie
Falls a fool, for some dude, on a tube

I don't think I can handle
She goes channel to channel
Cold lookin' for that hero
She watch channel zero

She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch

Yo baby, you think I'm jokin'?
Do it look like I'm jokin'?
I ain't jokin', word up, baby
Yo, cut that garbage off now
Yo, I got the Tyson fight on, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, so you can't be comin' in here stackin' {aid} like that
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, we gettin' ready to watch the Super Bowl
We got a black quarterback so step back

Trouble vision for a sister
'Cause I know she don't know, I quote
Her brains retrained
By a 24 inch remote
Revolution a solution
For all of our children
But her children
Don't mean as much as the show, I mean
Watch her worship the screen, and fiend
For a TV ad
And it just makes me mad

I don't think I can handle
She goes channel to channel
Cold lookin' for that hero
She watch channel zero

She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch
She watch, she watch

Yo baby, can't you that's nonsense you watchin'?
Look, don't nobody look like that
Nobody even live that, you know what I'm sayin'?
You watchin' garbage, not'in' but garbage
Straight up garbage
Yo, why don't you just back up from the TV
Read a book or som'in
Read about yourself
Learn your culture, you know what I'm sayin'?

I testified
My mama cried
Black people died
When the other man lied

See the TV listen to me double trouble
I overhaul and I'm comin'
From the lower level
I'm takin' tabs

Sho nuff stuff to grab
Like shirts it hurts
With a neck to wreck
Took a poll 'cause our soul

Took a toll
From the education
Of a TV station
But look around

Hear go the sound of the wreckin' ball
Boom and Pound
When I
Shut 'em down

One two three four five
Six seven eight nine
What I use in the battle for the mind
I hit it hard
Like it supposed

Pullin' no blows to the nose
Like uncle L said I'm rippin' up shows
Then what it is
Only 5 percent of the biz

I'm addin' woes
That's how da way it goes
Then you think I rank never drank, point blank
I own loans

Suckers got me runnin' from the bank
Civil liberty I can't see to pay a fee
I never saw a way to pay a sap
To read the law

Then become a victim of a lawyer
Don't know ya, never saw ya
Tape cued
Gettin' me sued

Playin' games wit' my head
What the judge said put me in the red
Got me thinkin' 'bout a trigger to the lead
No no

My education mind say
Suckers gonna pay
Anyway
There gonna be a day

'Cause the troop they roll in
To posse up
Whole from the ground
Ready to go

Throw another round
Sick of the ride
It's suicide
For the other side of town

When I find a way to shut 'em down
Who count the money
In da neighborhood
But we spendin' money

To no end lookin' for a friend
In a war to the core
Rippin' up the poor in da stores
Till they get a brother

Kickin' down doors
Then I figure I kick it bigger
Look 'em dead in the eye
And they wince

Defense is pressurized
They don't want it to be
Another racial attack
In disguise so give some money back

I like Nike but wait a minute
The neighborhood supports so put some
Money in it
Corporations owe

Dey gotta give up the dough
To da town
Or else
We gotta shut 'em down

Talkin dat drive by shit
Everybody talkin dat gangsta shit

Talkin dat drive by thang
Everybody talking dat gangsta swang

Slaves to the rhythm of the master
Buck boom buck another
Neighborhood disaster

A gun iz a gun iz
A muther fuckin gun
But an organized side
Keep a sellout niga on the run

What you gonna do to get paid
Step on the rest of the hood
Till the drug raid

See you runnin like roaches
Black gangstas need track coaches

The white law set you up raw
When you have his trust in killin us

Talkin dat gattalk
Walkin dat catwalk
Where you tryin to go wit dat
Dont even go dere wit dat rap
Guns drugs an money
All you know how
So whatcha gonna do now?
I'm bout ready to bounce
Trouble on the corner of blunt ave
An 40 ounce
Madd uncivilized lifestyles
30 years bids for kids, now thats wild
I'm raisin my child
I'm steppin to da curb
Wit a sign do not disturb
Too much dont give a fuck
Or a damn thing
But choose what the other man bring
I sing a song cause I see wrong
I'm not down with the fe fi fo
Where I come from
See, the brothers aint dumb
Sense goes over nonsense
When it makes no sense
I'm throwin up da fence
Talkin dat drive by shit
Everybody talkin dat gangsta shit
Talkin dat drive by thang
Everybody talkin dat gangsta swang

Talkin dat gattalk
Walkin dat catwalk
Were you tryin to go wit dat
Dont even go there wit dat rap
Guns drugs & money
All you know how
So whatcha gone do now?

Break

The only good niga iz a dead niga

Dats what they used to say

Cant understand why a man
Gotta use a trigga
On his own, suppose to act grown

Cracka in da back
Watch a brother pull a trigga on another brother

Couldn't shoot and shot a mother

Four kids alone home
Ungrown & now they on they own
Now check yourself cool
What good iz da hood if ya actin a fool
Talkin dat gattalk, walkin dat catwalk

Uh! Backwards!

c'mon! c'mon! c'mon! 

Oh no, struck by greased lightning
F'ed by the same last name, you know what?
China ain't never givin back that god damned plane
Must got this whole nation trained on some kennel ration
Refrain, the same train, full of cocaine, blows the brain
Have you forgotten? I've been through the first term of rotten
The father, the son and the holy Bush-shit we all in
Don't look at me, I ain't callin for no assassination
I'm just sayin, sayin
Who voted for that asshole of your nation?
Deja Bush, crushed by the headrush, when I wrote the bumrush
Saw you salute to the then Vice Pres
Who did what RayGun  said
And then became prez himself, went for delf
Knee deep in his damned self
Stuck in a three headed bucket, a trilateral Bush-shit
Sorry ain't no better way of puttin it
No you cannot freestyle this
Cause you still ain't free
If I fight for y'all then they get me
How many o y'all is comin to get me?
None! Cause it's easier to forget me
Ain't that a Bush, son of a Bush is here all up in yo zone
You ain't never heard so much soul to the bone
I told y'all when the first Bush was tappin my telephone
Spy vs. Spy, can't truss em, as you salute to the illuminati
why'know what? Take yo ass to your one millionth party!

He's the son of a Baaaaaad man
The son of a bad...
He's the son of a Baaaaaad man
Son of a bad..........

Now here's the pitch
Hiding inside certified genocide
Ain't that a Bush, repeat ain't that a Bush?
Out of nowhere headed to the hot house
Killed 135 at the last count
Texas Bounce! Texas Bounce! 
Cats in a cage got a ghost of a chance
Of comin back from your whack-ass killin machine
Son of a Bush, ain't that a son of a Bush
Cats doin bids for the same Bush-shit that you did 
Serial killer kid, uhh! Serial killer kid
Go on!

He's the son of a Baaaaaad man
The son of a bad...
He's the son of a Baaaaaad man
Son of a bad.........

the father, the son...
the father, the son...

the father, the son, and the holy Bush-shit
The father...
The father...

Coke is the real thing
Used to make you swing
Used to be yo thing
Daddy had you under his wing
Uhh, son of a Bush
Bringin kilos to fill up silos
You probably sniffed piles
Got inmates in Texas scrubbin tiles
That shit is wild
That shit is wild CIA child
That shit is wild CIA child......

He's the son of a Baaaaaad man
The son of a bad...
He's the son of a Baaaaaad man
Son of a bad......

Son of a bad, man

That woman in the corner, cold playin' the role
Just leave her ass in the corner till her feet get cold
Knowin' for a fact, that girl is whacked
If you hold your hand out, she'll turn her back
Better walk, don't talk, she's all pretend
Can't be her friend unless you spend
Wall to wall, after all
Get ready to throw only money at the bitch

Cause she thinks she's so-
phisticated

Peekin', seekin' inside a book
Her demands for a man with a chemical look
Wishes, desires, gettin worse with age
She doesn't want a man, all she wants is a page
Ain't got a man so she goes to a club
She think it's classy but it's really a pub
But that's the kind of place she likes to go
The bitch got a problem

Cause she thinks she's so-
phisticated

Jackets, shoes, everyday ties
The girl only wants one of those guys
Suckers who front like it ain't no thing
Pretend to be friends, don't want that thang
Talk like this, don't talk slang
Do anything to get that thang
Tries to be chic and play it off
Peekin' through the window, I saw her take her clothes off
Nasty girl, stone cold freak
Stayin' in bed a whole goddamn week
Comin' and leavin' guys servin' up storms
From execs with checks, boys from the dorms
Never kept a name, never seen a face
She could pass 'em in the street like it never took place
I know she's a ho I'm on the go
Expose the funky bitch

Cause she thinks she's so-
phisticated

Now she wants a sucker but with an attache
And if you ain't got it, she'll turn you away
You can smile with stile but you lost your trial
Cause you got a gold tooth, she thinks you're wild
She don't want a brother that's true and black
If you're light, you're alright, better stay back
Cause the sucker with the bag is out the catch
With something in his bag keepin' her attached
The man's got a plan, it's IBM
The devil at her level, yes it's him
His Audi she rides, his gold and clothes
The ill base method, turning up her nose
Lack a lack a lack, now beaming her up
She still got the nerve to turn her funky nose up
Her status looks at us from down below
Now the bitch is in trouble

Cause she was so-
phisticated

Little is known about her past
So listen to me cause I know her ass
Used to steal money out her boyfriends clothes
And never got caught, so the story goes
She kept doin' that to all her men
Found the wrong man when she did it again
And still to this day people wonder why
He didn't beat the bitch down till she almost died

So-
phisticated

Full fledgin never sat on my legend
No shuffle or shoulder shruggin
Uncle Tommin nickel & dime rhymin
This renegade rippin
Rugged trax I love it
Sorta black owned
Like da Denver Nuggets
Pow pow
The original
Harder hitter
Iz back in black
On deck wit a turtleneck
Uh ha you can drink
All you want
But hard dont make
Da liquid matter you intake
The logical
Sorta psychological
Brother like butter spread to one
Another
Thicker da blunt & got sicker
Once upon a rhyme all bigger
Meant was for bigga cotton picker
Leave alone
The men from the mice
Who twice packs da gatt
Turn into dirty ratts
I'm comin wit the andidote, I hope they cope
To da rhythm I wrote
Pawns in da game
Goin down da drain
Final call to my race in pain

Yea, ha ha
Oh, kick that shit G. 
Nothin'.
Yea.

Sold, black gold, one strong buck,
To the Milwaukee Bucks, for a million bucks.
Just get him off the streets so he don't get bucked.
Super agent to the rescue so he won't get fucked.
Uh, run nigga run to the auction block.
But you can't pledge allegiance to the block.
This buck here, is the right kinda stock.
For sale for passin', the right kinda rock.
Yo. Auctioneer Stern, to massive fuck.
Can a nigga go home to where he used to walk?
Come back, but super agent said, "You can't talk"
I didn't know basketball had a bauk.
Uh the Buck runs laps, while they run craniums.
Players be drainin' 'em, owners be claimin' 'em.
Super agents fraimin' 'em and then nicknamin' 'em.
Drainin' they ass, to pack them stadiums.

Super agent wouldn't even come in my hood.
If I had no skills, was wackin' no good.
Uh, in my neck of the woods the leagues concrete.
One can only dream about wood, yea.
Feel the grain and let the bills get paid.
Pay respect to the projects,
And the half court rejects.
Scholarships, save that college shit.
Then championships, don't pay for the head trips.
Can I get a chance if I don't sing or dance?
Right about romance? Or wear short pants?
So I rave and rant, and you can't say I can't,
Get my grants, cold chillin in a b-boy stance.

All witness, no cheers the four years I ain't with this.
Hell with the N-see-double A 'cause my super agent's paid.
With his dollars I could buy a fuckin' college.
Mister Ra-ra campus isn't keepin' school bustas.
Lookin' who's lovin' ya, going for the juggeler.
They know they can't contain me on the regular.
Pimps pushes, the pocket book guzzeler.
Would you pardon my father please, Mister governor?
Thought he had it made, dreamin' about a trade.
Things we get, help but the roof on this bitch.
Dark side of the room when he jumped the broom. 
Super agent got this player, nine figure wages.
Back of sports pages, off ghetto stages.
Shootin' sleepin' pills and runnin' to the hills.

Jump back poppin' that track 
Gonna wreck it now

Watchin y'all, to the record now
Catchin y'all attention 
So shake it now
Oh no find my flow
Gonna break it down
Came a long way
You cant take it now
Regulatin' on the regular
Do your thing. on the floor
Can you kick it now

Do your thing
Do the damn thing baby
C'mon bring it now 
Go back like 8 tracks and cadillacs
Way before crack even similac
Hell with the wire taps
New booby traps
Hear the hand claps uh
Where the party at?

Do the damn thing 
Getcha gravy on
Cause I be gettin' it down 
And your crazy on
Go on and on an on till the break of dawn
I give a damn
Cause damn is ya baby gone

Do whatcha wanna do
But try to do the right thing
If its the right thing
Then go on 
Do the damn thing 
I know you get soul
Like a bbq chicken wing
Treat me like a king
Lemme hear you sing

Money cant buy you love
Thought you knew that
Eight days a week
Livin' like a rugrat 
Sex machine cant face fact
Gotta chase the cat
Hear the hand claps
Turn the damn thing up
Here we go again
No means no
So now you know again
Flow it like a poet 
Get ready then
Dance gotcha tremblin' in dem timberland
Jumpback poppin' that track
Gonna shake it now
Check the cat
Gettin' wreck gonna break it down the record now
Gotta break it down
Rhymin' this flow on the go
C'mon get it now

Yeah 
I'm saying we went from gods to niggas
From queens to bitches
Who in the hell told you that you were in heaven
Who in the hell told you that you were in heaven
Platinum gold a house and a car
But poverty all around you by far
People living under bridges or in a car
Heaven for the super rich who call it modern living
But the man from the east calls it a wilderness
Cause heaven for whites is hell for blacks in america
Heaven and hell are two conditions of life
Not a place up there or a place down there
It's a condition of life on earth so value life
Heaven is not things
It's a higher level of thinking
And at the moment one may change the conditions of life
Our people think a job, partying and endless flow of women and moet,
Krystal and how much sex you can have is heaven
Sometimes you got to think that it may not be heaven all the time
But being able to meet life's struggles head on, head on, head on
Without compromising your soul soul soul soul
In this worlds life
Not life after death
Life on earth
Life
Not worrying about how you are gonna eat or put clothes on your children
Sit yourself in heaven at once
A woman is a very important part of heaven
She produces heaven with you
And if she is connected to the source of life
So heaven is a condition of life
And you can have it on earth
So value life
Value life
Who in the hell told y'all you were in heaven
Oh, oh
Lord have mercy!

Yeah back it up
Vultures of culture
A dollar a rhyme, but we barely get a dime
Uh-huh, check it out

If you don't own the master, then the master own you
Who you trust, from Swindler's Lust? 
From the back of the bus, neither one of us
Control the fate of our soul, in Swindler's Lust

Hickory dickory dock
Hand in my pocket, rob me for my chocolate 
Mo' dollars, mo' cents, for the Big Six
Another million led to bled, claimin' innocence
Is it any wonder why black folks goin'' under,
'cause niggas be sold in bundles
No pressure, tell me why they don't care
Rap and RandB pavin' the streets of Bel-Air
From the sales of singers, no longer here
The bigger killer, get the bigger share 
Now the ones I attack, Negroes got their back
No, eighty twenty is a wack contract
Forever lack, the voice of real blacks
Stole rock 'n' roll and ain't gave it back 
Started off my defense, now they're the ones I defend against
Who fell up into the tricks
"Fuck the Fight the Power shit, get that Chuck D nigga fixed,
And keep him up out of the mix"
Well hell, tell em Chuck don't suck no dick
Be an ass, and that ass get kicked
Hand in my pocket, rob me for my chocolate
Watch em swindle yo' ass and turn a profit

If you don't own the master, then the master own you
Who you trust, from Swindler's Lust?
From the back of the bus, neither one of us
Control the fate of our soul, in Swindler's Lust

They don't care about me, they don't care about you
They don't care about you and your crew
Your family neighborhood and plus, heh,
They don't give a damn about us

One thing about them, they like to exploit though
Vultures of culture
They like to exploit little suckers
A dollar a rhyme, while we barely get a dime

Profit off the soul of black folk
Turn em into bitches, niggas, and stupid ass jokes
Laugh with us? Or laughin' at us? That's what I'm guessin'
We in the Rutgers program with that question

They came in and sat at the feet 
Of our ancient ancestors, they learned 
They took it back, they came back, then they imitated 
Once they got enough, they came back and destroyed

Laughin' all the way to the bank, remember them own the banks
And them god damn tanks 
Now what company do I thank? Ain't this a bitch
Heard they owned slaves, in a ship that sank

Aight aight aight aight yo yo
Where all the Louie's? 
Where my Louie's? 
Ehehe

If you don't own the master, then the master own you
Who you trust, from Swindler's Lust?
From the back of the bus, neither one of us
Control the fate of our soul, in Swindler's Lust

This to the blues people in the Delta
This for everybody in the 50's that didn't, get their money
Little Richard gettin' half of a penny
All of the super soul singers of the sixties
All the bands of the 70's on the outside lookin' in
All the people that didn't make a dime
Off their session playin'
And even the rappers in the eighties and nineties
Still tryin' to get paid, from what they put in, yeah

If you don't own the master, then the master own you
Who you trust, from Swindler's Lust?
From the back of the bus, neither one of us
Control the fate of our soul, in Swindler's Lust

Hm

That woman in the corner cold playin' the role 
Just leave her ass in the corner till her feet get cold 
Knowin' for a fact that girl is whacked 
If you hold your hand out she'll turn her back 
Better walk don't talk she's all pretend 
Can't be her friend unless you spend 
Wall to wall after all 
Get ready to throw only money at the bitch 

Cause she thinks she's so 
Phisticated 

Peekin', seekin' inside a book 
Her demands for a man with a chemical look 
Wishes, desires, gettin' worse with age 
She doesn't want a man, all she wants is a page 
Ain't got a man so she goes to a club 
She think it's classy but it's really a pub 
But that's the kind of place she likes to go 
The bitch got a problem 

Cause she thinks she's so- 
Phisticated 

Jackets, shoes, everyday ties 
The girl only wants one of those guys 
Suckers who front like it ain't no thing 
Pretend to be friends, don't want that thang 
Talk like this, don't talk slang 
Do anything to get that thang 
Tries to be chic and play it off 
Peekin' through the window, I saw her take her clothes off 
Nasty girl, stone cold freak 
Stayin' in bed a whole goddamn week 
Comin' and leavin' guys servin' up storms 
From execs with checks, boys from the dorms 
Never kept a name, never seen a face 
She could pass 'em in the street like it never took place 
I know she's a ho I'm on the go 
Expose the funky bitch 

Cause she thinks she's so- 
Phisticated 

Now she wants a sucker but with an attache 
And if you ain't got it, she'll turn you away 
You can smile with stile but you lost your trial 
Cause you got a gold tooth, she thinks you're wild 
She don't want a brother that's true and black 
If you're light, you're alright, better stay back 
Cause the sucker with the bag is out the catch 
With something in his bag keepin' her attached 
The man's got a plan, it's IBM 
The devil at her level, yes it's him 
His Audi she rides, his gold and clothes 
The ill base method, turning up her nose 
Lack a lack a lack, now beaming her up 
She still got the nerve to turn her funky nose up 
Her status looks at us from down below 
Now the bitch is in trouble 

Cause she was so- 
Phisticated 

Little is known about her past 
So listen to me 'cause I know her ass 
Used to steal money out her boyfriends clothes 
And never got caught, so the story goes 
She kept doin' that to all her men 
Found the wrong man when she did it again 
And still to this day people wonder why 
He didn't beat the bitch down till she almost died 

So- 
Phisticated

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Take a look at his style
Take a check of the sound
Off the record people keep him down
Trick a chick in Miami
Terminator X packs the jams
Who gives a fuck about a Goddamn Grammy
Anyway and I say the D's defending the mic
Yeah, who gives a fuck about what they like
Right the power is bold, the rhymes politically cold
No judge can ever budge or ever handle his load
Yes the coming is near and he's about to become
The one and only missionary lord son of a gun
Going on and on back trackin' the whack
Explain the knack y'all for the actual fact, c'mon

Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Go, go, go, go, go, go

He goes on and on 'till he reaches the coast
Tired, wired of his own race playing him close
Understand his type of music kills the
Plan of the klan
You know the pack attack the man
With the palm of his hands
Police, wild beasts, dogs on a leash
No peace to reach, that's why he's packin' his black piece
Terminator X yellin' with his hands
Damn almighty rulin ready to jam
But his cuts drive against the belt
Sheet, he's bad by his damn self
Yeah, his one job cold threatens the crowd
The loud sound pound to make brothers proud

Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Go, go, go, go, go, go

Gettin' small makin' room for it all
Flavors on the phone so he can
Make the call
I know you're clockin' the enemy
You should be clockin' the time
Checkin' records I'm wreckin' you
For defecting my rhyme
No provokin', no jokin', you know the stage is set
If you're thinkin' I'm breakin'
He ain't rocked it yet
My education is takin' you for a long ride
I'll make you brain slip and do the slide
Glide into infinity, it's infinite
With your hands in your pockets
I know your money is spent
Like this, like that, butter for the fat
If you kill my dog, I'ma slay your cat
It's like that y'all, can you handle it son
I'm public enemy number one

Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off
Terminator X go off

Little piece of my heart like Janis
No Joplin
But pure hip hoppin
As they try to ban us
Crazy flight time no jacket
Or ticket
Wilson Picket had soul
Fat trax so the rappers
Can kick it
Alan freed the waves
As much as
Lincoln freed da slaves
Its here I bleed and some
Bled until dead
I got the rhythm from this
Headbanger
Who used to fly high
Now he's just hangin in da hanger
Hangin around homeless
In a city of no hope I can't cope
Just to think
See they used to call it dope

Ya took me from a place
Where the race didn't matter
And gathered up bodies
Without a choice
So I rather
Pass my opinion/back
Run ya over
With my rack an pinion
Never stop the engine
For watcha fathers did do the indian
North & south
Plus the Carribbean

I got a vendetta
Cause I know better
Better black than a stereotype white
No cash flow wit out work
Talkin bout the past
You busted our past
You busted our ass
Now you afraid cause I never got paid
Now sucka jump
You cant take whatcha want

Chorus
You can't take whatcha want
Cause ya took whatcha want
Cant get away cause we got it on tape
You cant take whatcha want
Cause ya took whatcha want
Thin line between law & rape 

You can't take whatcha want
Dont cha know
We aint got nuttin left
Cause you took the rest
We aint got jazz rock & roll
Rappin the lose
Wit a few fat ladies left singin da blues
Go abracadabra to make
A wish I can mess wit
Wonder why I'm under
Neath a crew I cant get wit
I never knew land was an acquisition
BS from the best man in position
Come again wit dat shit
And set hit like a punk
No, you cant take whatcha want

Chorus 2X

Break

You cant take whatcha want
I open up the trunk
I see your phony ass
Try to counterfeit funk
From land to land

To sea to sea
Allover got the other man
Messin wit me
Took the motherland
Made a slave of my mother and man
Got a good man
Sayin goddamn

...................Long pause

And to hell with
Back in the days
Unless we go way back
To the black ways
Always
Watch your back
If ya crooked dont front
You cant take whatcha want

Chorus 2X

We died on the line
We walk the fine line he talked a good line

Here a track I found underneath
Findin' beats is a treat
An' I don't care if it top pop
Abracadabra can't keep a tab a
This stickin' around like D an' it stuck Chuck
Into a mode, unloadin' pop, pop, pop
Go the weasels that dropped from the hip hop
Kissin' the good bye
Goin' goin' gone
Keep it flowin' on
Like a lemon I ain't livin'
Like a lime here's a line
To those here's a rose keep the casket closed
Gone and in check
The next is from the X
Wrecked and affected by the rest huh
How I'm gonna go I gotta flow
'Cause they figure I'm a gonna...
Tie goes to the runner

Politikin' I be wreckin'
I reckon he's the electrician
Pullin' the switches on brothers
Who be in disposition
I never got along wit' the long
Arm of the law
I saw where they place the hardcore
To them it doesn't matter
Where it splatter
Our blood from the bullet
Not ballot I vote for Jim Brown
I know it don't rhyme
Does it matter that he
In fact he won't find
Excuses inside of Murphy Brown
I'm on a level livin' low
Here we go I know
If this was Africa I'd try to give a necktie
To those runnin' & lyin' disguisin'
Three guys 
Tie goes to the runner

Not surprised at all
About the riot zone
And I moan
I wish they leave me alone yo
This was predicted not self-inflicted
By the rapp outta the 'hood
They picked it good
Hittin' heavy critical aim at all the phony names
Prez rembezzlers
Who gettin' voted mayor
Lookin' at 'em wit' an
Evil eye 
I don't buy the fly look
As the fall guy
I'm livin' low across the tracks
Politikin' who stickin' had better
Watch their backs
In another long hot summer
Tie goes to the runner

An' I quote
I freak da notes
I double the dose
All she wrote
Devour got the power of a double man
Get excited just don't bite it or you're in trouble man
Got a rhythm to ride
A thought provoke
'Cause I don't joke
Here's a brother wit' an attitude
Don't get me rude
Chew it up wass up it's like food

You go ooh and ahh when I jump in my car
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
When I'm up to par, no matter who you are
I betcha go hip hop, hurray or hurrah
But the ahhs and ohhs is my kind of news
Pop your tape in, put your car in cruise
I never heard the boos, I never drank booze
Cause I just rock the rhythm, left alone the blues
The L.I. mystique, You sneak to peek
A look and then you know that we're never weak
I know you can't wait, it's never too late
No fear I'm here, and everything is straight
Cycles, cycles, life runs in cycles
New is old, no I'm not no psycho
The monkey on the back makes the best excel
The people in the crowd makes the rock well
The people in the back lets you know who's whack
And those who lack, the odds are stacked
The one who makes the money is white not black
You might not believe it but it's like that
When you come to my show, watch me throw
Down with the other brothers toe to toe
When you make a move, new not used
And watch the bro here just bust a groove
A fat lady soprano, loads my ammo
And hear my jam, with a funky piano
Easy on the wall but hard on the panel
A fool smokes Kools cause he chokes on Camels
In effect, the crew's in check
Run by the posse with the gold around the neck
Homeboys in heat, lookin' for sweet
Ladies in the crowd so they can meet
Somebody to body, makin' a baby
Givin' it to grandma then makin' her crazy
I'm a MC protector, U.S. defector
South African government wrecker
Panther power, you can feel it in my arm
Lookout y'all cause I'm a timebomb
Tickin', tockin', all about rockin'
makin' much dollars while the crazy one's clockin'
The rhythm, to shake the house downy down
Bounce to the ounce, sound so crown
The man, the enemy, Public King, no
All fall to the force of my swing
Like Ali, Frazier, Thriller in Manila
A pinpoint point blank microphone killer am I
No need to lie, got the Flavor Flave

To prove ill win and if not the save
I'll pick up, rack up - put your whole shack up
Just choose to lose the bet, emcee stick up
This is the wiz, but the mike's not his, it's mine
One time let the star shine
And I'm tellin' you, yelling at you you're through
Don't think you're grown because your moustache grew
I'm number one, you know it weighs a ton
And I'll be the burger, you can be the bun, girl
Surroundin', my steady poundin'
Get, get on down to my funky sound
And rock the rhythm rhyme, one time your mind
Rhythm roll, two times control,
the mauler and the caller of your doom
And when I'm ready to leave, you're gonna know I go boom
Three times y'all, rhythm rhyme and rock
Then you'll that the D is on the block
Four times y'all and never ever the whack
It's the hour to the minute, time to blow BLACK

What do you got to say about this
A force so strong that you can't resist
You may as well join'em, you know  you can't beat'em
Pack a hundred people, ya know ya gonna need'em
Straight with the system is down by law
Cause every two hours they get nine more
They run all dollars that come in town
Either join the crew or get beat down
I watched all the guys be so damn cruel
Try to get fast, you must be a fool
Blood through and through, the boys don't play
I seen'em tax and run an operation today
They got too, too, too much posse

Yeah, I threw a party, much people came by
I'm talking to a 'g' cause the 'g' real fly
Sittin' in my room, chewin' off her ear
Chillin' stypid fly, I got fly gear
My door kicked open, her man and crew
The 'g' turned  turned to me and said, "Who you?"
So I said, "Yo fly. Yeah the 'g' lied."
Stuck in the corner while the 'g' cried
And then from the back, my homeboy came
He pulled out a gun and said, "Go blame."
Ya lying ass girl with the fake tears
We got posse and we show no fears
We got too, too, too much posse

Aye yo man, ya yo yo yo
I'm tryin' ta stay away from it but it won't stay away from me

You better ask yourself
What do you want, what do you need, what will you find
Don't be afraid, don't fall asleep, open your mind
I hope this rhyme gets you in time and space, come to a different place
Where you hear spiritual lyrical knowledge and you're face to face
Like welfare, and these rappers lyrics they need help there
Does KRS represent heaven? Hell yea
Let me take you elsewhere, where you stand, there's a curse there
For sure, unless you're mature, grow up
If you're immature, then you're livin' sinister
You reject the words of the minister
You better get witcha Qu'Ran or bible, you won't be livin' long
If you're livin' idol, the t'cha, that's my title
Shakin it up, wakin' it up, makin it up, breakin' it up
Takin it up higher, no liar, you can't deny the
Public Enemy, with the public enema
I gets way up in your buttocks, I rocks cause it's hip-hop
The long-laster, Chuck D with BlastMurderer
I know you heard of the word I be swervin' and servin' ya
Alertin' ya, while splurtin' a divine speech
Slow the party down so I can spit it
To each I teach mystic lyric, don't stop, you can get it
You better hear it, battle? Quit it!

Unstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc
Unstoppable
Runnin' the game, Chuck and Kris
Unstoppable, bet you didn't know they had grip
Unstoppable
You don't wanna take this risk
Unstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc
Unstoppable
You don't wanna take the risk!

Can the black hear his stepchild, run the mile
Forever like a juvenile, to stay alive
Survivin' in the freestyle, yo hold it down
Walkin' on the wild side, to live or die
Damn another slow song
Yo Money put the record back the FUCK on
No respect for the Usual Suspects, mad teens
Pourin' fire on the gasoline, defeat fiends
Feelin' like fever, I'm gettin' warm
Chalk marks in the rainstorm, children of the gone
Lost and forgotten, minds rotten
The arcade shot em, Channel Zero on the TV got em
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
If you don't know yourself, then you nobody
Do your thing, no bang, in the same damn gang
I never sang, I'm back, but I transmit slang
Silence in the face of violent crews
My rhymes and news be blacker than most blues
Troublin', it all come tumblin', for the strugglin'
Occupations, daily operations stimulation's
Causin' mental violations, minds on vacation
In the middle of Revelation is a nation

Unstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc
Unstoppable
Runnin' the game, Chuck and Kris
Unstoppable, bet you didn't know they had grip
Unstoppable
You don't wanna take the risk!
Unstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc
Unstoppable
Runnin' the game, Chuck and Kris
Unstoppable, bet you didn't know they had grip
Unstoppable
You don't wanna take the risk!
Unstoppable

War at 33 1/3
Haven't you heard
I got quick and clever
At the level of a scientist
With this list my fist pumps chumps
And don't miss
Sorry majority grudgin' against the enemy
And any other nigga wit an attitude see
And any other rapper whose a brother
Who try to speak to one another
Gets smothered by the other kind
No so divine so I heard it through the grapevine
Sent the feds out to get mine
Time yo-yo to go Bronco in 90-91
Laughin' while they're searchin' for my 98

Accelerate the race from the chase
Looka my face
It ain't hate but they don't want a debate
To take great
Can I live my life without 'em treatin'
Every brother like me like we're holdin'
A knife alright time to smack Uncle Sam
Don't give a damn, look at the flag
My bloods a flood
Without credit
Black and close to the edit
I fed it, you read it, just remember who said it
War at 33 1/3 not really live
I rather do it at 45
Went west in the quest for my intelligence
Climbed a fence took a teacher on
Ain't seen him since, hence he winced
And convinced that the Black
Was back revolving to a renaissance
Bronze to gold I told felt bold
Taught a so called teacher our role
In civilizin' the whole globe
Banned unplanned as I said
I don't break down religion why?
There ain't a smidgen for a pigeon
Nature for bird, dog, worm or lion
So my question to man is
So why the lyin'
God's law I saw is natural factual
Only man creates a waste
Defiance in his haste
Based on scheme a scam
From some mastermind damn if we read it
And we see it and still be blind
No need to search a fake church
Evangelical, huster
Anglo taxin' to muscle ya
Check I wreck you guess yes
All the bullshit now that's progress

I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black
Attack so I sack and jack
Then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
 huh
Hear my favoritism roll "Oh"
Never be a brother like me go solo
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm living, forgiven
What I'm giving up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and
Read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though
Signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Changing some ways
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold
Never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows
Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got better get some
 hustler of culture
Snakebitten
Been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fitting
Respects been giving how's ya living
Now I can't protect a paid off defect
Check the record
And reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall
Broke the laws
Not my fault that they're falling off
Known as fair square
Throughout my years
So I growl at the living foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
So welcome to the Terrordome

Subordinate terror
Kicking off an era
Cold delivering pain
My 98 was 87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag
From the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never know or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basing
Traits of hate who's celebrating with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous
Bobbing and weaving and let the good get even
C'mon down
But welcome to the Terrordome

Caught in the race against time
The pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes
While I'm bending 'um
Snakes blowing up the lines of design
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power
Cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
Cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example of one of many cases
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia 
I don't smile in the line of fire
I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums and even violins
Watcha do gitcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad
I put it down on a pad
Give ya something that cha never had
Controlling
Fear of high rolling
God bless your soul and keep living
Never allowed, kicking it loud
Dropping a bomb
Brain game intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team
Never move alone
But
Welcome to the Terrordome

Yo another day
Another forty nine cents

Mr., Mr., why you always tryin' to take all our money

Because I am the government
And you have to pay

Stop tryin' to take our money

Yo, you gotta bust this
We want justice
From public enemy number one
To can't trust this

Like F Jim or Hyatt
Because we're sick and fuckin' tired
Of being mistreated by the undefeated
Power to the seat that can't be beat
Probably gone is the head that make Clinton defeat
Do all the talkin'
Plus crooked walkin'
Blind to the fact
That the enemy is stalking
Ways for days
Search United States quite
Were not a full power
Cause the racial riot
In my neighborhood
We attempt to kill each other
Politics said fuck power to the brother
Be strong be righteous
Don't be no sinister
I got the word from bro. minister 
Farrakhan speaks
And so does Muhammad
The days of Ramagon is
Protect you can harm it
My statement is the fact
To the highest degrees
Flavor works this style, yo can't touch me

Yo, fugess
Rock the house!

Now I don't know
But tell me what you gonna do
When the ending of time comes near
What ever you do
It's gotta be funky
I am not tryin'
To put your life in full of fear
By the favor skies
We are flying
Truth we be buying
To buy out all the lying
How you livin'
Were you livin'
Were you livin'
It ain't got to be like that
By doing the givin'
It was your own choice
Scratched up your Rolls Royce
Every dumb friend you had
Was glad to rejoice
And turned into a nut
Trying to make the pockets fatter
One shoot in the head
Everybody scatter
The worlds gonna
Catch on fire
A funeral buyer
Is a hard heads people desire
Every night you tryer
You turn into a cryer
Who was just in bed
Thinkin' higher, higher
Friends will always move
Till you get the bob wire
Ever common law gets a flat tire

What kind a power we got
Soul power 
Soul power 
Soul power 
Soul power 

What kind a power you got
Soul power
Soul power 

What kind a power we got
Soul power

Tip if politics iz stickin to

Like tricks
I'm one more time givin time
Where the rhyme go
Elite to the street
To the brothas doin death row
So where ya at
If the beat ain't fat
Say what

C'mon
And get some
Rattle rattle
Kiss and I hum
Come can you
Get it on the one
C'mon pick it up
Pick it at
Pack it at
Pack it up
To the black
Who be talkin
Where they at
Where they at
Wicked wild
Feelin irie
Not sorry
Get it see it written down in a diary
Same say fuck all dat
Political shit
But wanna get paid when
Their brains in the second grade

Nowhere to run/here they come come
Nowhere to run/here they come come

I'm a fan first
I reverse another trick verse
To the point
Where I can rock dis funky joint
In the brain game, I'm keepin my head clear
In 33 years so what
I never had a beer
I don't know what I'm missin
I'm not dissin
But I know I ain't ass kissin
Time to draw the line
This time the rhyme
Got da good guy goin gettin da nine
Cause I know the hoody
Got it good wit the hitman
Can I get a hitman
Know I'm duckin nat quicksand
The funky automatic
Handlin static
Sellin out I ain't good at it
& when I got bumbed
I'm gonna open up
Hitt em up stone to da bone
But it ain't gotta be like that

And thats that
Can u tell me yall...what
All in wit the law
They fall in
The great white hole where they
Be sellin their soul
Never get enough
They be talkin dat roughneck shit
Be comin they quit
Fuck dat blood iz ticker
Than water shit
That shit iz counterfeit
Devil go where da shoe fit
Black mans law iz raw like Africa
You violate
Were comin after ya

There here

When flav' starts to get busy
Grabbin' the mic and they say who is he
Cock deezal breakdown like bill bixbie
When I think, yo I think in three sixty
Gimme the mic an I'ma solve all mystery
I dare any punk to try to step up and diss me
'cause when he do, that's when he kiss dee
Titles go by and my style is fly
One more time I came here to rhyme
Gimme the mic and I'ma go for mine
So emcee's all a y'all shut up
When flavor's in the house we say

What what

Let flavor blow it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what

Now when I do my flavor dance
All the ladies go crazy in a trance
Nonstop boy from the clock on my watch
I can bring it from the bottom and take it to the top
Let me rock, come on let me get with it
When I tell you what to get, don't get offended
Gimme the mic and I'ma bend it
Transmissions from the sky yo I'll send it
Times on my hands yo sometimes I lend it
Though I'm spendin' it for a fact
I'll make you say what what
Cause flav's back

What what

Let flavor blow it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what

Now everybody listen to flav
If you don't listen to me you will end up in your grave
Most of these people's rhymes is whack
But I got a bunch of rhymes in my knapsack
Walk on my back with the black hat
Got the rhymes to come on the attack
Can't you tell that I'm really good lookin'
They know me from Miami, California
Back to Brooklyn
Even in Spain they knew flavor's name
In japan they know I'm nice in the game
We maintain yo brothers feel the vibe
We did the first album and it came out fly
And don't ask why you won't understand
Styles we got millions of fans
So come on get down like this what's up
When flavor grab the mic
I will rip your butt

What what

Let flavor blow it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what

Halleluja Jesus, Halleluja!

Now here's the pop, turnaround jumper,
Hits the rim bounce away, the new slave trade.
Manchild, six feet five, but juvenile.
Thin line between getting bucks and gettin' wild.
Brooklyn style, hundred thousand miles.
Parquet tiles, leavin' ankles broke in a pile.
Son got a ticket to fly, he can make it if he try,
To the sky, like a Coney Island ride.
Gettin' pages, from his super agent, 
Community raises at the clout or the cages.
No doubt, center stages, mad phases,
From behind crazies flippin' through the faces.
Paper chases, love that many places.
Pros and cons, flics between the races.
He hold the rock, call for sweat shops.
Guard the set shop replaced by sex shops.
The highest bidder, no room for the quitter.
Gave seven tickets, under counterfeitas.
Three cities a week, droppin' needles.
Like the black Beatles take heed, what you need is 

Jesus 
Jesus 
Jesus
Jesus

Crack my picture, never switch up.
Smack the back ups, pack them pick ups.
Resurrection of the two man vocal section.
The spirit in your dark ass direction.
Duckin' them spray ups on my way that I thought be lay ups.
Won the battle wars, a thousand one push ups.
Here marks the return of them rules about Ruff Ryders.
Risin', chargin' hard from the point guard.
Watch what you prey for, but know the team that you play for.
Need I say more?
Uh, scared of the resurrection,
Sacrifice yours, them maybe the revolution is basketball.
Changes, generanges. 
Which means rearrange shit,
Erase shit, stuck on Playstations. 
Then the new plantations, I said a millions heads.
Waitin' for another nation.
To make your world be free.
No shoppin' sprees, there ain't no stoppin' me.
Here's the fee, not the weed. 
Got to see, God speed. What you need is 

Sticky D gives you fits, on them turnaround Hippocrates.
Comin' and goin' like flics.
Hit em net scripts, like a butcher.
Gettin' all the chips musta been a road trip against the Knicks.
On T.V. showcasin' kicks. 
Must be the fan 'cause his video gettin' all the chicks.
Walk up on a replay on Monday.
Sportscenter highlights, last second steal kept em real.
What you need is 
Jesus
Jesus 
Jesus
Jesus 
Jesus
Jesus 
Jesus
Jesus

This is for the ones that do it
This is for the ones that tell
This is for the ones that's scared
White mans heaven is a black mans hell

This is for the ones that take em
This is for the ones that sell
This is for the ones that OD

This is for the ones on the corner
This is for the ones in the cell
This is for the ones under the ground
White mans heaven is a black mans hell

Black history, white lie
Black athletes, white agents
Black preacher, white Jesus
Black drug dealer, white government
Black entertainers, white lawyers
Black Monday, white Christmas
Black success story, white wife
Black police, white judge
Black business, white accountants
Black record co, white distribution
Black comedians, white media
Black politicians, white president
Black genocide, white world order

So whatcha sayin'

White mans heaven is black mans hell

Once again, this is it
Turn it up
Here we go
But this time the rhyme
Gonna ask who did the crime
Then let's get down to the nitty-gritty
Like I want to know who
Picked Wilson's pocket
Afth, he rocket it
Fact, he shocked it
Same kinna thing they threw at James
An what did to Redd was a shame
The the Black get
The bigger the feds want
A piece of that booty
Intentional rape system, like we ain't
Payed enough in this bitch, that's why I dissed them
I learned we earned, got no concern
Instead we burned so where the hell is our return?
Plain and simp the system's a pimp
But I refuse to be a ho
Who stole the soul?

Ain't, no, different
Than in South Africa
Over here they'll go after ya to steal your soul
Like over there they stole our gold
Yo they say the Black don't know how to act
'Cause we're waitin' for the big payback
But we know it'll never come
That's why I say come and get some
Why when the Black move it, Jack move out
Come to stay Jack moves away
Ain't we all people?
How the hell can a color be no good for a neighborhood
Help, straighten me out
'Cause my tribe gets a funny vibe
They I'm wrong for singin' a song
Without solutions
All the dancers answer questions
And try to be the best and 
Let everybody know before I blow
For the sake of what's right
I want to know who stole the soul?

We choose to use their ways
And holidays notice some of them are heller days
Invented bye those who never repented
For the sins within that killed my kin
But that's all right
I try do what a brother does
But I'll never know if you're my 'cause
That's why I try my best to unite
And damn the rest if they don't like it
Banned from many arenas
Word from the motherland
has anybody seen her
Jack was nimble, Jack was quick
Got a question for Jack ask him
Forty acres and a mule Jack
Where is it why'd you try to fool the Black
It wasn't you, but you pledge allegiance
To the red, white, and blue
Sucker that stole the soul!

Gary G-Wiz, Ridenhour, Studdah Man 

Whole lotta love goin' on
In da middle of what?
Say what?
What's goin' on?

I leave em home alone
Dey turned into danger zones
Studio shootouts, leavin' no doubt
In da eyes of the wise
About the other guys

Fantasy 'n' gettin' that rep
Makin' you move
While they disturb the groove
Now the party's over ooops!
Outta time
Yo my brother can you spare a crime
Some want to take me out
I even call em my own

Rap is a contact sport
Can I get support
When I hum to da maximum
What I talk is straight
From da sidewalk strong

The velt New York
One hundred and twelve beats a minute
An I'm flowin in it
Have no mercy
On da ones that curse me

And when I'm in da paint
The feuding might be over
But the fussin' ain't
Some hate the way I say em
Cause I block em like
Zo to da am
Beginning of an end of an error
Incredible shrinking race

Fiend without a face
Still got love for em
But some ain't got love
For the rest of us

So my boys get iller than
Illinois 
Return to da noise

I'd rather fall off
Than fall victim of crime
And a low percentage rhyme
If I go down they goin' with me
So come and get me c'mon

Behold the whole planet
Upside down I Put it down
Shuttin' down disco clowns
I get around
This rap game's like a sport
Been through two passports
Ass stay up in airports
Black man still gettin' no support
Compensation we ain't seein'
Split by Europeans
Damn treated less than human beings
No matter
Africa, Brazil, East St. Louis or the Caribbean
Traveled the seven seas
Rocked many races
Spread the cash cleaned trash
In a lotta low places

Seen the look of love on many mad faces
When I rhymed about the time
And not the paper chases
People all over the world given mad respect
When I identified who the Government wrecked
What's the SoundScan
Ask the company rep
They don't care
They just about keepin' their checks

Round and round and round we go
Where the worlds headed nobody knows

Hear the crime rhyme created a lotta robots
Can the real lyric fix the shit that the time forgot
Loops gotcha brain gettin' locked
Loaded up with words that never meant a lot
And you can't call the cops
And y'all don't really know
And y'all don't hear me through
Takes a nation of big brains
To break up that flow
And the game ain't changed
But the heads be rearranged
In danger
My language is rappin' in anger
I be bangin' so I point my finger
While we sleep
Racists set us up like sheep
Every time I go someplace
Slaves up in my face
Black people in a plantation state
No control of soul
Wouldn't know our fate
Now Am I wrong to hate hate
Thirty eight countries 51 states now you tell me
Who in the world gonna compensate
A hundred million lost make a nigga wait
Gotta beg the queen to get food on our plate

I am taking no prisoners taking no shorts
Breakin' with the metal of a couple of forts
While we're hearin' that boom supplement the mix
We're gonna rush 'em like the Bears in the 46
Homeboys I don't know but they're part of the pack
In the plan against the man bum rush attack
For the suckers at the door if you're up and around
For the suckers at the door we're gonna knock you back down

 
Yo! Bum rush the show

Searchin' my body for fuckin' what
Cause my gun's just for fun and knife don't cut
How can I make you understand
I still can kill with my goddamn hands
Troubles, not me, I don't mean to cause
But you took one look and began to pause
Didn't holler at the dollar we willin' to spend
But you took one look and wouldn't let our ass in

 

Cold bum rushin' doors like at first it's something
But all we realize that the show ain't nothin'
For the stunts and the blunts, whole world inside
The reason that the mighty used force supplied
No comp, we'll stomp all in our way
Gave me static so I won't pay
It might be a trick that you don't like
Comin' in the side door then grabbin' the mike

Walkin' and talkin' fist full in the air
It might seem like that we don't care
A ho for an oh, a pow for an ow
Girls start screamin' all I say is wow
Get that sucker who shot that gun
Beat his monkey ass till it ain't no fun
5-O showed and wouldn't you know
They blamed it on the kid 'cause all I said was 

In this corner with the 98
Subject of suckers object of hate
Who's the one some think is great
I'm that one, son of a gun
Drivin' by, wavin' my fist
Makin' 'em mad when I'm goin' like this
Top gun, never on the run
They know not to come cause they all get some
Goin' quicker in the speedin' lane
Jealous can't do it and it's causin' them pain
Out the window, middle finger for all
Jealous at my ride, stereo and blackwalls
Suckers got the nerve and gall
To talk 'bout my car when they're walkin' tall
Pullin' away, every day
Leavin' you in the dust
So you know I get paid, on the mile ego trip
And 5-o tailin' on my tip
Watch me burn rubber, fall in my flame
This episode always is the same
Seein' no comp comin' like I'm blind
All left back, tailin' my behind
I go faster cops try to shoot me
They'll get theirs when they try to get me
I'll let go, my turbo
Run, I'm in the river cause they're movin' too slow
Laughin' hard at their attempt
So what if the judge charged me contempt
I'd rub my boomerang, feelin' proud
And I wouldn't even hear them cause my radio's loud

Cruisin' down the boulevard
treated like a superstar
You know the time so don't look hard
Get with it, the ultimate homeboy car
All you suckers in the other ride
When I'm comin' get to the side
My 98 is tough to chase
If you're on my tail, better watch my face
Smoke is comin' when I burn
Rubber when my wheels turn
Tinted windows, super bad
Lookin' like the car the Green Hornet had
It's the reason I'm ahead of the pack
It's the reason I left them back
It's the reason all the people say
My 98-O blows 'em all away
Understand, I don't drive drunk
My 98's fly, I don't drive no junk
No cop gotta a right to call me a punk
Take his ticket, go to hell and stick it
Pull me on a kick but, line up, times up
This government needs a tune up
I don't even know what happenin', what's up
Gun in my chest, I'm under arrest
Sidewalk suckered wanted to spill me
So I got my crew and posse
Step outside, got in my ride
Drove them around, looked around town
Caught I'm out there cold, ran I'm over and down
They didn't get me, that's the truth
Cause my 98-O is bullet proof

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing 'em
I'm taking my life back
Caught in a change
Twenty five to life

I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid
Down and died for you I no longer cried for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
I'm a take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'm a be the boss of you now goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me
Did me a favor although my spirit free you've said
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
Its unfortunate but its

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal
All I do is rap
I can not moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time
You don't think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh,
Now I'm special? Oh, I didn't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your as addictive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away
I'm addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time I'm a
Ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke to people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list

Fuck you hip-hop
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
Twenty five to life

Too late
Caught in a change
Twenty five to life

Oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh ohoh
Oh
Woah
There is no escaping 
There's no place to hide
You scream, someone save me
But they don't pave no mind 

Good bye

Your walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the mornin'
And your in a nightmare
It's horrible
Right there's the coroner
Waitin' for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's on a ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin' in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a klonopin 
While I'm noddin'
In and out on the ottoman
At the ramada inn
Holdin' onto the pill bottle then
Stick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonald's
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
Shit
Guess I must of just blacked out again
Not again

It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em
I said
It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin'
Blood all over the wall panel and dismantlin'
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin'
Grab my flannel and my bandana' then
Kiss the naked manequin' man again
You can see him standin' in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin' hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and not so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Hey the prodigal son
The diabolical one
Very methodical
When I slaughter dem

It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em
I said
It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint fifth of jack
My last vic and a half
A flashlight
Up kim kardashians ass

I remember the first time
I dismembered the family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cousin
And I wrapped him
In christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink his bath water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood curdlin' screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's three am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It ain't no stoppin' me from choppin' him up

It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em
I said
It's three am in the mornin'
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin' all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

Yo

I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless
Patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer 
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And aint shit changed
But kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

It's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
That smashed into your Honda Accord
With a 4 door Ford
But a more toward  droppin an accapella
The choppa  fella
The mozarella
Worse than a hellacopta propella
Got you locked in the cella
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia
While I'm standin next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins
Feeding you liquid darvicet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance
And driven
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
And given
A less than 20 percent chance
Of living
Have a possible placement
It's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson
To set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit 
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit

Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombas 
We blowin up your house killing your parents 
and coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I aint making no more threats
I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack  
today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath
Walk the block with a labrador
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Eye-Kyu: Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Eminem: Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Verse 1: Eye-Kyu
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming 
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show 
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho 
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know

Chorus: Eminem
So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Eye-Kyu: Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

Verse 2: Eminem
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 

Chorus: Eye-Kyu
So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see
Eminem: So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills that you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see

Yo, I'm tryin' to be the man of the day
Three six five a year
See the bullshit you sayin', Skam ain't tryin' to hear 
Bustin' lyrics in the air
Keepin' some up in the chamber

Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin'?

Man, I'm releasin anger!

I'm tryin' to be the illest of the day
Three six five a year
See that bullshit you sayin', Shady ain't tryin' to hear
Spittin' lyrics in your ear
Keepin' some up in the chamber

Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doin'?

I'm releasin anger!

Man I'm tired of bein' tired, everytime I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein' late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin', and endin' up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold diggin' bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin', girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin' like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't come it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now
At every industry party, gettin' so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin' up white rappers like im throwin' gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposi''n the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin' shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber

Chorus

Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last "O" that I snifed off caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turnin' to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screamin' to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin'
You gettin' spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum iternally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock-block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'ma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

Chorus

"What! What! What!"
Yeah nigga! It's D12 up in this motherfucker!
You know how we get nigga we wild in the club
Motherfuckers, everybody get crunk in Detroit too nigga!
So wile the fuck out!

Pour your forty out.  
Pour your forty out. 
Pour your forty out. 
Pour your forty out. 
Pour your forty out. 
Pour your forty out. 
Pour your forty out. 
Pour your forty out. 
Bitch!

We fucked up,
Let us in the club.
One of why'all niggas gon' catch a slug, 
I'm so drunk I could hurl for a month.
Any nigga pop shit, go to the trunk.
D12 start shit, nigga come get us,
Seven mile Runyan, wild niggas wit us,
Cause all my niggas is talkin' that shit.
Ain't got no problem, with smackin no bitch.
I'll have my wife, cut your throat.
Blunts, gans, that's all we smoke
Wild the fuck out, stab you with a knife,
It's D12 nigga, we ready to fuckin' fight.

Who tryin' to be the first one to catch this plate in the throat!
You know the po-po don't let me hold them toasters no mo'
I just cut three people, you gon' be number four
If you don't back the fuck up, and get the fuck up off the flo'.
My crew is takin' over as soon as we hit the do'
You hit the door then we comin' in and you goin' home.
Security that can't even stop us because they know,
Runyan Avenue soldiers hold it down wherever we go.
Suckin' on our forty's and holdin' up .44's.
We come with toasters like we just opened saving's and loans.
And we don't need your brew tonight homie we brought our own.
So grab whatever you sippin' on and let's get it on!!!!

We deep as a motherfuck, we 'bout to get it crunk
You just another punk in the club about to get jumped
I settle my vendettas with AK's, Berettas
We don't supposed to be in here with our weapons but still they let us.
Switchblade, brass knuckles, nickel plated belt buckle.
Broken beer bottles, when we walk in you can smell trouble.
Elbows flying, niggas crying, niggas bleeding, you retreating.
Run into your car and skatin off, We G'ing
We make example out of you haters runnin' your mouth.
You the reason why your peoples is pourin they 40z out.
Dirty Dozen whiling, beat niggas bloodied.
And you gon' have to pour out a keg for all your homies.

I was raised by drunks, so I became a drunk.
Eighty proof for this rocker, that's the name I want.
I'm in the club to beef, you gotta murder me then
Only talk to a bitch with burgundy hair.
Or the aisle in the back, bump a seven deuce.
See that top on that forty, you know it's comin' loose.
See me on the Av. daily, we runnin' this shit.
If your chick get loud, I g-money that bitch.
Packin' mags and clips, I'll smash your clique.
Because of Proof they put the "G" in the alphabet.
Smoking weed, drinking henny, remy, in that jimmy
Don't worry if we run out the corner store got plenty.

Of course I rap till I'm hoarse
Add the sauce to them dry turkey m.c.'s
Say what you like, I toss
In theory when you hear me
Like the guts of the Dutch
Snap caught you in the act like Vivitar
AF 2-5-5 auto-focus clear vision
Precision mics for people of all types
Call the cavalry
My brutality switch the pitch gradually
Aqua turntable knocka
Fresh like binocca
Jot the thoughts in my chronicles
Remarkable styles Shadeeq taxed it
Make an exit to spark mine
Nuclear physics with cannibals and phat rhymes
They know the time like it's a sundial, X-File

Went to bible class with a gun
Blasted a nun
Fuck hell, Satan sent my ass to the sun
I wasn't born I was hatched
And dumped in the trash
With a note attached saying
Someone please whip this brat's ass
I never gave a rat's ass or a flying fuck
Driving drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
Slammin the brakes
Skiddin out 'cause the tires suck,
Went to pull you off my dick
And got the pliers stuck
You better run 'cause I'm probably the only one
Crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife
And stab you with a gun
I like fire, you might see me start it
I'm slightly retarded
I miss my sanity since the night we departed

Oldworlddisorder on some outnumbered shit
We rather go outta control then to be under it
Yo, how you goin against us
when we got nothin to loose?
Must be confused
Prayin' to a god that don't exist
that wouldn't save yo bible kissin asses
even if he did
we like to twist the misted 
Genetic dead end
don't got friend
Skam is chatter man
posin children for depression
Stressin ANY language
say my name IN SPANISH

suck the life outta you-ou
There won't be enough of your brain left
to fill a tea spoon
We two vanishin man that make the bad things blend
and probably go platinum on the day that the world ends

When it comes to beef
I get relieved when I kill it brief
Send you a reef
get your family ready for grief
I knock your teeth
take a seat like a thief
Make a change of release
burn or leave before you go beneath
Rappers I kill em
down is to hell is where I send them villain
My plan is illin so much I need some penicillin
Cats is spillin cause I'm down here
kickin shit that's solitaire
you crown is rip
cause rapper you sound counterfeit
You get a round of clips
if you play hard
you stay scarred
Thinking of graveyard
you're in a caveyard
One in the mill
son I'm ill when it comes to skills
wanna get killed and catch a dum dum in your grill
Rappers diminishing is I get to the finish
I'm speaking English
while your brothers is speaking in gibberish
You touch a mic and
I'm out to bury your fingers
You want some fame?
I'll beat you up in front of Jerry Springer
So pay the price
say the nice
when I pay the dice
I take your life
slay it twice before your arrive

Them cats who ride are feminine,
I'm singing this without,
the benefit sense of cinnamon,
So submit it in your mental
Since you find it essential to sub the sentence
in sentence
this sentence is simple
you banned from using writing utensils
Whether cry line, crayon pen or pencil
observe verse with syntax
that causes skin cracks on impact
Send a rap shot before I spark back 
and then send them whack men
way back to the lab to add what most of them lack
I can hand you a manual of what I plan to do to you more tangible,
you still wouldn't understand the full concept
it slips through your fingers like sandgranuals
Skam will land, and we'll hand
and a blue sea annually
and you will see which animal me,
and fifty of us spittin up that written stuff
It's all the same and
is the reason for cyphas prematurely spittin up
Ironic, phonic flow fo sho 
my flow is far from enbionic
to be honest when I'm on the chronic antibiotic
I'm beyond it!
The texture of my lecture is complex like a professor's
Scepticals think I'm exceptional when I bless sound recepticals,
What runs through my vest
To be turns crews to vegetables
then grab my testicles and cup em
fuck em, let's see whose fucked!

Sometimes I just feel like
Quitting I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
Sometimes I want to jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right
Hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright
Drawing a blank like

Dah, dah, dah. dah
It ain't my fault
Great then I fall
My insides crawl
And I clam up
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I have just been ripped
So I must then get
Off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit
Yo, I'm going the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man
I'm a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Walking these train tracks
Tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap
Gotta move ASAP
Get a new plan
Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad
Ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset 'cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep, my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please, I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are
Yo, I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man
Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

You gotta live it to feel it
You didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is
Why it was and it still is
To be walking this borderline of Detroit's city limits
It's different and it's a certain significance
A certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You'd never seen, heard, smelled or met a real mc
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet still unsigned
Having a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line
When it comes crunch time
Where did my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet
I'm starting to doubt shit
I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with
I live like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit
And it's cold
Trying to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode
My defenses are so up
The one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
This city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs
By each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me want to jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not
What I'm doing, I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to u-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl
I can not only play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur
I'm Eight Mile Road

I'm a man
Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Yo, it's time to get rid of this coward right here once and for all.
I'm sick of the motha fucka! Check this shit out!

Yo! I'll spit a racial slur, honky, sue me!
This shit is a horror flick, but a black guy doesn't die in this movie!
Fuckin' wit Lotto, dawg, you gotta be kiddin!
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin!
You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say?
I got a better chance joining the KKK.
On some real shit, though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck 'Lotto,' call me your leader
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from "Leave It to Beaver"
I used to like that show, now you got me in 'fight back' mode
But oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go!
I hate to do this; I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well that ends ok?
So I'll end this shit with a "Fuck you, but have a nice day!"

Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskal, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid!
Quick, someone get his ass another steroid!
"Blahbity bloo blah blah blahbity blooh blah!"
I ain't hear a word you said, "hipidy hooblah!"
Is that a tank top, or a new bra?
Look Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boob job!
Didn't you listen to the last round, meat head?
Pay attention, you're saying the same shit that he said!
Matter fact, dog here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful,
And don't come back until something dope hits you
Fuck it! You can take the mic home with you!
Looking like a cyclone hit you,
Tank top screamin', "Lotto, I don't fit you!"
You see how far them white jokes get you?
Boys like 'How Vanilla Ice gonna diss you?'
My motto: Fuck Lotto!
I'll get the 7 digits from your mother for a dolla' tomorrow!

Now everybody from the 313 
Put your mother fucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313 
Put your mother fucking hands up'look, look

Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This free world's got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1Pac, 2Pac, 3Pac, 4
4Pac, 3Pac, 2Pacs, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, No Pac; none
This guy aint no mother-fuckin MC,
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me,
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun,
I did get jumped, by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
Don't never try to judge me dude 
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter dawg, you embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster; he's real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as half-way crooks'
He's scared to death, he's scared to look 
In his fucking yearbook, fuck Cranbrook

Fuck a beat, I go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly 
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie, 
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me.

This guy's a choke artist
Ya catch a bad one
Your better off shootin yourself
With Papa Doc's handgun
Climbin up this mountain your weak
Ill leave you lost without a paddle
Floatin shits creek

You ain't Detroit, Im the D
Your the new kid on the block
Bout to get smacked back to the boonedocks
Fuckin Nazi, this crowd ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music

Trailor trash, Ill choke you to your last breath
And have you lookin foolish 
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his asscrack
And when you actin up thats when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up

Ill crack your shoulder blade
Youll get dropped so hard 
Elvis will start turnin in his grave
I dont know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile
To the trailor park

This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Eric Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
Its all dudes in here, except for these bitchs
So Im a German, Eh
Thats ok, you look like a fuckin worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies

Talkin bout shits creek
Ho, you could be up piss creek 
With paddles this deep
Your still gonna sink
Your a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit
This is a turtle race

He can't get with me spittin this shit
Wickedly lickety shot
Spickety spickety split lickety
So Im gonna turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 mile!

Featuring Eminem and B Real

WAAAHHHOOOOOO , hahaha 
guess who's back !?
mommy , we're home
say hello to my little friends , DJ Muggs , Soul Assassins , Cypress Hill
everybody , put your hands where my eyes can see

everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck , forty fifty Samoans , they knowin' when D-Bo was
50 , Tweezy , Obie there won't be no hoe in us , they pop shit like they gon' do shit but no one does
from New York down to Texas , back up to Los Angeles , we've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
you may end up gettin' rushed by too many to handle us , it's funny I guess money does have its advantages
and it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched , it's not like we're just feelin' ourselves that much
it's just , that if someone ever does put us in the clutch , we just know that y'all ain't gon' be the one who's gon' do it
cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that , you fuck around get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
that you got no business being in , we ain't even gon' be in it , no one's gonna hear nothin , no one's gonna see this shit
and they'll be in and up out of it , them boys is bout it , bout it , the noise from  be drowned out by the crowd
and you'll be layin' on the ground gettin' trampled by people dancin' , till the club closes and clears out
and that's when they see you flatened , nobody saw it happen , all cause your jaws are flappin'
and you couldn't stop yappin' and took it past rappin' , it ain't about the music no more , it's about tryin' to show off
and it feels like any minute the bomb is about to go off

shit's about to change , cause we ain't playin' no games
we ain't budgin' neither are they , we ain't sayin' no names
shit just ain't the same , when the K's get to scream
hip hop is in a state of 911
it ain't about hip hop , cause those days are gone
it ain't about tryin rip shots , to get props no more
it's about tryin' not to get popped , and get dropped to the floor
cause hip hop is in a state of 911

step off my holster cause shit it's gettin' serious , all these drugs you be fuckin' with make you delirious
thinkin' you coming with heat , yo son I'm curious , how long are you gonna hate us and judge us and jury us ?
some people can never fade us , that make us so furious , mistake us for fakers , homie we great but glorious
we livin' for real and others just makin' the stories up , allusions are broken , so live it up , you corny fucks
if you take a fuckin' minute to think about what you've done , when you stood against the gangsta who live and die by the gun
got a hot one , sprayin' you bitches till there is none , i'm like a rolling stone homie , I got you under my thumb
you silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches , we cut you and give you stitches , for envy and all my riches
your game's just like a midget , you're clockin' a small digit , dealin' with the Giant Goliath , people that's how we live it , c'mon

uh , gangsta gangsta who come to pay you a visit , on this shit you call hip hop , this function is where did it
when I put it in motion , my focus is gettin' branded , my appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
got you stumblin' for cover , this music dyin' in numbers , but you wouldn't pause and wonder , admittin it's all glamour
when you enter the business you thinkin' you runnin shit , you witness that funny shit , your bitches they ain't shit
we gangstas we blast first , ask questions later , all these imitators parading like they some playaz
tryin' to save hip hop the task is somethin greater , cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
get caught , I'm not tellin' , or more like killin' not caring , i'm ridin' a gangsta feelin' , no fearing when gangstas dyin'
I'm in a full circle with homies that supposed to bleed , on an 8 mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

Just the two of us... 

Baby your da-da loves you 
And I'm a always be here for you  no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell  da-da musta runned over a skunk

Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it 

And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you want to help da-da build a sand castle? 
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat

It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
Dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us... 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us... 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... 
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
'Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson

And you don't want a brother do ya? 
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad

She was bein' mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out 
I told you it's okay HaiHai, want to ba-ba?

Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us... 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us... 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... 
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear 

That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you want to help da-da tie a rope around this rock? 
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock

Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! 
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order

No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her 
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us... 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... 
Just you and I!
Just the two of us... 
And when we ride!
Just the two of us... 
Just you and I!

Just the two of us... 

Just me and you baby
Is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you

Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby

It's shit like this I kick to these rich white kids
Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is
Ooops I did it again didn't I my shit's harder
To figure out than what Britney's tit size is
Oooh I probably pissed you off again didn't I bitch
So what Christina Gaguilera kiss my grits
You know how many shit's I get if I wish I did
So I can quit givin these twisted little kids ideas
This just in, Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit fucked and dick sucked him
If Afflec can get his ass licked, how I can't shit
Goddamn bitch I'm rich I can't understand this
Are those pictures they made of us together on the internet
As close as I'm ever gonna get to hittin it from the back
And shit when it comes to that I hit harder from the back
Than Everlast when he's pluggin Lethal in his fuckin ass
Just give me one more chance Britney hit me one more time
Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line
To sniff, you fuckers know what time it is
Fuck your jewelery my record's almost diamond, BEEOTCH!

What's goin on in the world today
People fightin, feudin, lootin, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre- It aint nuttin but music

Eminem doesn't like N'Sync, well I do
So fuck him, and the Backstreet Boys too
Whatever happened to the cast of Different Strokes
Mary's broke, Ty's snortin coke, and then an overdose
I got two little boys wit me
Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me
I'm up early wit my hair curly
Me and Mr. Furly, fuckin Laverne and Shirley!

Alotta rappers are livin in la la land
That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha men
As bad as a life I had, I'm not mad
I don't need to be a jackass to beat up my dad
My whole family's country, my grandmother's old fashioned
And she keeps askin me why I rap wit a honky
But grannie I'm a flunky I could be a junky
I could be hangin with the hoochies out at the club scene

To all the independent women in the house! 
Show us your tits and shut your motherfuckin mouth! 

Robert Downey, Bobby Brownie, Whitney Houston
The shit's confusin 
Jesse Jackson, reverend scandal
Got George Michael's, Tevin Campbells
PeeWee Herman's, peep show places
Public restrooms, peep those cases

Huh, your mom and dad probably mad at us 
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers
Aint like where I'm from, we don't bite our tongue
Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns
It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme
Where you work you aint gettin paid for that overtime
It's only music, media know it but they blind
I aint in your light, so stay they hell up outta mine
Y'all the reason why Princess Diana ended up dyin
If you people get offended I don't care 
Tryin to get us to leave cuz what we say just aint clean 
But holdin back on what I say just aint me

Now what's these parents all mad for? 
For teenage kids that drink more than Ted Danson in Cheers
Carson drink beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch 
Broke or rich, I still do that same old shit
I don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit
So when they ask me about my sarcasticness
I just slap 'em, turn around and ask 'em this

 

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now 
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now 

Let's pretend like its '98
Like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane 
And everybody know my name 
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now 
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now 

Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now let's pretend like it was all-good
Like I didn't live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didn't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now 
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now 

(And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream 
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone)

Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that 
Was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it, 
Makes no sense to play the game it ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move in school no changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to shit quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the rap Olympics
He slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and W-I-C shit
'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even hear it he pretends that

Airplanes
In the night sky
Is like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now 
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now 

I can almost taste it
This shit makes no sense to me
What is it all mean
I can almost taste it
I can almost tame it

This shit makes no sense to me
What is it all mean
I can almost taste it

Yeah, can't stop now

This maybe the last time I get,

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
I wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You can not fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but
Be careful what you wish you for

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His bridges, he out grow'd em
He's so out cold he's knocked out of the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigamortis and post-mortem
He's dying of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em
Then try to flaunt 'em
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit stained drawers
You gon' fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some prank calls
You think I'm backing down you must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
I wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You can not fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but
Be careful what you wish you for

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
You call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole 'nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it, you were just in his C-D's
Laugh at infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady E-P's got the attention of the mighty D-R-E
He is almost famous

You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You can not fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
I wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You can not fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but
Be careful what you wish you for

Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls
Screaming the wood off the panel
And cussing the pain off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these brauds
He ain't given them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the LeBron so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, till Abraham Lincoln is screaming out ah
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can get a belt or neck tie, to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman girl
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
And while I'm being poetic let me get a stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these winners and lords
So bare witness to some biblical shit
As a cold wind blowing this world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous

(Kill, kill, kill

Mentally ill from Amityville 
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will 
Mentally ill from Amityville

I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash whiskey and ash til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me you'll get in imagine this

Mentally ill from Amityville 
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will 
Mentally ill from Amityville

Mentally ill from Amityville 
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will 
Mentally ill from Amityville

I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope?
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was 'sleep
Pissy-drunk, throwin up in the urinal 
That's what I said at my dad's funeral

Mentally ill from Amityville 
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will 
Mentally ill from Amityville

Mentally ill from Amityville 
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will 
Mentally ill from Amityville

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin' idiots still 
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit he gets killed 
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville 
You can get capped after just havin' a cavity filled 
That's why we're crowned the murder capital still 
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger Hill! 
We don't do drive-by's, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fuckin' shoot it out with them too!
That's the mentality here  that's the reality here 
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? 
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? 
Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year? 
'Cause once I snap I can't be held accountable for my actions
That's when accidents happen,
When a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you and they found you
And your family in it 
God dammit, he meant it when he told you!

Mentally ill from Amityville 
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will 
Mentally ill from Amityville

Mentally ill from Amityville 
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinkin' he won't? God-damnit he will

But I gotta go, it's time for me to go and pick up
Jessica, it's official I just broke her and Nick up

Hi! 
Original Bad Boy on the case cover your face 
Came in the place blowed and sprayed Puffy with Mase 
I laced the weed with insect repellant better check the smelly 
Eminem starts with E better check the spelling 
With a capital somebody grab me a Snapple 
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple 
Somebody dropped me on my head and I was sure 
That my mother did it but the bitch won't admit it was her 
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months 
And said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?" 
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell 
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell 
I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphillis germs 
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns 
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach 
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it 
 Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet 
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it 
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it 
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it 

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha? 
Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi! 
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me? 
Is fuckin crazy 

I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin 
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym 
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias 
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens 
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium 
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian 
A highly combustible head, spazmatic 
Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed 
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition 
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician 
High speed, IV full of thai weed 
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese 
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians 
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins 
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends 
On if I keep on killin my girlfriends 

'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha? 
Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi! 
'Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan 
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin 
Is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me? 
Is fuckin crazy 

Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust 
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed 
 I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say 
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play 
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day 
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be  
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin 
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine 
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin 
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been" 
"It's probably AIDS!" Forget it then 
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows 
That don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos 
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats 
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus 
Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded 
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it 
Damn!

yeah
Oh shit, it's the evil genius 
Green lantern

A yo Em
Ha ha

The invasion

with midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle
that will do anything to throw dirt on my name 
if it means walkin the whole Mediterranean
isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
his name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry wow
but that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe
rappin in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo, so
either except it or you don't and lets move on 
if I've shown that I've grown and get the bone 
keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts

or should I say asses 
what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses

hold up hold up hold up

and it u hearin what I'm hearin right now 
you know this aint no regular shit homy

lets go

I got a riddle what's little and talks big
with midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle
that will do anything to throw dirt on my name 
if it means walkin the whole Mediterranean
isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
his name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry wow
but that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe
rappin in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo so
either except it or you don't and lets move on 
if I've shown that I've grown and get the bone 
keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts 
keep walkin around sniffin each others butts 
or should I say asses 
what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
the question I ask is 
how can I explain this 
how can I swing this in English language 
if I switch to slang and turn man to man 
do I do it in vain or simply to entertain 
am I bein real or am I bein fake 
am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine 
or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter 
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya 
I'm tell ya one me gain this is the environment that I was brought up in 
but every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration 
or should I say or should I say shun 
is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism 
your face is numb your stunned your look is cold 
like that of a man of seventy some years old 
and it only gets colder which Is why I understand 
and cant be mad at a forty four year old fan 
with a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine 
and the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again 
only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown 
papa cant stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down 
in his new chair that goes round and round 
that he bought from new money in his bank account 
that I get him every issue when the thang comes out 
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out 
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side 
yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide 
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride 
but aint nobody over here buyin two white guys disguised as pro black
there is no slack 
far heart for college grat. In a fitted hat and a hunch back 
standin by the clearance coat rack 
in some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs 
yeah
shady in the place to be c 
and it takes what I got to rock the mic right 
still not gonna cater these punks 
fuckin cocksuckin pussy lips haters dicks cunts

If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning, so definite, wait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Mama to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things, time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset, I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow then a breath, machines go
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm trying to rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin', now I know

I don't know why this world keep turning 
Round and round

But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

I don't know why this world keep turning

Round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

I hang with a bunch of hippies
And wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
And light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
'cause we're dope as fuck and only get a two in the source
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool, takin' a shit, in the warm pool
'til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin 
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers
Slappin' teachers, and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin'
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed
May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast 
Yeah bitch you so big
You walked into Big Panties and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin' 
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair
Drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

I don't know why this world keep turning 
Round and round

But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a two in The Source
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blonds be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said "What up, its nice to meet ya"
I'd like to treat ya to a bagel and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money
And don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinkin' ass is too fat to try to outrun me
I went to grab my gun
That's when her ass put it on me
Wit' an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors
Started causin' a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin' crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I want to kill her
But so I gotta catch her first
Ran threw alleys, parkin' lots, and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in
And shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!
You might as well come out now
She said "Come in, its unlocked!"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said "Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Den den den den den den, go go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted "Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death 

Come here bitch!
Come here!
Take this motherfuckin' dick!
Bitch, come here!

I don't know why this world keep turning

Round and round

But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

I don't know why this world keep turning

Round and round

But I wish it would stop and let me off right now

I don't know why this world keep turning

Round and round

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost to good to be true
I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing doing doing

The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams
I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'mma answer
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Please, I'm a human being!
I have needs! I'm NOT done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer! I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B, I sing song
It go Ring-a-Chong, a-Ching-Chong-Chong-Chong-Ching
Psych! I joke, I joke! I keed, I keed!
If I offend, I'm sorry! Please, please, forgive!
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away anything I say and you will love it!

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing doing doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen a ass like that
Everytime I see that show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
Doing doing doing

Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? Geez, I just got my seat!
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped!
Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man

Cause there's a puppet on my hand

The way you shake it, I can't believe it

The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen her butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing

The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'? My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me! No, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word 'pee-pee'
Pee, on the radio but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Psych! I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick!
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Ah-nuld, get dowwwn!

The way you shake it, I can't believe it

Doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me please
I ain't never seen a - ass like that
Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing

The fuck is wrong with you?
Ha!

Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked'sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
'Cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I am always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinking: "If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him."
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit what I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawing more attention toward it
'Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, and I just zoned out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
'Cause I was tryin' to leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history
Think they know now, because everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Thanks for the support, asshole!
Thanks for the support, asshole!

Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, but Goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt'word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a Goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo! My soul's escapin'
Through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole, and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac
In fact there they go tryin' to dip out the back-door, retreatin'
'Cause everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch!
How do fuckin' magnets work?"
'Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
'Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
'Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind
Like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
'Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
'Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
'Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuckin' Father Time, it ain't never gonna stop
A pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup
So now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I'm going back to what got me here, yeah, cocky
And can't knock being rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go
People wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows

One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one "ouch"
What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
With a scythe
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming
Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
They took away dinner
Sugar Ray Leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's interesting to spit
Whose king of this fucking English Lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian?
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat 'cause I'm famished
Every deed is a dastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

So step inside of dimension
The demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine
While I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention
I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one
Who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences
Lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary
I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it
I'm an enigma
Fuck it let's get to the meat, balls
I'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes
Edgamacater, they are
Shit legends are madea
Spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretchedness is
What you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
And combine em' with Method Man and Redman
Whit meth-amphetamines in his left hand
And in his right there's a sledge-hammer
And pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off dead jam
Maybe I need my head examined
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds!
Swear to god 'cause If I go off the edge
T.I ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb at a fart, ah nah
More like a smart slob, part blob
That'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject
To the heart and leave claw marks
All over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better then being
King of the playground
I hate the swings but I love being the underdog
'Cause when I'm pushed
I end up swinging up

Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

'Cause nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
'Cause that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya

Police voice:
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's 
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

Verse 1:
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks

Chorus:
Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you fuckin backstabber
Stay away from him he ain't no good

Verse 2:
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

Chorus:
Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you fuckin backstabber
Stay away from him he ain't no good

Verse 3:
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"

Chorus:
Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you fuckin backstabber
Stay away from him he ain't no good

Verse 4:
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place' went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

Chorus:
Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you fuckin backstabber
Stay away from him he ain't no good

Verse 5:
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

Police voice:
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?

Chorus:
Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you fuckin backstabber
Stay away from him he ain't no good

It's like I'm in the dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burned, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy

And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshiped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pain of resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause to my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone

I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
Hate to be the bad guy

I've been driving around your side of the town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack of a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back as they suck

It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by Eminem
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror

Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, Lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!

I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again

Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds, toilets clogged
Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult there
With the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mather's the rapper's persona's have a facade and
Matthew and Stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
I'm the hindsight to say, 'I told you so!'
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call you
The biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
But it's time to walk away
I'm ever guilt trip the baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop

So one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers' left off

The Wild Gotham
The Wild West 
Ha ha, ride

All you see is the sun, reflectin' off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a {blunt} rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said

You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin' the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die

He was "Shady," I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
 {*imitating Slick Rick*}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned

I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you

The Chronic!

Who?

Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle 
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun 

This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin' around sayin' he took the game from us

But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps

I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a "G Thang,"
And a verse from "Keep Their Heads Ringin"
I said "It's Dre's Day," and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way

That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled

Always die
The Wild Gotham
The Wild West 
Ha ha, ride

We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue lashing, then you
Laughed at the stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through 
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different 
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused
Because

How come you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults, they got, thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin' still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

How come you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband  
Forever be a hero in my eyes 
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard "Mockingbird"
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole nother
Shit, it's no wonder

How come, how come, you can be a Lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband  
Forever be a hero in my eyes 
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just adding to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it 

Hand me an .8
Beam me up and land me in space 
I'ma sit on top of the world {I'm here}
And shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white journalist
In a room with Lauryn Hill {ahhh}
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot
And people goin' feel me cuz I'ma still be 
the mad rapper whether I got money or not {yup}
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht
But I would like an award 
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a No Limit tank looks like 
a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit I'm a grave danger to my health 
Why else would I kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself

{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it 
{Just let it go!}

I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Rosco beating James Tar Senior 
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch}
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person 
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps 
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not?  Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

{Just let it go}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as I do
Go ahead get mad and do it 
{Just pull the plug!}

My laser disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face 
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go untill your brains 
are rippin' out your skull so bad
to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "Role Model," I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe Kim's got
And the shit's almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I know that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And Just the Two of Us 
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic. 
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch

I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts 
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon 
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over 
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em 
Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen 
Got murdered in cold blood 
That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home 
They say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern 
And on a quiet night 
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9\"

I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet 
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat 
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph 
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head 
Trapped him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed 
Til' the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead 
Told him each one of his boys is dead 
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said 

Who hard? yo I done heard worse 
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other 
To see which one will swerve first 
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds 
That of a globe, on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil 
Intelligence level is 'hell-ier' than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto 
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist 
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse 
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse 
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis in the nations 
Collaborating, attemptin' to take over the earth 

'Cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
We hit the trees til' we look like Vietnamese people 
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Seagal 
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either 
 
We ain't eager to be legal 
So please leave me wi't the keys to your Jeep Eagle 
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts 
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle 
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain  
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off 
'Cause I can't find a decent vein

The disaster wit' dreads 
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough 
To kill my soul after I'm dead 
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter 
'Cause I serve any stranger wit' money 
I spray a hundred, men until they joint chains 
While slippin' bullets at point blank range like they was punches 
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral 
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws 
Wit' my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass 
I'm blazin' MC's, at the same time amazin' MC's 
Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me 
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche 
And bust till volcanoes erupt 

Hello?  
'Ay-yo what's up  
Stop they know it's us! 

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?  
I'm the one who burned your house down  
Well I'm out now 
And this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up 
And I ain't gonna leave you a window to jump out of 
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms 
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms 
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave 
I'm a put air in a bag and charge people to breathe 

'Cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people 
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Seagal 
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel 

 
See you in hell 
Wall Street, 
Royce Da 5'9, Slim Shady 
See you in hell for the sequel  
Bad meets evil, what? 

And so that's the story when bad meets evil 
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county 
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens 
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did 
Got shot in the back comin' out of that ol' saloon 
But their spirits still live on to this day 
Shh, wait, did y'all hear that?

Oh! It's music to my ears, oh man!
How can I describe, the way I feel?
Fuckin' great man! Okay, let me see
How could I begin

Locked in Mariah's wine cellar all I had for lunch
Was red wine, more red wine, and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up an in between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what's ever happened to us, why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really ask for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty breakup with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want to bag ya punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rappin' pump
Zappin Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that ya want
I mean I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick you had your fun
I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sakes he's crazy, to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on, 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman, holding a Glad bag

You can be a permanent fixture
In my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whip trickster
My signature sound, when the tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
Man what an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma
Ceuticals, it's beautiful, pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touching the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my mama
I'll cut you like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword boy, I'm like a fuckin' Red Sonia
Get it stuck in your cornea
Nice knowin ya Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin
Drop the shovel boy, you don't know what the fuck ya doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born
Snuck up on Malachai and made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck of, shuck of corn, shuck of corn
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fuckin' on
What the fuck are you doin'
You're runnin' over the snow blower
With the lawnmower, blow on your
Bagpipes from Baghdad

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sakes he's crazy, to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on, 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman, holding a Glad bag

In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molesting you
Titty fucking you 'til your breast nipple
Flesh, tickles my testicles
Is what they said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?
You need some ointment, just make an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins wit
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
An attempt to seperate 'em and stitch em back at the loin shit
Lured the little boy with the chocolate Chips Ahoy chip
Cookie, lookie even took me a polaroid, bitch

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease, for Pete's sakes he's crazy, to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind half the time, when I rhyme, while blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on, 'cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman, holding a Glad bag of bagpipes from Baghdad

Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to get the party start
We used to mix hen' with Bacardi dark
And when it kicks in, you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and probably barf
And my prediction is you're probably fall
Either in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything spinning 
You're beginnin' to think like a woman
Are swimming in pink linen
Again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it,and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a forty-two-car pileup
Earth calling pilot to copilot
Looking for life on this planet,sir, no sigh of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might dieif go by it
Let me out of this place I'm outta place
I'm in outer spaceship just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow 
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Some geek keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't want to, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell them

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick that mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
And I ended up in this position I'm in
I starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips, with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
I know some shits so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, copy, one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it'd be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation, like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking manservant
Follow me around, and wiping my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny like
Haha Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes
And you don't have to walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it'd be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you

Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
Flip them, don't expect no help, now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
But take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own, I was never the type of kid
To wait but I know to unpack his bags
Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid, Aunt Edna always told me
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there
Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on the frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Is probably a hundred and ten percent different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes, at least
What size you where? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it'd be like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what I'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you so

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me, are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you

Yea, to my babies. Stay strong. Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, God gave you the shoes
That fit you, so put em on and wear 'em
And be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny,
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful

I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman, ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time 
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes 
Another day in the life 
Used to have to scrape to get by 
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi 
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky 
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time, bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit'tick, tick, tick'no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC'wick, wick, wick'with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice 
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your fuckin' switch, nothin' can compare

Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost in my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that apron and mo'
'Tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans left you two-faced at the show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de gr'ce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and  all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and  all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody  shake your body

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, gang bang bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
P-p-p pow-pow chicka-chicka wow-wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow, bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel tow
Dumb it down, I don't know how  how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and  all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and  all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody  get your vials

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, kangols and Carhartt, these Cargos
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and  all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and  all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody  get your vials

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody  get your vials

I don't understand
Why are you bein' so mean!?
You're a mean, mean man!

You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say

All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you want to be
'So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of a sort
I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close em'
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why do they make you who
Pibbity-cock-a-poo-poo
Syke, I'm kidding I just wanted to see if you're still listening
OK now I need your un-divided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this,
Undeniable tension from the moment I enter into the room?
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversations why am I always mentioned?
I been dying to ask, it's been itching at me
Is it just because

You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was
I fucked up,
Syke, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't it?
That I could bust one take
Without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth OK
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
You're mouth is open,
You're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch,
A bunch of sweets or somethin'
What you munch a bunch of crunch-a-munch?
You're tooth is rottin' through the gum
Your breath stinks,
Want to chew some gum?

You sir are on truth serum
[Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed
I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out
Why I'm saying all these terrible, evil, and awful
Mean things, is my own insecurities!

You're just jealous of me
Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like
When he takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like
Want to check to see? Here's a mirror
Notice the resemblance here?
Wait let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how bout' now
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em'
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you
I know you're not happy,
I know you'd much rather see me lying
In the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind dying
There's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like stickin' a banana between 2 oranges
Why are you even doin' this to yourself?
It's pointless,
Why do we have to keep on going through this?
This is torturous
My point is this, that if you say mean things,
You're weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a

You're just jealous of me
'Cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meany, a meany
But it's only cause you're just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be
So you just look like a idiot
When you say these mean things
'Cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

Fuck off my dick

Justin? It's Zoe.
Kelly did not have me call, however
I just listened to Eminem in her car and
It is the most disgusting thing I have ever heard in my entire life.

And I seriously wanna call his fucking agent
And tell him how fucking disgusting he is
It, like, makes me upset and
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch.
Bitch fuck you
Goodbye.

Yeah what-up Detroit?
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh-no he didn't!
Ah! They didn't do it again,
What-what, what-what?
Did you shit on these niggas two times Dr. Dre?
Oh fo' sure!
Uh-uh, naw, ya smell that?
This is special right here
What-what, what-what-what?
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby
Uh, to the boogie-oogie-oogie,
Yeah, you know! What's crackin' Dre?

Just let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit 
Throw on 'Guilty Conscience' at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
 Some of these crowds that Slim draws
Is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and full of cars
Some of these crowds, me and Snoop draw, is niggas from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
 You and what army could harm me?
D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach
 Came a long way, to makin' these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uz', and I carry it all day
 Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just bein' Andre,
But I

Somehow, someway tell 'em, nigga
You know about Dogg-ay 
Now let me cut these niggas up and show em where da fuck I'm comin from
I get the party crackin' from the shit that I be spittin' son
Hit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns, and I love all of 'em the same, bang bang!
Damn baby girl what's your name?
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn a nigga buzzed
Hangin' in the club, with my nephew Eminem
 Whattup cu'? 
The Great White American Hope, done hooked up
With the King of the motherfuckin' West coast, bay-bay!

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

I'm the head nigga in charge, I'm watchin' you move
You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it, cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin' over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the body bag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust?  They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin' with Puff
Bitch, please, you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

Aw naw, big slim dog
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up, in the, heezy bay-bay
He's Shday!
He's so crazy!
Gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal, makin' a living
Off of the world's misery, what in the world gives me the right
To say what I like, and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at moms, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on T-V
Or heard the C-D usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you fagot
You happy now?
Look here
I start some trouble everywhere that I go 
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know 
I start some shit they throw me out the back do' 
Come back and shoot the club up with a four-four 

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's, the devil, they always wanna dance

2001 and forever
Slim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, Nate Dogg
Come on, yeah!

Sneakin in through the back door, fruity MC's get ambushed 
Rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed 
Then I'm movin on down from the right to left 
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death 
To get jacked, attacked and cracked in two 
Smackin through 'til youre black and blue for actin true 
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands 
Proof that I be sniffin on aerosol cans 
I'm stompin, I'm kickin, I'm chokin, I'm stampin em 
clompin em, stickin, and pokin and clampin em 
To electric chairs and tightenin bolts 
Hit em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts 
I'm zappin, rappers, singers, and dancers 
Faster than you could snap your figures for ransom 
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathin 
Survivin by connivin and theivin 

 - "Do it!", "Eat em up" 

 

I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters 
It felt like I was bein attacked by spiders 
Developin a fear of biterphobia 
I'm holdin a gas can and lighter over ya 
If I detect ya, I'ma pulverize 
Dissect your brain, diggin in your skull for lies 
And I'ma torture, with material iller 
than a stark ravin mad serial killer 
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is 
A major risk to a plagiarist 
So beware of the aura, A terror for the horrible 
Will scare ya tomorrow, is the airbourne assault of the rappers 
Hit the source to better my skills, 
I head for the border 
And run the Galloping Hills, the choice is yours 
Cause now buddy's noises force me to scream til my voice is hoarse 
Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap that grab at yours and savage yours to bite like labradors 
In the range of my double-barrel 
And your life is in danger, trouble, and peril 

 

 

I trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires 
Cuz vampires right on my balls and clamp pliers 
And swing on my big thingamajig 
So I'm bringin my nig Proof for backup when I sing at my gig 
Cause biters are fallin head over heels 
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels 
That's how I became paranoid 
Chewin my fingernails, pullin my hair annoyed 
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate 
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with 
an ultimatum I assault and slayed em 
with rhymes and it's ultimatum just to cultivate em 
Energetic and imaginative, 
pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives 
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10 
That's why I'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen 

"Scalpel"
"Here"
"Sponge"
"Here"
"Wait he's convulsing!" "Ah"
"He's convulsing!"
"Oh my" "We're gonna have to shock him!"
"Oh my God!" "We're gonna have to shock him!"
"Oh my God!"

These are the results of a thousand electric volts,
A neck with bolts "Nurse we're losing him, check the pulse!"
A kid who refused to respect adults,
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose.
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery,
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me.
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack.
My first day in junior high, this kid said,
"Just you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"
I looked at my watch it was one twenty,
"I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?"
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first.
Something told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works"
I screamed, "Ow! My appendix feel like they could burst!
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!"
"What's the matter?" "I don't know, my leg, it hurts!"
"Leg?! I thought you said it was your tummy?"
"Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!"
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over.
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework."
"But don't you want to give me after school detention?"
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'm a let him"

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

Way before my baby daughter Hailey,
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey.
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes,
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers.
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin',
And had me in the position to beat me into submission.
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose,
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat.
I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beef"
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe.
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honky!"
The principal walked in and started helping him stomp me.
I made them think they beat me to death,
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left.
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth.
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws.
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools.
"This is for every time you took my orange juice,
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.
I'm gettin' you back bully! Now once and for good.
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could,
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood.
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot.
Made it home later that same day.
Started reading the comics, and suddenly everything became gray.
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read.
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed.
My mother started screamin', "What are you on, drugs??
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!" 
She beat me over the head with the remote control,
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull.
I picked it up and screamed, "Look bitch, what have you done?"
"Oh my God, I'm sorry son" "Shut up you cunt!"
I said, "Fuck it!" took it and stuck it back up in my head,
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck.

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs, what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

It' brain damage, I got brain damage
It's brain damage,
It's probably brain damage.

Eminem Has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper, Eminem
Who can say for sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society will reap a great benefit

I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of tourettes
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches
With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's despicable
I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freaking wuss, a pussy
This kid just took my stick of licorice
And threw my sticker books in a pricker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book, now there's using your head

Mama always said 'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous' 
Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus

I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless

Fast forward some years later
A teenager, this is a fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud gee for what reason, you stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, be down and be upbeat
When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life
Chance To make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street
But if I had just kept my head up my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicing trash talking in a trance
Locked in my room yeah but I got some plans mama
These damn rhymes are falling
Out of my pants pocket I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more, school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
Threw my first punch, end of story
Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void
Been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword
Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
Cause I'd probably be Dahmer cause mama always said

'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous' 
Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus

I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless

Now my mum goes 'womp womp womp'
Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top

I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go, they scream out 'Go'
I'm bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out
Middle America, hear them yell out
In terror they were so scared, and those kids
Just about, belted out
Whatever spout that it fell out
Of my smartaleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Motherfuckin' difficult, ch'yea, til then
Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
Til emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius
Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You motherfuckin' Insert insult here
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little lone MC would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it
And boy they did flock
Can't believe this little hick locked
This hip hop shit in his pocket and still the shit got
That white trash traffic and gridlock
Shit happened like a six blocks from a Kid Rock
Insane Clown Posse Concert in mid Oc-tober
And got forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog
Cause I turn into the unabomber mama always said

'If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain you'd be dangerous' 
Mama, Ima grow a name and be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus

I'mma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Mama always said 'Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
Guess it pays to be brainless

Insaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't

It fits perfect

Better watch out sucka now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught comin' and I'm packin' in my lunch a
Buncha missle launchers 'n a buncha contra
Ban-van full of ganja, now come on ja-
Man stop! Man said, "Marshall, Oh-my-God, ya
Doin the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quad-ra-
Polegic, boogyin' down to Frank Sinatra."
Lindsey to the Lohan, naked while you let me watch ya?
Who'd a knew the pew'd a do to me what it's done?
Such sin-a-sism when it isn't in my system.
Blunt-igmatism betta spliff up to my lips son,
So much on my hands, I gotta give my kids a fist-bump.
Christo-pher Reeves swimmin' in my swim trunks,
"Mista, help me"'s what he said to me, and then sunk.
Women, skinnin' them and cuttin' them up in chunks,
In clumps, the woman with cocoa-butter skin once.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Always, you can see him lurkin' in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawlspace.
How the hell did he fit, em all into such a small place?
Hide em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?
Well fuck it then, I've got nothin' but time- I'll wait.
Until it dries, for the moment I guess you're all safe.
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's outta gas, my regular saw ain't.
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumblin',
You can even hear the evil spirits comin' from within.
Someone's in the back of my damn house rummagin',
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want her skin.
Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you tryin' to fight? You will never win.
Severin' legs, arms, damn there goes another limb.
Pull the lever then, trap door, death is evident.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Now, what ya know about Buffalo Bill?
Nothin', so chill.
Fuckin' hoe, ya better fuckin' hold still.
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill.
Cut em, gut 'em 'n just get to stuffin' those girls.
Man,I think she had enough of those pills,
So take that thing away to come back later, just to clutch in those steel
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal,
I hate the loud noises, I fuckin' told you!
I keep hearin' voices, like "Wouldn't ya like to go an get your butcher knife,
And push it right through her, while ya put your shish-kebab skewers
Into her barbaquer? Would ya do to her
What ya usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?"
"In a world of sin-doer, this is turnin' into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornaments you are."
I'll be sure to Gin-sue ya til there's no more skin to ya.
Boo-ya, who ya think your fuckin' with?
Duck, because here he comes again.

Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up in those kilts,
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts.
Man, you don't want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills.
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging

I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punkass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect
That's what he says to himself
As he uses magazin his es to trash me
As he sits with both feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself in a rage
And it's destroying him slowly
Cuz he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

You aint no motherfucking 
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking 
I won't allow it, aint gon' cower to no 
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a 
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a 

And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall

Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers that just are
They just keep pounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja 
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Sug has Irv's on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they gon' huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks
So you ain't taking out shit
An dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card
And it backfires in your face hard
Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus the stylist you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch

You must be taking to much 

Now what bothers me the most
About hip-hop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugs, Snake Tongue, and Freaky Ta
It's like a never-ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
I'm not excluding myself
Cuz I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

Irvine, get your boy up off that 

Get at me, dawg
Holla

Yeah... Shady
Haha 
50 Cent... GgGgG G Unit
Haha 
Yeah Uh huh 

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire 'cause shady said so... I'm On Fire

Here we go now 
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone

But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12

Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and

Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line

But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX 
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael ?

Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group

Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to 
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya

Killin' you faster 
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it 
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it

But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog

How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow

Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be 

I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk I'm still the m.c
You don't want to bump heads with me

You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja, you... stuart little, shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol

I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through yo hat so seven in 3 eights 
Erv you ain't shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe

Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with segal

Yo fuck that I'm tired of these -
Industry niggas  you get out of hand
I'm gone find you whereabouts 
We kill in new york even in Compton they understand

I'm on the block where you was raised 
They see me poppin' more ice because I could 
You probably forgot your way around the hood, good
Least when your paranoid its hard to make a song

How you want it with us and laugh  got make up on
Every magazine I open you on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' bout what pain is sucker
I put put your ass in the ground like a train conductor motherfucker

Yeah Nigger
Shady Aftermath
G Unit
Fuck you think they call us G Unit for

'Cause we move units
Uh Huh
And don't think we ain't billin' you for this motherfuckin' studio time
Matter fact keep em on 50
We call it even. Ha

Slim Shady
Slim Shady
Slim Shady
Slim Shady

Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
And punch a bitch in the nose, til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches
Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets
Call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin' through the airport, sluggish, walkin' on crutches
Hit a fuckin'  in her  with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out
Lookin' for some other thug, to beat the crap out
I'm bringin' you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate in English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speakin' so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

 Won't you busa rhyme for me boy...Slim Shady
 Yeah
 Won't you busa rhyme for me boy...Slim motherfuckin' Shady
 Yeah
 Won't you busa rhyme for me boy...Slim Shady
 Yeah
 Won't you busa rhyme for me boy... 

I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically 
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of earl, head twirls every time the toilet swirls *flush*
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up 
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse
To give you insults wrote with a pencil 
And waste the paper on you, choppin' down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'
You motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nuttin'

 Won't you busa rhyme for me boy...Slim Shady
 What's the deal?
 Won't you busa rhyme for me boy...Slim motherfuckin' Shady
 Yeah...who?
 Won't you busa rhyme for me boy...Slim Shady
 What's the deal?
 Won't you busa rhyme for me boy... 

Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily
What you want what you got is it hot? 

Turn the music up, we gon' wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gon' roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily
What you want  what you want  ahh uhh yo

"A person from another planet might disagree with you"
"Well if you want my opinion, it comes from right here on Earth"

Slim Shady...Misdemeanor...
Timbaland...Slim Shady...
Misdemeanor...

I'm homicidal, and suicidal with no friends
Holdin' a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' tecs at you until you see your fuckin' legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you
 Fuckin' mad dog, foamin' at the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house, is foamin' at the couch
Jumped out of the ninety third floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground 
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin' again
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire

Why'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy!!! Get back
Uhh, I'ma put you all in the line
Uhh, and I'ma watch you MC's die
Yo mommy, mommy, Missy done lost her mind!
I think somebody done pissed her off this time!
Yo, I'ma have to bust you through your chest and
Uhh, you will have to clean up the mess 
It's rainin', rainin' and it's pourin' loud
Never fear, 'cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
Uhh, I hear the gats go cha-pow
Who shot me damnit? Bitch get down
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile 
Lay em on down, like they lived underground 
For the sound, that me and, Timbaland, we found
Get your ass, kicked later, or get your ass, kicked now

Uhh...one-two
Misdemeanor, Slim Shady
Timbaland, motherfucker
Uhh uhh uhh
Cool, cool, cool

You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges 
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival

Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo Dre!
What up?
Can I get a hell yeah?

Showin' up
Chips on my shoulder
Knew about that cola
When I was in a stroller
Became a hauler
Choppin' them boulders
Gettin' older
Wantin' a rover
Duckin' them rollers
Meetin' quotas
Short and bipolar
Load up and c*** it
I told ya
One move in the wrong direction
Ain't no flexin'
And it's over
You want a doge a g
But you ain't a soldier
Chopper afford
You ain't Cobra Commander
You bolzer
I'm the composer
Writer of murder
The order
Leakin' out of
Your body temperature is gettin' colder
But you sweatin' like a person who ain't sober
Realizin' your life is comin' quickly to a closure
Losin' composure
Out of breath like you underwater
Twenty seconds in the game
And it's the fourth quarter
Primetime Dateline
The best exposure
Now you still on the news
And everybody knows ya
Yeah

By my side
To all them n****s tryin' to get me
It's by my side
I'm takin' some of y'all with me
It's by my side
I'm makin' sure they don't forget me
It's by my side
By my side
To all them n****s tryin' to get me
It's by my side
I'm takin' some of y'all with me
It's by my side
I'm makin' sure they don't forget me
It's by my side
Juh juh juh yeah

Go on boy
Get yo' vest
Protect your neck
Kill for fun
Watch how they run and scatter
When I go and pull out my gun
Call me ignorant and young
Psycho sicko negro
They know that I just f***in' be gone
Drivin' crazy halfway dumb
Don't stop even when the law come
Believe every word out my lung
I'm losin' it
Snappin' huh
This ain't just no rappin' huh
Back all the way
Back when you see that strap
Cause it go duh duh duh da da
Are you ready to die
Tell me why you choose to tempt me
Am I
Face have your body drop
Pack that five
Look at my eye
Have your spirit below me
I'm floatin' in the f***in' sky
All black is my attire
Lookin' like an umpire
Toss you in the trash
Like a bulls*** album fly
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

The murder capitol moment
Yeah it's thrilla
Put four in ya head
Have you floatin' off in a river
It's cold you shook
We crooks
Your body'll quiver
These rappers are tough
But really they softer than pillows
Or chinchilla
Get filled up
For realla
They turn into serial a**a**ins for some scrilla
Not me 'cause see I mean him yes this n****
Stays true to what I do
Cause I keeps it realla
Be for real
Have you ever ever pulled a trigger
It's serious business
Y'all
There's nothin' that's more illa
No discrimination
You can be chocolate or vanilla
Can find yourself in the presence of a f***in' killa

It's the Re-Up

Uncle Marshall!
Will you tell us a bedtime story?
Here we go...

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a massage, he's gay! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey!  

Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" 
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 

 Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice  Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
 Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him!  Stomp him!  
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again 
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 

Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

So this is it
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert

I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no where for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it

Every CD critics gave it a three, then three
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorce, re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I got a letter from a fan, that said
He's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you at least

A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter, you'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
 I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever 
 this is your song

You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously assuming you will be
Just thinking ahead, I'ma make it if it kills me
Let's see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion 
Sorry for sloppy writing, the pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write them
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter, maybe they can feel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to Mom and Dad's crazy world
Love, Daddy, maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup

I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter, you'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
 I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever 
 this is your song

You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into them, baby, I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering, I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping that you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter, you'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
 I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever 
 this is your song

Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
As a goodbye note, 'cause your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go
I'm getting sleepy, love, Dad, shit, I don't know

Yo,
If I could start from scratch, I'd change most of it,
If u gave me your trust, I wouldn't of broken it,
I shoulda helped you out, back in 97',
Shit I wouldn't of let u go I woulda made your life heaven
I woulda hushed my mouth, gave my shit up, 
I woulda minded my own business, n not let things get fucked,
Up, I woulda gone to church, maybe become a saint,
Erased this so-called picture we paint, 
I woulda bin a soldier, no matter what shit
I woulda bin perfect, the man u want-ed
I never woulda slacked, now this is a fact
I never woulda rhymed, ova this track
If u didn't want it, I never woulda rapped,
But this is my life n we can't change that
I woulda bin there, I never woulda tried
I would never want to live, I never woulda lied
I woulda changed it all back, to the past you see,
I never woulda let you put your fingers on me
I woulda let you be, keep my hands off the gun,
I never woulda changed, never try for number 1
I would never of intervened, just you n your son,
N now I'm revelating, putting it all into a song
I would never of invited you to any show I did,
I wouldn't of wanted you to show, even though you did
I would never shed a tear for a girl I can't stand, 
I never woulda back-talked, never raised a hand
I would never want you to think, that this shit was planned,
I woulda let you go, but I didn't think you'd understand
That we could never be together, I could never be your man,
But if I could turn back time I wouldn't put you through this again
I never woulda thought, that we could be buddies,
I never woulda asked for any pennies of your money
But its just the way you were, you were so cunning,
That's why I couldn't be your man, n you couldn't be my honey
Now I gotta start from scratch, change my whole past,
I'd change it all, make sure I never asked,
You out on a date cuz if I knew it would never last
I woulda forgotten all about you n erased you from the cast
I don't make shit up, I speak truth if I'm rapping
But if I could go back in time, 'us' never woulda happened

 x2 

baby im sorry
it all ended in a hurry
I didn't wanna cause no worries
but now i gotta leave..

Yo yo ayo

I'm fed up wid bein rejected
Detected, by your radar
You heard me and you ejected the tape
No theres no escape
I can't believe there's no-one here to see my true self, all they remember of me is rape
I try, I fail, I sigh I lie in my bedroom waitin for another world, I sleep, I die
In a dream waitin for you to come and sweep me away
It'll never come, its like I'm dreamin on hennesay.
I'm waitin for the girl that likes me for who I am
And looks past the shit in my life full barrier like a dam
This ain't no piss take
Words be spillin like a lake
And I wouldn't give to shits if u diss this like I'm a fake
I'm waitin for my eyes to awake, cuz I've just excepted this reality
And there is a reason why a lot of people are still mad at me
From year 5, year, 6 it ended at year 7
My trouble years, this is true like the destruction of 9/11
I went down the wrong path girl but I promise
If u take me in now, I wont make a mistake 
Or be a misogynist.

You are now listening to the sounds of...Shady and...Alchemist..Alchemist..Alchemist...

Got an axe in the duffel bag, couple of fags,
Stuffed in the backseat, muzzled n gagged,
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians ahh,
Couple hustler mags, now grab the pez dispenser,
Fill it up to the max, with muscle relaxers,
The governor of Alaska, She lusts when I ask her,
To shove my polaski sausage up in her ass huh,
While we hover over Nebraska,
Shooting at the fucking buffalo pasture,
In the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster,
She's screaming grab my titties, shady suck on those bastards,
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after,
I'm a gigolo, But Ya'll look like the juggalo rapper,
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper,
Shit, Back down,
Man I'd rather lick on a scrotum,
And eat the fucking octa Mom's pussy lips with some okra,
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg, Sizzle with Oprah,
While bossy pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa,
Getting home and play dick swords with the Jonas...Brothers,
Your mother fucking mothers are roamers, Like no other,
I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's...

Its chemical warfare, Drop bombs like sadam,
I'm bringing the drama, Like Barrack Obama,
Playing rock em' sock em' robots with the Octo Mama,
I'm vato loco, homie I'll cock those llamas,

Instinctive nature to bring the anguish 
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary 
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out 
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go'hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

Yeah, uh , and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place  like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
 Like a real thin joint it
 Comes on Quilted Northern
 In a built-in toilet
 Bitch, I told you I'm a dog 
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails
Should write a children's storybook 
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
 Off the feel of going in
 Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two 
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause

I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah 

You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash 
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan 
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
 Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like

Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

2 Chainz!
Yeah, yeah

Take 'em to church, I'm talkin' the tabernacle
It's the return of the body snatcher
Walk in the spot, make my woman smack ya 
In a fruit fight, I aim at your Adam's Apple
Pull up in the candy car eatin' a candy bar
And my girl eatin' a candy apple
Yuh, I line their ass up, I aim at their Cruiser
All of these stones on my neck, uh
They must have looked at Medusa
Pockets Rasputia of course
I drove some rims to court
I fucked some twins before
I had a Benz before, this is the sin report
This is the murder murder, pass the burner, Em
Your money shorter than an acronym
Big body when I'm backin' in
Ladi-dadi, got a bunch of bodies
Niggas fakin', nigga, human traffickin' 
I'm on the Act again, this ain't a accident
King like Ak-ron
I run the trap again, you on the treadmill 
Never, Neverland shit came with a Ferris wheel 
Ferris day off, baby, AR in the same car
Most of y'all my sons, aww, look at little JR
F-12 same color Kate Moss
Ugh, I'm talkin' wrist in the pot
I'm talkin' this and you not
I'm talkin' bricks and you not
I'm talkin' straight up and down, nigga, like 6 o'clock
This is the equinox, this what the people want
Somebody at the door, I heard the speaker knock, uh

I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
These bitches got flavors
They all wanna smoke but ain't doin' no labor
But they shoppin' at Raleys, they stingin' like tasers
Act Hollywood like they play for the Lakers
They fly on the latest
Crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters
Pardon my neighbor, we eatin'
That chicken, lobster, potatoes
You must be sniffin' that yayo
If you don't think I'm that nigga
Swagger on 10 since a day old
It's a-okay though, whippin' up whip like it's mayo
Every track is a K.O., fuck nigga, K.O
Go off your head like I'm Ayo
Out of this world, talkin' NATO
It's 'cause of jail, don't be an A-hole
'Cause I got shooters that shoot when I say so 
Wanna be in my shoes, you ain't paid no dues
Real nigga, you ain't break no rules
High school, niggas ate yo food
Might dumb it down a little, but I ain't no fool
Niggas hate every day, B 
Shit is O.C. lately 
Gotta break 'em off with these Dre beats 
Or I might go crazy 
These niggas too goddamn lazy
Don't ever, ever, ever try to play me
Lil' shawty now comin' from BK
But I'm tryna come up like JAY-Z
Nothin' but love from my heart, I feel entitled to titles
Fuck it, man, I want the title, my mission is goin' viral

I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

Bin Laden with a pen, body it again
I begin slaughterin' your men, prolly shoulda been
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin
Like a Saudi in the Taliban plotting an event
In the lobby of the Intercontinental with an obvious intent
And I will not even relent up on a little
Like Osama with a bomb under the bin
And down the middle of the Pentagon
And hit a kindergartener with a rental, stop!
Back and forth, back and forth
Like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court
Rap mature! Why can't you be like Macklemore? 
Why you always gotta smack a whore?
It's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort
Something's gotta give, that's for sure
Yet you keep comin' back for more
Not as raw as I was, "'Walk on Water' sucks"
Bitch, suck my dick!
Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit 'fore you heard it
So you formed your verdict
While you sat with your arms crossed
Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs 
Nah, dog, y'all sayin' I lost it, your fuckin' marbles are gone
But nowadays, every flow, every cadence sounds the same
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace
But if I look strange and out of place
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why I write 'til the page is outta space
Yeah, from 7 Mile in Novara
To "How can I be down?", all of us tryna pile in the car 
We shot for the stars, yeah
'Cause we only got so much time in this world 
So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
If you think you're promised tomorrow 
Now I'm 'bout to fool again
This tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
A freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip
And I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick
If I was you I wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood I'm in
I'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed
Empty the lubricant and put super glue in it
How many fuckin' rappers did I go through?
Dispel doubt but you won't admit I smoked you
And was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
But am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now
And I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
But the only way I care is if I let myself down
But what the fuck have I awoke to?
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools
I know you still want me to ill out, don't you?
Hopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open
Fire on your whole camp with this spit I wrote you
So chill out, no, you
Hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you
Then I took a stand, went at Tan-Face and practically cut my mothafuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you
You just called my shit trash
Thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked
"Revival's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track
Or when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap
Where's your content at? What's with all the conscious rap?
P!nk, Beyonc' this and Kehlani that" 
I just added to the fuel in my rocket pack
'Til I'm ready to respond, then I'ma launch it at 'em
Idiotic from the fuckin' embryonic sac
To the bodybag, I'll be back
And when I am, I'll be at your fuckin' throat like'

Like Chloraseptic

Eminem-
Yeah ...
Definately definately definately dope...
Definately definately K-Mart
Yeah Yeah
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
hence if I should draw out a line any fences
if so to what extent, if any, should I go?
cause it's getting expensive 
being on the other side of the court room on the defensive
they say I cause extensive psycholgical nerve damage to the brain
when I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too god damn sensitive
it's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
and Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
and let's clear this up too I aint got no beef with him either
he used to be like a hero to me 
I even believe I had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader and Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like its my fault cause of the way that 
I stuck him off in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman I killed Super... Man
and how ironic that I'd be the bad guy kryptonite
the green chronic

Cause i aint got no legs 
or no brain
nice to meet you 
hi my name is...
i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is...
Rain Man

Now in the bible it says
thou shall now watch two lesbians in bed
have homosexual sex 
unless of course you were given the consent to join in
then of course it's intercourse and it bisexual sex
which isn't as bad as long as you show some remorse for your actions
either before, during, or after performing the act of that which 
is normally reffered to as such more commonly known phrases
that are more used by today kids
in a more derogatory way
but who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say
let ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre 
I got a question if i may 
is it gay to play putt putt golf with a friend 
and watch his butt butt when he tees off 
but but i aint done THAT
in football a quarterback yells out hut hut
while he reaches in another grown man's ass
grabs on his nuts, but just what if 
it was never meant, it was just an accident
but he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
his teeny, tiny, little, round hiney
and he didn't mean it but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
and I don't need to go into any more details
but what if he pictured it as a female's butt
is that gay? I just need to clear things up
til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...

Cause i aint got no legs 
or no brain
nice to meet you 
hi my name is...
i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is...
Rain Man

You find me offensive
I find you offensive...
shit this is the same verse, I just did this
when am I gonna come to my good senses?
probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
my spider senses telling me Spider-Man is nearby
and my plan is to get him next and open up a whoop ass canister
god damnit Dre where's the god damn beat  anyway
anyway I don't know how else to put it 
this is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy kryptonite, the green chronic
demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it, I got it
high-five Nick Lechey stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
and as she flew around the room like a balloon i'd
grab the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can 
and to my headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
with a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwhich
and I don't even gotta make no god damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shitttt

Cause i aint got no legs 
or no brain
nice to meet you 
hi my name is...
i forgot my name
my name was not to become what i became with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is...
Rain Man

Yeah,
You know technically
I'm not even supposed to be here right now
So fuck it
Might as well make the most of it

Yeah, ha ha,
Feels good, whoo
Guess I'm lucky
Some of us don't get second chance
But I ain't blowing this one
Nah man
Shit I feel like I can do anything now)

Who can catch lighting in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin' out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup 'em
Spin around to freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man

There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I've start to ball prick you better flea cause I get ticked
It's a rap I was down, when I was down I was kicked, I got up
I'm back to punch ya to the ground ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD that shit's in my trash
I'll be God damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so betcha I'll last
So keep winkin' and blowin' kisses cause your flirtin' with death
I'm destroyin' your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin' your rep
I catch a flow and get goin'
Or otherwise I'm just knowin' there's nothin' you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I'll shut your lane down, if you can spot the parked in at 2
Arsenic flower, lighter fluid, saliva what can you do
Go get your crew, hype you up, stand behind you like "woo"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how bout you
Now guess who 
Here's a clue 
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his Nike shoe
He's in your ass, he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too
Now, what's his name

Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella
Cinderella man
Cinderella man

If I had a time machine
I'd be
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Music is my time machine
So call me
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man

Fuck catchin' lighting, he struck it
Screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Rewound the future to the present
Pause don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man

Cinderella man send to fell Shady dey
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story, nor did he
Come to do the same, can't afford to be a label in this day and age
And at this stage in the game, mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say goodbye to the old H-I to the new case or I
Consider it his last hurray
The coupe de gras, raise 'em high, in the sky
Keep 'em up time to bring the place alive
Thanks for bein' patient I will make no more mistakes, shit my
Potatoes they call me the veggies on my plate can fly
My fillet is smokin' weed, get back if the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
By the skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
Now how fuckin' irritated are you, how much in your face am I
And there ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm a spittin' image I mirror it
When I stand near it,
Your pussy lyric I cunt hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? 
Here's a clue 
He came to the ball in his wife beater and lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's all up in your ass, he's in your psyche too
Now what's his name

Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella
Cinderella man
Cinderella man

If I had a time machine
I'd be
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Music is my time machine
So call me
Cinderella man

Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
there you go
Yeah
yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet 
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human
but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show"

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet 
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet 
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Got to have it,
Yeah I made it
I'm addicted

This is a beat with no words at first,it`s a blank painting
Exercising the mind,it`s brain strength training
Starts off something like shady`s an insane maniac
Yeah slim shady that`s a zany name aint it
Now all you need is an image to go with the name baby,
Wife beaters and white T-shirts
Hanes mainly,it`s a long shot but it`s possible
there is a lane maybe,
If not,he`s gonna have to come and change the whole game, aint he?
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it
He can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name feinting
Shady did it,he sold out the whole stadium
Joe schmo made it,he took his plain jane lady
And his baby Hailey out the trailer
But he aint trailing anymore,he`s ahead of the race
While maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he`s about to be raped by this game anally

Got to have it,
Yeah I made it
I`m addicted

You`re operating on all cylinders
Syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts
People are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are ice grillin' ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya
But you can't decipher why for the life of ya
It wasn't like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your wife again
She found vicodin in your pants last night again
Your disputes public
Nothing is private anymore
When your best friends say bye bye to him
What kind of apple you take a bite of slim

Fuck no, the way that it turned out 
Was nothing like the picture that I painted in my head
Sometimes a dream I make is more fun than to actually make it
The game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relation-ship
With another girl, this World is a fucking trip
As I slip in another world
Proceed, take another hit
Sniff til I fucking url
Tell em all to fucking sit and spin til they fucking twirl
Middle finger up again
Relapsing back in this game, oh well, fuck it then

Got to have it,
Yeah I made it
I`m addicted

'Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
So on the, biggest days, they came to see you spit your game
Ooh
It shouldn't be difficult, to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice, you remain
Fuck em' all, tell 'em all, eat shit, here we go again

So, god damn, is it that time again already?
Ha ha, you don't look too happy to see me
Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck y'all then

You can get the dick, just call me the ball sac, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch dog, fall back you mutts
Fuck you worms, you never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it a sick duck, I'm on my duck sick mommy
And my nuts, lick, gobble 'em up trick, yummy
Bitch you don't fucking think that I know that you suck dick dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny!
Shawty dance while I dis you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on, cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm sitting and pissing on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So buck the Buddha, light a bong
But take a look at Mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, c'mon

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fucking around motherfucker
I'll show you pussy footin', I'll kick a bitch in the cunt
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin', you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fucking hater push me
I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me
Call me a fagot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down 
 nah I can't god dammit
Rappers are land fill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you're fake, ah what the fuck, that hurt wait!
Ah what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long, til then I drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women
When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to dis me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don't know, I don't know what caused,
I don't know what caused me to be this way to be this way
I don't know, I don't know by I probably be this way til my dying day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold beat bangs, I don't need to say
I guess this is how you made me

Yo, mic check 
Testing one, two, um, twelve 
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed 
In Curt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead 
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob 
Bought Lauren Hill's tape so her kids could starve 
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so 
S*** I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat 
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe 
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs until my show 
I just remembered that I'm absent minded 
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it 
I freestylin' ever verse that I spit 
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my s*** 
I told the doc that I need a change in sickness 
I gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis 
Put my L-P on your Christmas wish list 
You want to get high, here b**** just sniff this 
Cum on everybody, get down tonight 
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again 
That's why I write songs where I die at the end 
'Cause I don't give a f***, like my middle finger was stuck 
And I was waving it at everybody screamin' "I suck" 
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd 
And yell out loud "All of y'all get the hell out now" 
F*** rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm Sorry 
I'm bored out of my gord 
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot the the floorboard of my Ford 
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard 
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket 
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet 
Fell like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage 
And if you ever see a video for this s*** 
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit 
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

Got b****es on my jock out in East Detroit 
'Cause they think I'm a motherf***in' Beastie Boy 
So I told 'um I was Mike D,"they was like, "Gee, I don't know he might be." 
I told um meet me at Kid Rocks next concert 
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster, peace out 
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out 'till I started bustin' 
Freestyles 
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick 
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick 
Made a couple of crank calls collect 
I want to make songs all the fellas dog 
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of 

So just remember when I bomb your set 
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset 
Cum on everybody get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

Good mornin
Haha, wake your mother fuckin arses up
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleepin on my roof bitch

For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped
Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That want to be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit 
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion 
Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin 
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit be	
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently 
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?

Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin

So up an sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on an

?? the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun
Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit, 
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin 
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin free when 
You ******* need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a botique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?

Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So up an sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on an

Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like 
'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk 
I mean these niggas squeeze on me 
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seein them ?? I emtpy out them ?? to fight you 
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!" 
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt 
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life

I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it 
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back 
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it 
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you comin

Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So up an sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on an

So fuck it, 
Mine as well make the most of it.

Ahh ah ah ah eh eh eh eh ehhh

Feels good, 
Whooo, 
Guess I'm lucky, 
Some of us don't get a second chance.
But I aint blowing this one.
Naw man, haha, 
Shit I feel like I can do anything now

Who can catch lightning in the bottle, 
Set fire to water, 
Commin out the nozzle on the fire hose, 
Quiet and?

Cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man.

Smash an hour glass, 
Grab the sand, 
Take his hands an cuff em, 
Spin around to freeze the clock, 
Take the hands of time an cuff em.

There's a storm commin that the weather man couldn't predict, 
I start the ball prick you better flee cuz I get ticked
It's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up
I'm bout to punch ya to the ground, ya trick, 
It's a trap, 
Fuck my last cd this shits in my trash, 
I be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass, 
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last.
You can die in the blink of an eye, 
So batchin ya eyelashes, and keep winking and blown kisses
Cuz your flirting with death
I'm destroying your livelihood, I aint just hurting your rep, 
I catch a flow and get goin, 
No remorse, I'm showinn they slowin, for no one, 
Knowin there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin on the target like a marksman, 
The target is you, 
I shut ya lane down, 
Took ya spot, parked in it too, 
Watchin it flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can ya do, 
Go get ya crew to hype ya up stand behind you like whoooo! 
That boys hot enough to melt hell burn satan too, 
Fry his ass, and put his asses back together with glue, 
See you can hate em, he don't blame you frankly he would too, 
This game could I'll afford to lose him, 
How bout you?

And sell the fame, 
Raise hell from hell he came, 
But didn't come to bore you with the cinderella story, 
Nor did he come to do the same, 
He can't afford to be a label in this day in age, 
And at this stage of the game
Mediocrity cannot be allowed to fly, 
So say bye, 
To the O H I, 
To the new case of rock
Consider it as last of rod, 
Coop degraw
Raise em high in the sky, 
Keep em up
Time to bring the place alive, 
Thanks for bein patient
I will make no more mistakes, 
Shit my potatoes baked, 
Homie the veggies on my plate can fly, 
My filet is smoking weed, 
Get back if the steaks are high, 
Shit I aint even suppose to be here
By the grace of god, 
The skin on my teeth
And the hair on my nuts
I skated by, 
Now y'all are on thin ice
With anchor weights I hate to lie, 
How fuckin irritated are you, 
How much in ya face am I, 
It aint shit you could do beferret, 
Prove us here in spirit

Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyrics,

Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting fo
In this corner, weighing a hundred and seventy five pounds
With a record of seventeen rapes, four hundred assaults, and four murders
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world
Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

OK, let's go

Back with Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us. It's ridiculous you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit
Gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm the bomb the don I'm King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the Shaun Dawn burn marijuana do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
Fat ass burgundy bags classy shit Jimmy Choo shoes
I say move a bitch move

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk

Tell myself that I was doin' all right
There's nothin' left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you

Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
Can't you see what you do to me baby,
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat the next I want to sex
You make me crazy
The way we act like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jack rabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us
We can't figure out if it's lust
Or it's love, which that is attractin' us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today but you deserved it
You hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire
It's baby, because you stay with me
Maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you
I can see an angel in your eyes but if I look deeper inside
I see a freakish little side, like a devil in disguise
You're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators and dildos
You fuck yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool
Chill and you play your position you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business
You've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved
Maybe cause we're crazy in love

Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
You are the ink to my paper
What my pen is to my my pad
The moral, the very fiber
The whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being
The meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony
Is you rely on me as much
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel
I don't need you as much as I really need you
So you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me
You're the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me
I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall
You're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem
The Alana to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up
The beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half
The wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you oh

A lot of people ask me, stupid fuckin' questions
A lot of people think that, what I say on record
Or what I talk about on a record, that I actually do in real life
Or that I believe in it
Or if I say that, I want to kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it
Or that I believe in it
Well, shit, if you believe that
Then I'll kill you
You know why?

Cause I'm a criminal!
Criminal
You god damn right
I'm a criminal
Yeah, I'm a criminal

My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That will stab you in the head
Whether you're a fag or les'
Or the homo-sex, hermaph', or a trans'a'vest'
Pants or dress, hate fags? The answer's "yes"
Homophobic? Nah, you're just hetero phobic
Starin' at my jeans, watchin' my genitals bulgin' 
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum,
you'll never get hold of 'em
Hey, it's me, Versace
Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checkin' the mail
Get it?  checkin' the 'male'?
How many records you expectin' to sell
After your second L.P sends you directly to jail?
Come on! relax guy, I like gay men
Right, ken?  give me an amen 
Please lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
Preacher preacher, fifth grade teacher
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing 'cause
I watch t.v, and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new C-D for these fuckin' retards
Duh, and to think, it's just little ol' me
Mr. "Don't give a fuck," still won't leave

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme,
these people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme,
these people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

My mother did drugs, tar, liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out, disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal !
An animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd want to fuck me up for sayin' the word
My morals went, when the president got oral
Sex in his oval office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee
Now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blond-haired
And my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy, who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs
As long as it ain't happened to him
Slim shady, I'm as crazy as em-
Inem and Kim combined the maniac's in
Replacin' the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
 oh, that's Dre with an A.K to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you Dre, you should've kept that thing put away
I guess that will teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal
Aight look  just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfuckin' money and get the fuck up outta there

Aight
I'll be right here waitin' on you
Aight
Yo 'em
What?!
Don't kill nobody this time

Aw'right, god damn, fuck
How you doin'?
Hi, how can I help you?
Yeah I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fuckin' money in the bag bitch and I won't kill you!

What?  oh my god, don't kill me
I'm not gonna kill you bitch, quit lookin' around
Don't kill me, please don't kill me
I said I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you
Hurry the fuck up! {boom} thank you!
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it
I'll hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'm a be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme,
these people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal
Cause every time I write a rhyme,
these people think it's a crime
To tell em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal
But I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

Niggas didn't kill me
Now a niggas gon' get
Peel my cap back
I'm never at home
I'm somewhere
With my shaft restin' on a ho's tongue
Sippin' Don Perignon
While she's sippin' up them newborns
Yeah bet you hate the news holmes
You probably somewhere
Sittin' on the stoop huh
Sippin' on a brew
Plottin' to pop me later huh
When will a hater learn
I'm too great on a song
I push weight on the corner
Send weight to the coroner
When courage make 'em turn performer
I transform into Uma Thurman
A dude's virgin
Verses lettin' a perilous nigga
With no purpose
Continue to walk this earth's surface
I was birthed for hip-hop
Branch out my services
Ya try to murder this nigga
That's comin' from the same turf as ya
What nerves of yous
Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit
I'm gettin' rich, I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's
Dig? With a bitch
You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big
On another rapper's dick
Go on represent where you live
Know you annoyed
But don't make the mistake
I'm state to state in that Honda nigga
Not an Accord
I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford
And yup it's probably easy when a nigga is on board

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me
I'll lay his ass out and park a Grand Am on him
The city where the weak survive and the strong die
Where beef collide, shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy
I done seen the worst of the worst, and what can be worse
Than a verse about bullets dispersed up in your shirt
The streets is like a curse, niggas frontin' for a bitch
It's like you beggin to die like bear huntin with a switch
A part of my heart is gone, I can never smile the same
Trigger finger is itchy, it'll take a while to tame
Detroit is hella Dirty but the Dozen can fix it
Resist and a biscuit will excede the distance
And bounce off one's home, hit and ricochet
Off a kid's trombone right to where you niggas lay
Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away
I shed tears but you can get your fill of it today

Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now
Cryyyyy now

Laugh now, cry never, my Beretta is a body part
Hit 'em with just enough shots to make his body art
Now I feel like we even
See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas this evenin'
Soon as I get my call I'm right on them zeros I'm leavin'
Load up a clip and make it dark on them heroes I'm cheesin'
Shit they got snitches on the clock, gotta watch what I sayin'
Me buy a bitch a couple rocks in a watch? Quit playin'
Back on my grizzy my nizzy, nobody ran with me
And for them fuckin spectators I brought the band with me
Halftime niggas, and grab pine you would never grab mine nigga
The doc was lyin' when he said you gon' be fine nigga

Witness the art of war, in the physical
Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical
And no words from Ca$h mouth is fiction
Ready to throw clips if, I'm never dissin you
My aura awards raw to the core and the surface
Of the street, when I walk through the door, my purpose
Is to move up, pull tools you purp'in
Watch me overthrow the government for my interpret
Plot of Bin Laden, soul of Mumia
I'm prayin' to Proof, I'm Searching for Jerry Garcia
Talk to my brother, gone in the streets of the D
I'm totin' the K, and hawk niggas waitin on me
You take the first shot then, Second Round's on Me
And when you walk, on the other side of me, and my brother ride
I don't rap for the plaques
My contract's signed just for scratch to get you wacked
Nigga, with a gun, with a shank, with a bat
Take a slug through the lung, get it right, what you wack nigga
I'm born crazed deranged and more famous
Than clappin' down bangers meant, for entertainment, geah

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

Young Stat keep the gat on tuck
Want war, I don't give a fuck
Shot 'til you kiss, pucker up
It'll lift him up, believe me you'll float
The result is your family heartbroke
Lookin' like an artichoke vegetable, hold stiff
Nigga paralyzed from the neck down, my goons stick niggas
Turn soldiers to stick figures, hand on triggers
Real life, born killers, we roll out like four-wheelers
God shill us, from back-stabbers and goldiggers
Tipsy off brown liquor, watch me
Obnoxious, broads call me cocky
Poppy long dick Stat beat up the box like hockey
Especially when a bitch ride dick like jockeys
From the Benz, to the Range, to the black jalopy
I'm the shit, the only one who ain't heard is Foxy
Formalize the plan, no man can stop me
Boss hog, Stat Quo understand, you copy?

Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, cry now
Cryyyyy now, nigga cry now

Yo, mic check
Testing one, two, um, twelve
This is my dance song, can you hear me?
Alright, turn my headphones up
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
In Curt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauren Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it
I freestylin' ever verse that I spit
'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc that I need a change in sickness
I gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my L-P on your Christmas wish list
You want to get high, here bitch just sniff this
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was waving it at everybody screamin' "I suck"
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud "All of y'all get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm Sorry
I'm bored out of my gord
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot the the floorboard of my Ford
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
Fell like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'um I was Mike D,"they was like, "Gee, I don't know he might be."
I told um meet me at Kid Rocks next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster, peace out
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out 'till I started bustin'
Freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect
I wanna make songs on a fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of

So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset
Cum on everybody get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight
Cum on everybody, get down tonight

Curtains Up 
-----------------------------

Still on?
Yo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check
Alright, let's do it
Let's go, come on

Evil Deeds
-----------------------------

Lord please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Momma had a baby and it's head popped off

My momma don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off

Ring ring ring, on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch

But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn

Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt, uncle Edna 'n Charles

They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song

It went a little something like mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?

Predominantly, predominantly, everythings always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black
But what about me, where does that leave me
Well I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?
What do I look like some kind of idi-wait a minute, shit, don't answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit,
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these deamons
I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
This Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what it feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe see doe now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please god, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, myself is gone

Bad boy baby
Yeah, yeah
Junior M.A.F.I.A., yeah
Yeah, B.I.G. 2000
B.I.G. 2000 Born Again, c'mon

The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke, gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer, motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace, smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, capeesha? I'm out like, "The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin' the floor, and me hittin' the clit'
Suckin' on the tits! Had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was "Humpin' Around" and "Jump-in Around"
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man, she said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E 

The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong

When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC
G's disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Found your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feelin' it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin'
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong

You're dead wrong

There's several different levels to Devil worshippin' horse's heads
Human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals havin' sex with 'em, camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit, I just
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin', I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third
Then she's dead on the fourth, I'm dead wrong

The weak or the strong, who got it goin' on
You're dead wrong

As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Nighquil then I salivate
Start off with the Nighquil like I think I'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate
Too a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think with all I have at stake
Look at my daughters face
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Dorritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat

Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know

Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a f***in' year
And that f***er still talks to me he is all I can f***in' hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man I got half a mind
Too have another half of gla** of wine sound asinine
Ya I know
But I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncing ball
S*** must have knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow what the f*** happened last night where am I
Man f*** am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache
S*** half a Vicodin why can't I?
"All systems ready for take off please stand by"

Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,
But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know

So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh
A couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high
Now I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this s*** if Deshaun didn't die
Oh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new f*** it what would Elvis do in your shoes
Now here I am three months later full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from two homes relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day let's see
That's an Ambian each nap how many Valium, three
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken four years just too put out an album B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the Nomonia thing
It was bologna was it the Methadone ya think
Or the Hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your vcr tape cases with you Ambian CR great places to hide ain't it
So you can lie to Hailie I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor

Sometimes I feel so alone,
I just don't know, feels like I been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as I go home and close the door,
Kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place I do,

But I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't
And why I just don't know

Yo, alright, yo
I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit, I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
Door's open and close by themselves, books fly off shelves
Curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said
"Come follow me into the pits of Hell"
I heard 'em yell "Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!"
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother
Covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel
I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess
And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later
To see if I'm interested in being partners

Girl you gimme writers block
I'm at a loss for words
My minds as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no a** as large as yours, how much that cost?
That's what I call a awful splurge
You drive me bonkers I'm about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' until I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates, no lozenges or cough drops and 'certs
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, 'cause since then I can't be apart from her
'Cause nobodies body's awesomer, I lust it, and she loves me 'cause I'm popular, but

You know this ain't love
Oh no, no this ain't love
You know this ain't love
You know this ain't love  It's desperation

She's lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her

I can't even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her 

Well obviously, oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
'Til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
'Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery
'Cause now you see nothin' but me, and I don't see nothin' but you
And I'm about to flip 'cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips and we can't do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone, can't, specifically to describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin' bout 'I live and breathe you'
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically addicted to me
As Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you, don't wanna be with you neither, b****
Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek, 'cause this ain't

You know this ain't love
Oh no, no this ain't love
You know this ain't love
You know this ain't love  It's desperation

She's lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her

I can't even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her 

Just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else
What the f*** you whispering for? You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain't the same as mine,
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too, get the picture?
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? What? The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were using me for loot like I used you for looks
Hoe thought you was too good for me, huh? 'Til you choosed to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack,
But I can't stomach this I'm leavin' you, I'm not comin' back
She said 'The f*** with that
Where's my Louisville Slugger at?'
She grabbed that f***in' bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and that's technique
She came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, it would of put a hundred yard field goal, through the uprights

You know this ain't love
Oh no, no this ain't love
You know this ain't love
You know this ain't love  It's desperation

She's lookin' for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her

I can't even put up a fight, 'cause I give in at the sight of her  It's desperation

Fuck an intro man, let's go..
I come around like what goes around
what goes up must come down
anyone who comes up must go down
might as well go for the gusto now
better not let up better not let them breath
last shot give it all you got
try to turn me down bitch get fucked with the volume nob
fuck all you snobs
hoes I hope all you rot
2 bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought
and you wanna menage-a-trois you twats
fuck that I'd rather turn this club to a bar room brawl
get as rowdy as Roesthlisberger in a bathroom stall
like a leaf stuck in a vacuum you're only nothin but a whole lot of suckin'
goin' on in rap
yeah but I'm home
Bad to the bone
Back in the zone
Let him alone
You don't wanna go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that your on
crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen
in other words there's no heir to the throne
when I die so does hip hop
Hitchcock of this shit bitch ass, doc got it zip locked in a bag,
you fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top
keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone like I'm in the twilight
talking of my bone this is my mic dog I like hogging it
flow so wet I'ma take this beat tobogganing
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging it
pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
suplex it on cement like I'm on some straight outta Compton shit
take this dick and chomp on it
I'm so bad I can bitch slap a back-handed compliment
jackass eat a donkey dick
the game I just about conquered it like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit, I reign supreme in this honkey shit
no sense screaming and arguing
makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in
you think you ball well I palm it
I throw up bombs when I vomit
boy I throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omlette
but you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
bitch I'm as batshit as Ozzy it's obvious
you can tell I go right off the bat
no pun intended but come any closer I'll bite off your head
tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I catch a fly in that bitch you think you fly you just food
I give as much as a flying fuck as that Superman do
guess I just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and baboozled
confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too
but you better hope you can handle the heat
or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
I came to cock block like a square fuckin male chicken
yeah it's Shady slut the rest can suck on a big one
cos I'm despicable like Daffy Duck when I'm spitting,

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that 
I swear I love my city, I just want a little 
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that 
Detroit vs. Everybody

I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think its changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells
But not by the seashore if he gangbangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
This twin Eagle's of Ares coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
Real talk, I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
 Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
 Do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka

Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 Percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offence dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than 9 months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to,gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part 1, wait 'til the sequel

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that 
I swear I love my city, I just want a little 
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that 
Detroit vs. Everybody

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
'Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a sack on your head, you bleed out like the reverend
And to think our hood harder then I might break the door
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I kings bout that scuba but I ain't get to no betterin'
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Zan got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs them, Detroit vs Everybody yeah

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
 I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit, but Jesus
I can just see why people stop callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET 'cause if
I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch, 180 Degrees in here
Trying to wait for the cedar chips
Mcs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah
When it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit may even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?
And if they mention us

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that 
I swear I love my city, I just want a little 
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that 
Detroit vs. Everybody

What up doe
It's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us
Or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody!
Hey Em
Let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'
Detroit!
Okay

They ask me am I ok. They ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
or am I just a little snappy
and they genuinely care
Doody, most of my life its just been me and you there
and I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
yeah I say it now and you can't hear me
what the fuck good does that do me now
but somehow I know you're near me in presence
or I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
and dawg you'll never believe this
but Sharonda actually talks to me now
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
man how you touch so many lives and just leave us
they say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
if it's true how the fuck am I supposed to get over you
difficult as it sounds

Doody, that's what we call each other
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
we was always brothers
never thought about each others skin colors
til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
it was like 90 degrees I was catching a sun burn
tryna walk under the trees
just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning I just wanna get home
when I look over in his shirt is off
I'm like you gon fry and like
No I wont, I'm black stupid
black people they got melatonin
and their skin don't burn
meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt
like I'm on fire
and the entire time you're just laughing at me
and snapping at me with your shirt bastard
and I still have to get you back for that shit
and by the way them playboy rings
my mother stole from you
well I finally got em back shit
it must have been at least 16 years ago
well I put em in your casket
moving past it, it still ain't registered yet
but you can bet you're legacy they'll never forget
the motor city mo-town
hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
it don't stop there
yeah, as difficult as it sounds

and this might sound a little strange but I'ma tell it
i found that jacket that you left at my wedding
and I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
and hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
and as for me and D12 we feel like fuck rap
it feels like our general just fucking died in our lap
we shut off all our pages,
all our cell numbers is changed
our two-ways are in the trash
so some cats will have to find a new way
and I know the dreams will die with you today
but the truth is there all still here and you ain't
purple gang, you gotta press on
don't ever give up the dream dog
I got love for you all
and Doody, it's true you bought people together who never
woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
you were the peacemaker Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
but you hated confrontation
and truly hated the feuding
but you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
if it had to happen, it had to happen
believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to
throw them balls back on Dresden
from making cars to paintballing
to getting arrested
to sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
they tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
didn't show up for court
so we got off on a technicality, left sweating
me, you and what's-his-face
I forgot his fucking name
shame he even came to your funeral
he betrayed our team
and if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fucking face
and that's on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name
i let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
for you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot of 54
just before we were supposed to get in cars
to come and see you
it's more difficult as it sounds

Ay, yo.. ay,yo
This is motherfuckin.. Marshall

The motherfuckin drama king
The motherfuckin drama king.. dude
Ay yo I didn't say it like I mean it, hold on

Shady Records

Yeah, turn that thing up

My music is soothing but it's also been provin
That it can put you in the mood to jump out of your car while its movin
You've been waitin on this moment
My sermon is like a omen
I'm servin, I'm Erik Sermon
I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it, I quit
Here's my rhyme book, go 'head and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it
Rummage and find somethin you can use to jump someone and roll up bump it
I'm constantly coppin over you, squattin
Shit has gotten to the point where I ain't even writin no more, I'm just jottin
This is chicken scratch
Shit is sickenin I been kickin ass off of bullshit throwaway rhymes
I live for the love of rap, you crazy?
I've made beats for Jay-Z for free, page me
You need a beat? You Canibus? Then it's Dre's fee
You Kay Slay, the fee's waived
I stay beefin with J.D. til the day Dre two-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazin him
Oops, I put it out, I apologize now
It's too late, G
It's on tape and the tape leaked
Say what you say, motherfucker
Drama King Kay Slay, motherfucker

Ja sold his soul to sing, leave our witness team on the TV screen, chase the 
green

so I'm quick clappin' the toy, mash and destroy
Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit muthafucka

Doe ray me, you fly so high to die don't blame me
cause you lost or caused your spot
imma save him on the side of my crusade
Ja quit playin', knock it off you're not 2pac

Ja quit playin, knock it off you're not 2pac

and you can't replace the late Great One
and when you gone you only gon' be the late Fake One
nigga please, stick to the script before the guns stick to the clip
and Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch,
fuckin' old ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen
built up slap you like Grandma saw sensitive

is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
bitch-made-man, now how you gonna connect
with those short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
you niggas could scream hollerin' curse
go ahead respond and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse

Slim didn't send Proof to get into wankstas
he told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
what up Gotti and this little war you pushed on?
put your ear to the ground for stuckin' your Bridgestones
whats wrong? didn't think we strong with real niggas?
roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
it's real business, y'all ain't caught the concept
you talkin' nonsense to walk in conflicts
contacts was blown by Benzetta in The Source
threatin' at the boss you see me at your porch
now Irv got the nerv to try and serve on us,
but Detroit niggas urban and ain't scared of the bus

Yo, props to my nigga Bugz
punks like you get beat up
stomp on come just to smack him with the heater
this rap cookie monster gets jabbed in his tonsils with dicks
so much that he should be fixed with a vagina,
who's behind ya? Cadillac Pac
or the transvestite that dressed like a little kid fox?
the chest like a little wooden box?
when I press tight on the trigger on this glock
let's run on the little shit you got left to help you eat
your not Pac's soul, without laws we'll help you sleep
you got shot in your video tryin' to mock Pac
you Mockaveli, get your own idea

Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
fuckin punk, pussy, bitch, I'll fuck you up boy

Obie Trice, D12, G-Unit, 50 Cent, Hailie Jade! Hahaha

Daddy is Ja Rule taller than me?

No honey you guys are the same size

I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
To young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jello cause

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy

Shady Aftermath, nigga, G-Unit
Rap juggernauts of this shit, we taking over

 Pssh, man I need a lighter man
 Right here
 Yeahhh.. whassup Slim?
 What's crackin?
 Hit this shit
 Ssshhit I almost hit this motherfucker today
 Psh, is that right?
 What is it with motherfuckers thinkin that..
 {*SIGH*} because we're in the spotlight or whatever that..
 they can do or say whatever they want to us
 and that we won't retaliate
 Protect my motherfuckin self, by ANY
 MEANS, NECESSARY
 Right?

Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do

Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Bein underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate?  I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate
Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows
You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home
But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me 
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up
marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?
FUCK THAT, this the fuckin thanks I get
for tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch
Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down 
cause you seein more support than I'm seein my child
It's like..

.. everyday I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
without these cameras in our faces like animals
for your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up the avenue
and catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
and what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
whether it's unloaded full or an un-registered one
No bullet, you're so full of shit
this clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude
over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit
Don't tell me bout the show business shit
I know what this is, bitch

This ain't business, this is personal BITCH
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very FUCKED UP day, I'm needin this fit
Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the 5th
Yo Em it's time to get serious with it 
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost my niggaz, relax yo'self
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth
To my niggaz who never seen it I mean it when I holla
at the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin your channel, you played like a fuckin piano
Ridin slow through Cali like I'm ridin a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke, that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
and turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit

So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
a front door with twelve locks
and have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
and everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
and one in the chamber, gun in the waist
and one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place
tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not
gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?
And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys
in the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn
screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin n shit
Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
so my address ends up on the internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them
that if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters, blow it out of proportion
"Oh, now he's pullin guns on his fans
just for tryin to stand on his porch"
And I'm the bad guy, cause I don't answer my door like "Hey hi!
You guys wants some autographs?  Okay, form a straight line!"
Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle
and climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you..
.. it's just that I'm not behind the mic
I'm a person who's just like you

Morning, Marshall
Morning, Doc
So we're discharging you today; how are you feeling?
Anxious
Anxiety?
Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world, nervous
Nervous? Come on, Marshall, you're a big boy now, sounding like a bit of a baby
You can do this; you found a sponsor yet?
Um, not yet, I mean, but when I get back
Well, if you find one, you find one; if you don't, you don't
Well, yeah, I mean, I gotta start going to meetings first and
Wait, what?
Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings
And it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your schedule
We know you're a busy person
But I thought variety was the most important thing?
So what else are you thinking?
Um, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps
And, I mean, learning them, and start being able to apply them
Steps?
Yeah, steps
There's a lot of them, aren't there?
Well, twelve
Christ, I don't even know them all
Really?
Anything else?
Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like
What do I do if I find myself in a situation where
Maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?
Take a drink
What?
Take a drink and, you know, take the edge off
Take the edge off?
Man, if I ever take a drink, I already know what that's gonna lead me to
What, you mean these?
Man, what the fuck?
Marshall, what's the matter, darling?
Having some doubts already?
Marshall, you can't leave me
You'll never leave me, Marshall
We'll always be together, Marshall
Marshall? Marshall?
No, no, no, no, no
Oh, shit

She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

I'll poke you man I'm Riker's Island Pokemon
I got C.O.'s bringin me Filet Mingon
But now a nigga home looking frail in a drop
With a bitch shotgun that's inhaling the cock
I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got glocks in the lex so we ride behind cops
On broke days we used to put water in our cereal
Now we crossing borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montano, full body armor
Soning niggas like Alfredo in the Godfather
Two shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
In the A-are 15, Bentley or Six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children

I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up
I told you I'm a Drama Setter

Since Yayo is home, them A-are's is drawn
Obie's guerrilla-Unit, fuck affilia-tion
We are one, it is sensless, for you to prevent this
The 40, cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instant, another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperament
And we holding them K's that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged they throw him in cages
But now my nigga's loose, Our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from whom's pupils, baby blues
His short fuses, put your portrait on the news
Nigga them screws is loose when you fucking with them shady dudes

With you momma crying cause her only son is dying
She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

Got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here
And y'all rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back itchy fingers on the mac
Get scrilla off of crack, get fifty's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggas amp you money
Cause I got niggas in Queens that kill for pamper money
Move like Kaiser, Jayson Williams slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats
It's the rap tycoon, Tony you all know me
See me on MTV I'm a parole
I was out for 12 hours and went right back in
For three hots and 1 cot doin time in the pen

I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up
I told you I'm a Drama Setter
I'll be the first to set it homie, you can bet it just don't get in the way of my chedda
Man cause I'm a Drama Setter
I don't go looking for no trouble but somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With you momma crying cause her only son is dying
She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

Obie, yo
I'm sick
Damn, you straight dog?
Bitches
Gettin' sick

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I had a bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis
Denise from the cleaners
Fucked me good, you should of seen us
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable,
French role stylin', body like a Stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigga
Debatin' on to fuck, or do I wanna be a nigga
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits
Sippin' on that fine shit
I ain't use to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' ho's money, but that's anutha story
For surely ya pussy on toast, after we toast
her clothes fell like Bishop and Juice
The womb beata', clean pussy eata, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotta' than the hottest block, don't stop!
Response I got when I was knockin' it
Clocks steadin' tickin', kinky finga lickin'
Then carryin on, semin's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owna'
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighta' than conditions of us black folks
we in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut, then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here?
This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit
Fuck

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

Now I don't wanna hit no women when this chick's got it comin'
Someone betta' get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw 'er
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But what's she shovin' me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to goin' toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce
She's havin' another baby of the month and it's yours
And you found it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visitin'
Someone else and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan
Now the plot has thickend 'n worse
'Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace ha ha ha ha
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta call in you his office to say it
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
And when you see 'er, you're gonna bend 'er fuckin' neck back yo
'Cause you love 'er, you neva' would've expect that blow
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleanas
Bringin' me home diseases swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit this ho's a genius
She gee'd us

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

"I'm busy!"

Would be able to display table, manners

To make this beat rock like scanners
Make the fans just go bananas
Yo, get our planners
That means I'm nuts for the sluts who don't understand this
Yo my clan is
Yeah right, and y'all gon' stand there and act like you don't understand it
Like my name is Janet and my titty fell out an' I ain't plan it
Check, check this out
And if you're rockin with your necklace out, that's my breakfast now
I'mma snatch it, yo my style is rechid, you can't fetch it
No you can't stretch it
And yo, it doesn't really matter cause your name I can't even pronunciate
You're the sa-same type-a mo'fucker
To go and suckerpunch Dre at the Vibe Awards
But he right behin the boards the next day
So, kiss an ass
Or kiss a dick, lick a dick
Eat my ass
Whatever you wan' do, it's on you
Big Proof comin' through..

Yeah boy,
Better ring the alarm boy,
Dem know what's coming boy,
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh my God, fucking Bomboclat
I'm hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire,
Tie a whore up with barbed wire, nothing but a broad boy,
I'm the real deal, and char-broiler on the bonfire
And Bon Voyage bitch, I'm like Chef Boyar-dee in this bitch, 
Send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for ya, boy you think your Tom Sawyer,
Til I pull you out the fucking story book and stomp on ya,
Fucking fictional characters and fairytales,
Prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris Wheels,
But it ain't fiction its fact boy beware its real
Them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero's shield
Mr fly by the seat of his pants para-sail
Or hit the trampoline bounce and grab a pair of stilts,
And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada,
Like your fa-da fucking ya mada

Drop the bomb on 'em,
Please don't drop the bomb on me,
Shady please, please don't drop the bomb on me,
Drop the bomb on them,
I don't want no dog gone beef,
See ain't no reason to sic the dogs on me,
Drop the bomb on 'em,
Please don't drop the bomb on me,
Shady please, please don't drop the bomb on me,
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no dog gone beef,
See ain't no reason to set the dogs on me

Boy, I'm the real McCoy,
You little boys can't even fill voids,
Party's over kids, kill the noise,
Here come the killjoys,
Me and Dre steel alloys,
The rap crown royals,
That scalp cowboys
Now how that sound for ya
Yeah boy you know we about to put it down for ya,
So kick your shoes off,
Before you have a sound voyage,
And siyanara see ya fuckers tomorrow,
Get some R and R and marinate in some marinara,
And have a coke and a smile, don't make me open a jar,
Whip ass on ya, that's the last straw your hoping to draw,
Yeah you fresher than most boy, I'm just doper than all boy,
I'm that boy boy, them boys them no up to par
I just show up go up to the stage and blow up the spot,
There ain't no boy who can do what I do boy I'm a star,
Boy, I told you boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm DeShaun,
Holten in this Bitch, I'm the proof boy your a fraud,
I destroy you boy, fuck around and blow ya to Sod
Oh my God boy, you didn't go there, no you did not,
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy your da plot,
Your gettin' got whether you try to avoid it or not,
Apology not accepted boy, Detroit is a rock,
We get to beefing, ain't no telling at what point it will stop,
All I got to do is point to the spot,
When the bomb drops boy does it drop,
And when it does boy there's a problem

Boy don't jinx yourself,
Boy I'm Michael Spinks with the belt,
Stringer bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
I'm sick as hell boy,
You better run and tell someone else,
Bringin' hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy who done said it,
Who said he was better,
I bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater,
Back better than ever,
The cheddar shredder the grater, the beef grinder
I'll settle vendettas a little later,
Giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
By saying Shady was ghost, I ain't even close to the gate
You 'bout a foot in the grave, stay put and behave
I'm bout to turn this fucking place to Beirut in a day
So hey wouldn't you say I'm the shit,
Couldn't agree with you more if you were to say my fucking shit doesn't stink,
Shady fucking aftermath boy the ship doesn't sink it just floats in the fucking water
'Til we fill up the tank

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a n****
But soon for a n**** it be on, mu'f***a'
Cause all the bulls***, just made me strong, mu'f***a'

So I pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
B****, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth Motherf***er
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, Motherf***er
I'm gone
Motherf***er, I'm gone

Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on yo f***in' head, ha ha
B****, I'm a pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth Motherf***er
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, Motherf***er
I'm gone
Motherf***er, I'm gone 

It hurts, but I never show,
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream "f*** 'em all"

Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes, got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that f***in' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-F***ed this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
F*** this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these f***in' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your f***in' heads better nod
Or I'm a F*** around in this B**** and roast everybody!
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, B****, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible
Hulk, you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your f***in' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and lettuce and olives
I'll f***in'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head, yeah
B****, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your f***in' head
And I could die now, rebirth Motherf***er
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, Motherf***er
I'm gone
Motherf***er, I'm gone 

Ooh shit 
Guess what?
I ain't coming in yet
I'll come in in a minute
Ah-yo, this is my love song
It goes like this

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin'
You're beginning to think women are swimmin' in pink linen
Again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wildin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in the car and start it and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a forty-two car pile up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I could see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place, I'm outta place
I'm in in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

'Cause every time I go to try to leave 
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve 
I don't want to but I gotta stay 
These drugs really gotta hold on me 

'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no 
They won't let me ever let 'em go 
I'm a sucker all I gotta say 
Is drugs really gotta hold on me

In third grade all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubix cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game and every face looks the same
They got no name so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like "Yo what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs
Are probably gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one so let's enjoy
Let the X destroy your spinal chord,
So it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around lookin' like some windup dolls
Shit stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now I'm gonna try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave 
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve 
I don't want to but I gotta stay 
These drugs really gotta hold on me 

'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no 
They won't let me ever let 'em go 
I'm a sucker all I gotta say 
Is drugs really gotta hold on me

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all
Wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow your probably gonna want to do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight?
Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you want to
Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every morning
But you're young you got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't
I would've did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still gotta a lot of growin' up to do
I still gotta whole lot of throwin' up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be forty before I know it
With a forty on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grand kids on my lap
Babysitting for Hailey, while Hailey's out gettin' smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave 
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve 
I don't want to but I gotta stay 
These drugs really gotta hold on me 

'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no 
They won't let me ever let 'em go 
I'm a sucker all I gotta say 
Is drugs really gotta hold on me

'Cause every time I go to try to leave 
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve 
I don't want to but I gotta stay 
These drugs really gotta hold on me 

'Cause every time I try ta tell 'em no 
They won't let me ever let 'em go 
I'm a sucker all I gotta say 
Is drugs really gotta hold on me

Drugs really got a hold on me
Really got a hold on me
'Cause drugs really got a hold on me
They really got a hold on me

Oh, all around the World,
there's an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

Classical palms
battle my own demons
I need a glass of Patron
bad as I need a horn
stabbing my clavicle bone
I'm at it or prone
first time I seen a dessert eagle
I was letting the 44 buss
the 44 pop
first time you seen one, you was eating coco puffs
looking at Robocop
I'm not a man, I'm a logo, I'm sustain
in order to clean my things you need saline
I'm never referring to the solution
I'm talking about more like the mustang
vroom
get respect from the get-go, hello
set to the echo, psycho
pen got a mind of its own, gotta write my rhymes with a timer otherwise
I'll probably vibe out to a nine minute song
as the echo follows the Maserati
as the petrol swallows,
I'm a thousand bodies away from a skeleton
check your bible inside it, it will say this guys an elephant
I'm fly like I'm, killing the scene like I'm a villain with wings
I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep,
right now I'm living a dream
though we may be reckless
the ladies check us
they whisper Shady records
baby echo

Oh, all around the World,
there's an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

I can hear them calling, calling, calling, calling, calling
I eat rappers with the rhyme, consume 'em
the only fucking thing that you consume is time
I'm super human, my world is like a Rubiks cube
its too complex girl, you assuming, cupids looming
my mentality's caveman stupid woman
my life is Truman show, all I have is music hoe
I stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago
so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow
cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'ma lay here just spooning yo
oh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful
diabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle
rhyming to the call, to the  all the way down to my sock and the hair on my toe
learn how to sew, so shut my own booty hole
cause I ain't took no sh-t since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'ma set this bitch on fire
and this time I mean I'ma pour gasoline on some chick and light her
cause this time muthafuckers I'm put my whole God damn dick inside her
I a'int even put my tip in that hoe yet
I'ma go get TIP and try to rip it wider

Oh, all around the World,
there's an echo
as he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
they chase the noise
through the highs and through the lows
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
they will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo

All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement, haha
I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough that you shame me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows Dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brains all horny cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I outta just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it fake it
They get so mad, when I call them both fagots
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the wiener schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the shizer, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussy's queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling stop!

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fuckin'-A even got a bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Aye yo Paul, It's Em 
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing 
And I know that he's not 'thrilled' about the video 
What does he 'wanna be startin' somethin'?' 
Well I'll show him who's really 'bad' 
Paul, 'the way you make me feel' with these calls 
You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror' 
And tell him to 'beat it' because I 'won't stop till I get enough' 
Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video? 
Well he'll always be that Michael to me 
And it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white' 
Because I 'can't stop loving him' and I hate plastic surgeons 
And I hope they all fucking die! 
How do you like that? 
And I like him, I like him a lot 
I want to touch him but I can't 
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit 
Sorry 
Anyways, call me back 
I have this idea about how I want to end the show 
So, hit me when you get this message fucker 
Oh, and by the way 
No I don't have a new gun *click* ]

New shit!
Obie Trice 
Eminem..
Get familiar with it

Obie the person that came up intreverted
Cause the nervousness, that was souly the only verdict
It was worth it cause he changed, became so I observe it
Servin such of a purpose
If you know him earlier from his days its like a different version
So much hurtin and pain gave him game for certain
Thats why there's curtains in this murder if you get em worked up
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin tougher
Had enough of isolatin myself in the room
Writin poems and songs, doin the same at school
Now look what he became, a fool
Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and not obtain fame from you
Livin hard but still Jeweliard and God walks and ain't spent a day in a pew
Regardless of this, I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

I stimulate the brain, mimic emulate the saints
Send it keep on thinkin its a fuckin gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane brain is on Venus, suck Uranus
Label me a genius, if you ever seen us you would say
He may seem as though he's plain normal if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say so he's vague
So they mistake him for just bein crazed
You part ways, you're impressin in crusades
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him peace and thanks
And catch him flippin you off with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum tuckin his fuckin penis between his legs

This is Shade 45, you know how mothafuckin Sirius this shit is?
This shit is so motherfuckin Sirius..

Shady!
Aftermath
Ha ha, g-g-g-g, G-Unit!
Ha ha! 

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your ass up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi-platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight

When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk!
Get it crunk 
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
Jump 
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we're just goin' off, popular contentions
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
Washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So D-J take the needle and just drop it on the record, what?
We goin' have this motherfucker hoppin in a second 
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

50 Cent, c'mon!

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty hunnies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc  no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

Cause we came here to set this party off right

Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're comin' with me!

Bye bye!

Lord please forgive for what I do
For I know not what I've done.

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do,
I just never had the chance to ever meet You,
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be,
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Mama had a baby and its head popped off

But mama don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off

Ring, ring, ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors on their front porch

But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn

Til' someone finally took me in my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles

They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they'd gang up on me and sing this song

It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb,
Debbie had a Satan spawn Satan spawn
Mama why do they keep saying this I just don't understand understand
And by the way where's my dad?!

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Predominately, predominately, everything's always predominately
Predominately-white, predominately-black, well what about me?
Where does that leave me?
Well I guess that I'm between predominately both of em'
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'm a scream
While I'm projectile vomiting.
What do I look like a Comedian to you?
Do you think that I?m kidding?
What do I look like some kinda idiot?
Wait a minute shit, don?t answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit
It's such Bullshit it's tush mull bish
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in
And the dad that he never had,
And how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict
And his ex-wife how they go at it man
I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers
Claims he had it, I can't imagine it
That little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank
And take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it,
Shit if you only knew the half of it?

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons I never
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe
I don't wanna be Satans spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa-Clause why are you not coming this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been So perfect but life ain't a fairy tale.
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this Ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now do-si-do now curtains up the show must go on now
Ring-around-the-rosie the show's over you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me
This ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on this ain't what I chose to be
So please God give me the strength
To have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Ooh!
Last one baby
Lets Go
Detroit!

Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think I think the lines are starting to get blurry

I'm in a strange place
I feel like Mase when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
'Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face

I need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
'Cause that's where most of my anger is based

Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of wack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
I'm strapped for battles, suck a duck, crawl out the back, let's bar fight

Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air
And bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
You done called every woman a slut, but you forgetting Sarah Marshall
Oh my bad, slut
And next time I show up in court I'll be naked and square a lawsuit
Judge be like "That's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?"
Smart ass, you lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you au jus

'Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's on you"
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic Kmart chains panic
'Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
'Cause it works when they're reversed, motherfucker

And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming "fuck, shit, fuck"
Adult with a childish like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like "merits, fuck that"
I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like "tight lyrics, dreamy eyes"
But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish

And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
And the opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition, ha ha

Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies

This darkness comes in me 
Here it goes again 
If you chose my pen that ain't me it's my evil twin
He's just a friend who pops up now and again 
So don't blame me, blame him 
I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin

Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time

So who's left? Lady Gaga? Messed with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than struck with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3's
Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'
Bed-written and destined to never leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger
My suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by The Joker
Lorraine said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her

Fuck that shit, bitch
Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers
I'd ever left it to beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with the cleaver
Golly-wally I bet he registered Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definite lean
My destiny went on the steps, I met Deshaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes, but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em

They were sleeping, I made them stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip top form
Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming "fuck the police" like cop porn

Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin
Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who do you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for?
And as crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants to plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin 
Please come in, what was your name again?

Hi, faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I ain't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's just small up there
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
That I should call the looney police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish somebody finally admit me
Into a mental hospital with Britney

Oh, LMFAO, no way, ho
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony
Hey ho, hey ho
I sound like I'm trying to sing the chorus to fucking hip hop hooray
No, I'm hollering, you got bottom in like an a-hole
Eight and a base whether I'm fucking off that instead of your face, ho
Let your low hand raise, yo

Tango, what you think, ho?
Slow dancing in bowling
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What? You think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work

But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skiddish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'Cause we are the same, bitch

Ah ah ah ahhh 
I'm gonna fackin cum 
Fack fack faack,  
I am, I'm going to cum
I'm cumming

In Love I just wanna hold my baby high above
I want this hand in it's rightful glove
Have people saying god damn she's fine
Me responding with damn right she's mine
Even though your gone, I try and carry on
Its sad but it's true, me and you
Were through
But people still think they know us and they don't know shit
But i want you to know im sorry and i still love you britt
But now ive come to see, our destiny will never fit
And that's why now i look back being once lost then found
Its getting tougher with you not around
Your the only thing that got me to smile
I guess our love was a truthful denile
Sometimes i remenice at what we had
Not knowin i was causing my baby to be sad
I never once tried to cause you this pain
Its crazy how one person can make u go insane
Ill admit me and you we had our bad times
We fought, yea but people act like it's a fuckin crime
No couples perfect, everyone faces bullshit
All i ever tried was to show you i loved you britt
But it's sad cause the image i portray the pieces don't fit
All this time how could it be, my destiny will never be you and me
But i wish people could see, how much im so crazy
In love with you, it's true i wish it was still me and you
Doin what we use to do, i wish they really knew
And i wish theyd know I'd never let anything bad happend to you
I got your back to the fullest, baby nems one to stay truest
But times were tough, and shit got rough
Every other day same shit breakin up and we fought
But just know britt my rhymes are true
Britt please know I'll forever Love you
It just sucks cause there's a few out there that got Nems back
People always tellin me get your fuckin life on track
But in order to do that i need you back
And that's why you don't know what you got till it's gone
Im so sorry that our love was always off and on....

First verse, uh
I'm on 'til I'm on a island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette witcha asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so that basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s!
My '90s was like the Navy, you was like the Bradys
You still fly kites daily!

Catch me in my Mercedes
Bumpin' 'Ice, Ice Baby,' screamin' Shady 'til I die
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now before I get on a roll 
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin', try them trailer parks
Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back wit' a capital B wit' an exclamation mark, maybe
You should listen when I flip the linguistics
'Cause I'm gonna rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'Cause after I spit the bullets, I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics! So get this dick, I'ma live this

Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now

I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane 
I'm livin' life in the fast lane 
Royce

My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war wit' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says 'I'll let you take me
You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpses, Jack Kevorkian'
Go 'back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
My tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers
Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity

Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up  and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get, get down
He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit now
Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I s-st-stutter, motherfucker? Fuck them all, he's just
A whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight wit' 5'9' to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown
Shawty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it

And then after takin' that, I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say 'The whole rap game passed away' on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson' activator 
Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data
Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Homie, this sick, you can normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader 

Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator to this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You rollin' with a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you sayin'

Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now

I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane 
I'm livin' life in the fast lane 

 heerrehhh..

Another day, another hotel, the inside of it's nice though
Oh well, this is my life so as I go and try to close for the nights show
See how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business
Guess I'll never get some of this shit just always feels so weird
To this day cause all I ever did
Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
So please don't make me some type of hero
'Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way but will still have a field day
With some of the fucked up shit in the world and tell it to sucking a dick
'Cause I still make fun of a situation
Someone's in like a son of a bitch at anothers expense
I'm fuckin' relentless as fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to senses
Stuck on the fence on a balance beam if I seem unbalanced
It's challenging but my conscience allows me to think
The most foulish childish things without even blinking
Without even thinkin' about, all the stinkin'
Amounts of people that seem to be reachin' in the crowds
I'm scream in the palace, sold out this evening
But now it's, maybe down to sleeping
Is it really my soul to keep or
Have I sold it cheap is it greed
Do I take more than I need
When I joke of leavin'
But keep over achievin'
'Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even

It's a fine, fine line

So I notice how I paint myself
And through my hair when ordeals I'm so vain
I want my respect but ignore the
Butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
Till I, sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
'Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights, yeah
It's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah
'Cause I swear to Christ there are nights where I stay up at night
And say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears cause this ice layer
I skate on's a nice way of putting it but I like stands
Feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player
I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
From this house it's quite big, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, nice I made it
But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song, it's a cycle ain't it
Then I wonder why I'm still famous
I keep walkin' the line
This gold fish poke it's old
But especially when you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
'Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
Or you sold your soul

It's a fine, fine line

And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back, to me

I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a dime and, now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernatin'
Hate even going outside it
Sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit browse
I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimers
Long time since I shouted them out, bout time
'Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee, you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys, accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I been thinkin' 'bout the time when I slept on the floor at the outhouse
Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'm, I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I

It's a fine, fine line

Eminem: Shady, that's me
Mr. Eon: Iron Mic Trilogy
Erik Sermon: Back with the flyest material
Eminem: Sh-Sh-Shady, that that, that's me
Mr. Eon: Iron Mic Trilogy
Erik Sermon: Back with the funky beats

Mr. Eon:
Packin' this third eye vs. you, a cyclopse
They trade in their high tops for nice sized white rocks
Words in my right, they pass my left ear
It's solid decked out, write the books for next year
Bear this grenade you got stun like virgin
Who that cat splurgin' instead of rehearsin'?
Tough guy, DJ Travi your high rise
Lookin' more like Ronald then the fuckin' fry guys
Go on uptown, fucking se'oritas
In Taco Bell screaming, "Viva gorditas!"
Bring all your dogs, I give 'em rabies
They never had a chance, I might chew up all their babies 
Got Pope John Paul the Second prayin' to Satan
Have your vegan girlfriend cooking up bacon
I'm obituite with that shit that you hit
Smoke my spliff with ya 'cause mine a ?

Eminem:
My nine is limpin', ya six deep when I spray rounds
Hit you with 12 shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
The eight straight strays to a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher 
No pun intended, snapped out of your whip
And leave it unattended before I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
'Cause I can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it
Snap the airbag, hit the corner and park it
You cornered a market, I got her tied up in the chair and gag
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cave women, while I'm grave diggin' with Marilyn Mans

Mr. Eon:
If you got a bowl of hash, better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit

Eminem:
And if you're spittin' whack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'm gonna detach it

Mr. Eon:
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit

Eminem:
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in a knapsack and latched it

Mr. Eon:
Yo, yo, "Eon's whack now," how you dig that?
Couldn't get on my record if you were street rap
Get the greater rate with these rhymes I be totin'
Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem
I got stupid mucus from these loose lips
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak
To the point that you stand up on your feet, best retreat
Best go back in time and steal my whole seed
The quickening, did a briss at the christening
I'm exercisin', to uplifting the foot stage
This thing's the nicest, I keep tellin' you
What the fuck this guy on the corner been sellin' you?

Eminem:
I'm e-mailing you at the wrong website
Mispelling you, break you and put the fear of Hell in you
Escape Bellevue you, stuffed the nurse in a purse
Disperse like I added too many words in a verse
Slim Shady, a perverted version at birth
Driving off, leaving the murdered virgin at church
The first person who searchin' the Earth for the motherfucker
That pulled the plug when they should of alerted the surgeon first
You throwin' curves and hit with your own words
Leave me alone bitch, I get on my own nerves
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
I'm takin' off both shoes and stickin' each middle toe up 

Mr. Eon:
If y'all got a bowl of hash, better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit 

Eminem:
And if you're spittin' whack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'm gonna detach it

Mr. Eon:
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
Dollar signs flashin', I'ma take your last hit

Eminem:
I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in a hatch-back and latched it

Eminem:
Any disease out there, I'm willing to catch it
Slim Shady, all praises to the High and Mighty

Eminem: Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
Mr. Eon: Mr. Eon, illest rhyme dropper
Eminem Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
Mr. Eon: Mr. Eon, illest rhyme dropper
Eminem: Slim Shady, naughty rotten rhymer
Mr. Eon: Mr. Eon, illest rhyme dropper

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin'
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

OK, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

There they go, packing stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow
We can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne

Y'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all, if y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales" 
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said "I'm here to do sink repairs."
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's play pen, I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see

I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

I'd be a horrible mixtape DJ
I would be really fuckin bad
THIS IS MOTHERFUCKIN EMINEM!
Or just Eminem
Whatever you want to call me
And your listenin to the motherfuckin easy listenin sounds, or whatever
Clear your fuckin ear wax out
This is motherfuckin DJ Kay Slay
The Drama King and it goes a little somethin like this
Yo turn that click off, alright 

Look ..

My music is soothin but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump outta ya car while it's movin
You've been waitin on this moment, my sermon
Is like a omen, I'm servin, I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book go head and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage ya find somethin
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumpin
I'm constantly coppin over you, squatin, shit is gotten
To the point, where I'm ain't even writin no more I'm just jottin
This is chicken scratch
Shit is sickin, I've been kickin ass off bullshit, throw away rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap
You crazy? I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat
You Canibus? then it's Dre's beat
You Kay Slay? the fee's waived
I stay beefin with JD to the day Dre two-ways me
That it's ok to stop blazin him
Oops I put it out I apologize now is too late G
It's on tape and the tape leaked
"Say what you say" motherfucker
Drama King, Kay Slay motherfucker
We dictate these mixtapes motherfucker
Xzibit blaze this little gay midget cocksucker

We are.. Shaaade 45

I done figured this rap shit out
I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
And order the mask til they want a war, don't start a war
Shit not no more, we done scared em off, there are no more
Victims to stick I'm fixin to pick some and start shit
I'm outta pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets, shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat em to death, Benzino went deaf
There seems to just be no one left to bully
Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush?
Puss is bushy
Ain't shit goin on, shit I been gettin so bored lately
I'm thinkin of doin some shit to get you to go and hate me again
To tell the truth, I liked the shit better then
Shit I could spit better, I'm bout to kick this sick shit again, look
The game just isn't the same, it's changin
Shit Dre's quittin, Jay'z quittin, now it's just gangstas just sayin the same shit
It's ancient, it's fakin
It's makin me so bored, I'mma just make a new language
Fubba you cubba cubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
I'm not a human I'm a supersonic neurobonic suicidal unibomber
You think I'm a nuisce, I'm impressive I'm the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since Tupac moved to Cuba on us

Ha ha Yeah, yeah we back again
We doin our shit yo word up
I wanna hear some fly shit, you know some get high shit
Word up I wanna hear some white boy shit man
Yeah I wanna hear Eminem, man, talkin about all the shit he be doin

If you don't do fuckin drugs, fuck you
If you don't do ecstacy fuck you
If you don't pop mushrooms fuck you
If you aint on a tab of acid fuck you 

I'm nausous in this place I need some office space
The boss is late I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can almost feel his throat with no pulse when i choke him
In ten seconds I'm gonna turn into hulk hogan
With a cigerette in his mouth he tells me there's no smoking?!
I'm sick of this shit it's ridiculious 
All i picture is kickin his ASS
While he's takin his ASHES and FLICKIN em
I'm sick of his stamps I'm sick of lickin em
Sick of STICKEN em, I'm sick of looken at em
I'M SICK OF EM
Alright Mr. Mathers pick em up!
No YOU pick them up! Bitch stick em up!
Get against the wall senior citizens and all
I can't take this shit no more
Everybody hit the floor get the door
Close it and lock it put your wallets back in your pockets
I don't want dollars aint none of us walkin out of this office

Faggot, fuck you
Work at the post office fuck you 
Talkin shit to me tellin me to take out the goddamn garbage fuck you
If you're a fuckin dick fuck you
If you're a white rapper fuck you
Talk shit about stretch you're cool
But if you don't talk shit about Stretch fuck you 

If you're a fuckin punk fuck you
Talk shit about me fuck you
You wanna battle me fuck you
I don't have to say shit to you but FUCK YOU

"Fuck it, Friends or no friends I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the ends"

I shoulda been able to see that you were the one behind this
but i was blind as fuck to see that you were the kind that stuck some more in the spine this
It was another friendship broke in half
and watch you turn everything into a game and joke and laugh
and both of us know we can't discuss the situation
I just hold this confrontation just revolts
and accusations and insults
so I'm just let it go from that
we need to be I told you now, from that
what goes around comes back around
believe me, duck from that, come here you fuckin'

Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you fuckin backstabber
why i oughta, be the nigga that's up to no good, haha

"Fuck it, Friends or no friends I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the ends"

Take a second to stop and think about what you done
and you woulda thought that being a friend, Instead of what you won
All because of what you run your mouth
you wanna prance around and gloat?
Lets see how well you dance around
when i got my hands around your throat
Cause It's a matter of time till I get my blows in and it won't be long
You shouldn't go walkin around and stickin your nose in where it don't belong
Cause everytime you talked when you was stretchin the truth
There's gonna be more go flyin up but you gonna catch it in 2
come here, come here you fuckin'

Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you little backstabber
why i oughta, be the nigga that's up to no good, haha

"Fuck it, Friends or no friends I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the ends"

Come here you lil double-crossing goin behind my back snitchin
good for nothin but trouble causin instigating fact switcher
you were the least that i suspected
Until the puzzle well into place with every peice that I selected
But I'll never let that crap happen again
You come backstabbin' again
catch it smack dab in the chin
that's for backstabbin a friend
cause every name in the book
wouldn't be enough
so i just figured I'd say your name in the hook
check it out, come here you fuckin'.

Come here you fuckin backstabber
why I oughta, be the bitch nigga from the hood, haha
come here you little backstabber
why i oughta, be the nigga that's up to no good, haha

"Fuck it, Friends or no friends I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the ends"

Backstabbers don't live too long
Around my way friendships betrayed
In the hood you die for that!
For those that don't love this combat and verbally say this
This could relate to the death of a backstabber
That's like the desire to make social distant vibration combustion of the neck
The backstabber for the female, you sleezin ass bitch nigga!
So remember, the backstabber always loses in the end
A friend is a friend to the end
F-R-I for Fri, E-N-D a friend for the end'..yes
To eternity'..the backstabber shall never flourish
Take em out'.

Hi!
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphillis germs
and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it
 Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it

Chorus: 
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy

I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of thai weed
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
on if I keep on killin my girlfriends

Chorus:

Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
 I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be 
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"It's probably AIDS!" Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
and pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn

Gee wilikers Gatman they got me surrounded

I'm on my way

I got a gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

Robin, Cagney or Lacey, it's 50 cent and Shady
The worst baby, put your hands on my peoples
I'll react crazy, put a hole through ya front and ya back maybe
But dude if you try me, I'll have ya ass hooked up to an IV
I'll leave no witnesses when I ride, be
You fuck with me, you see
I'll react like an animal, I'll tear you apart
If the masterpiece was murder, I'd make shit art
Niggas knew I wasn't wrapped too tight from start
But bein' a little off, landed me on top of the charts
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
And my cock back hollow tip in the chamber
Will ain't ya, anger will change ya
And make ya aim there and squeeze

I got a gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

Motherfucker, you retarded you touch 50
I'll leave you dearly departed
We're walkin' away from a beef, in which clearly you started
I said we're walkin' away, did you hear me you want to be thankful
That we ain't beefin' was to agree and just leave it at "that"
That's when me, 50, and G-Unit hop back in that "bat" mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rappin', it's gonna be "Reh!"
Retaliation will be like that Muslim shi'ite "attack"
Some where along the line, its like me and 50 made a "pact"
He's got my back, I got his back, "back"
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other in
So we'll do shit like we're conjoined at the hip
Its just unavoidable some of this shit is washable
And some shit will never boil up
And some of it will just simmer at best
If left at home, we'll let it be so there won't be no sit downs
The days that Zino, there will no peace discussions with me
There ain't gon' be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin' with me and I'll gladly quit fuckin' with you
This bitch is sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentionin' me you're gonna sing ? to Jimmy Iovine and Dre and 50
D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be or we'll be back with a

I got a gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

Nigga you get it twisted, you can get ya wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hustle, I get money, in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme I'm plotting in the county and I'm with it
You cross me and you goin' make a cemetery visit
That's gangsta, you know me I told it, 'cause I live it
Showcases drop, when that chopper chop
Way up the block, get hit with copper tops
When drama pop, the llama pop
And it won't stop, you can run, call the cops
They say no, niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you I want it
Its not a game, perfect aim, you feel the flame
Up against ya brain, man its so hot I'll make ya wish it rained

I got a gatman
There's a problem I'ma solve it
A nigga movin' around
With a big ass revolver and a bat, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady I'll leave you dearly departed

Yo, yo! 
Mic check

Testing, one, two 
Ff-fuck
 My nuts

My attitude is worse than N-W-A's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and dis people 
Who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does 
You see me standin' outside of your buildin' screamin'

"Puffy is good,  but Slim Shady is for the children!" 
I look at my life in a new light, fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted 
Cause I don't like rap anyway

I'm just tryin to get my porno career started
Every place and event, "Been there, done that"
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went 
"Come on, let's go!"

Want a deal? 
Study these 5 chapters
Lesson one,
Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers

Lesson two
Face 'em and dis 'em 
Don't give em a demo, kidnap em 
And make em come to your basement and listen 

Lesson three,
Get a job at a label, switch demos with Canibus 
And put yours on the owner's table 

Lesson four 
Know you heard this before
"Hey let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!"
Don't act like a fan, you want to get signed?
Get the Withest A and R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson Five: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street, I ain't 
Givin' you shit bitch, don't even bother askin' me 
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin' like Master P 
Got a blow job from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones 
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah 
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea 
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin' Aaliyah
 I splish splash while I'm takin' a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash, fuckin' your wife in the ass 
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass

So if I hurt your self-esteem 
And you get dissed too bad 
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had 
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
"I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!"
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
"He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!" 
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee!  I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway  and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin' from it, rippin' your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh 
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with 'Agent Orange'
And wiped my ass with his page in Source 
The demon is here, steamin' this year
I rip  voice box out, scream in his ear 
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
"Yeah I don't think this guy is well" I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail

I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin'
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nut-sack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris-topher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beatin' your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleedin' in jeans
 Wakin' up the next day in breathin' machines
Flashin' back to being shot and repeatin' the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke

So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
"I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad"
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
"He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad"
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

I know that makes you real mad, don't it? 
That's right, Slim Shady  Sway & Tech
Sprayin' wreck 
And we don't give a heck 
Or a damn, or a fuck, or a shit
So suck my motherfuckin' dick

Ready or not here we come, here comes trouble in the club
11,12,13, pistols big as M 16's
How the fuck we sneak in with this many heaters in our jeans
Nina, 2 nina's, a peace and they don't even see us
Some shit pops off we squeeze each one they gon' think its machine guns
Vanos vo vano, bananas in our flannels
Hands around our colt handles, hold them like roman candles
Vannas vo vannas, banana fanna fo fannas
Who come back all bananas, banna clips loaded
Managers, bouncers and the club owners, the motherfuckers don't want us
To come up and rush in the club and run up in it with a bunch of
Motherfuckers from Runyan, steady popping them onions,
Ready set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixing to get into some shit just itching to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mixing coke with coke and nut rum up
Yeah Yeah oh, what up, see my people throw shit up
See you talk that hoe shit now when you down you don't get up
And can't sit up your so slit up, the ambulance won't sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up
Heater no heater, automatic no matic
Mac or no mac it don't matter if I have or don't have it
You never know what I'm packin' so you just don't want no static
And open up a whole can of whoop ass you don't wanna chance to
Risk it no biscuit, mili mac a mac milli
Really homie don't be silly, homie you don't know me really
You're just gonna make yourself dizzy wonderin what the dealy

And automatically explode on motherfuckers until they mouth be closed permanently

Tempt me if you think Swifty won't send a slug, people run,
When the reaper comes, the repercussions' gon' leak your blood,
Inglewood, steepin' without a weapon, you leave, you gone,
I'm still runnin' with stolen toasters while on parole,
Snatch you out our home, like eviction notices hoe,
When I unload, I'm known to never leave witnesses to roam,
When I'm blowed, I'll write the wicked in scroll,
At the toll, when I'm sober I'm prone to roll up and disconnect your soul, nigga.

Now it's proven it's about to be a misunderstanding
In furniture moving, bullets flying, lawyers & mothers suing
Cause niggas don't know the difference, you bitches just stick to fiction
It's sickening, you can't even walk in my jurisdiction rippin' it,
Grippin' the pump and who wanna fuck with a walking psychopathic
Pyromaniac shady cats with 80 gats
And maybe that's the reason that you gon' get it the worst a
And since you jumpin' in front of everybody you gon' get it first
I disperse the crowd with something vigor and versatile
So go on and record you verses now while you got a mouth,
And it's not a joke, it's some kind of riddle,
Kunizzle will lift up a 12 gizzle and throw a party from my equittle,
And a glock that ? stop you from waking,
Bullets'll hit your liver, I'll even shoot native Americans,
A ? nigga, we back in you life and back in your wife,
Hit you in the back with a knife and get it crackin' tonight.

Git Up Now!
Lets get it cracking, Git, Its on and popping
Its D12 is back up in this bitch, uh, there ain't no stopping
We're gonna get it crackalatin

Say no more for trying to play the wall and quit hating
Git Up Now!
Notice you're sitting, what the fuck is you deaf
You motherfuckers don't listen, I said,
We bout to get this motherfucker crackalatin'
Quit, procrastinating
What the fuck you waiting for get off the wall and quit hating

I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, til I see, what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep, in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work
For me, it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
'cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reasoning, speakin wit me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin, unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangster beat on himself
I see you D-12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too!

Now go to sleep bitch!
Die, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch! 
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?
And go to sleep bitch! 
Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep bitch! 
Why are you still alive? Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch!

We got you niggaz, nervous
On purpose, to hurt your focus, you'se not MC's, you'se worthless
You'se not them G's, you'se a circus, you'se no appeal, please
You'se curtains, you use words, cool heard, slurred in two thousand third
You'se purpin, you'se no threat, who's ya servin?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseeing the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You'se not the streets, you'se the desk
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the debt

Now go to sleep bitch!
Die, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch! 
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?
And go to sleep bitch! 
Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep bitch! 
Why are you still alive? Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch!

Hey dog, I'ma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'ma stay blazin New York wit the heat
Stalk on the beat, walk wit my feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy-going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get, when dog gon bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ, and my Blood Line is tight
'cause it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line, and, we can go track for track
Damn dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that?

Now go to sleep bitch!
Die, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch! 
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?
And go to sleep bitch! 
Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye!
Go to sleep bitch! 
Why are you still alive? Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch!

Rot, motherfuckers, rot! Decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfucking dirt!
Die nameless, bitch, die nameless! No more fame!
Ahhh! Hahahaha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, haha

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

Lately, I really
Feel like I'm, rollin' for delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losin' control of myself
I sincerely, apologize if all that I sound like
Is I'm complaining, but life keeps on complicating
And, I'm debating on, leaving this world this evening
Even my girls can see that I'm grieving
I try and hide it but I can't
Why do I act like I am all high and mighty
When inside I'm dying, I am finally realizin' I need, help
Can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been having ups and down
Going through peaks and valleys
Dilly dallying, around with the idea
Of ending this shit right here
I'm hating my reflection
I walk around the house trying to fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah
I look fat, but what do I care
I don't give a fuck, only thing that I fear is Hailie
I'm afraid that if I close my eyes then I might see her, shit

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom
Napping at noon, yeah dad's in a bad mood
He's always snapping at you
Marshall what happened that you
Can't stop with these pills, and you've falling off with your skills
And your own fans are laughing at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle
Get up, be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart, ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, nobody, he'd fight first
But dwelling on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm popping Vikes, Percs, and Methadone Pills
Yeah Em tight verse, you killed it
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like Yes-Men
And they gon' do whatever I says, whenever I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it I guess then

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

(Don't know what I'm going through,
But I just keep on going through changes)

My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame, and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you
Whacha want me to do?
I'm starting to live like a recluse, and the truth is
Fame is starting to give me an excuse
To be at a, all-time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watching the same damn D-V-D of the
First tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurts, so I fast forward
Sleeping pills would make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfucking right
I ain't slowing down for no one
I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on dole 'em out
Daddy don't you die on me
Daddy better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

(Don't know what I'm going through,
But I just keep going through changes)

Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes
Plus somehow I'm pulling through
Swear when I come back, I'm ma be bullet proof
I'm a do it just for proof
I think I should state a few
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
See it just hit me, that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things that I would have never got say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailey this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together hey
Wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'll do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things, to explain
When it rains, guess it pours, guess it does
Wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placing any blame, I ain't pointing fingers
Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture, almost as if to say
I miss you sub-consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say
I guess I'm

I'm going through changes, I'm going through changes

Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep going through changes

Woo, damn
There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight boy
I'm about to get drunk
Let's hold down
Where the bar at?

Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more focus, hobo's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw a Heineken beer
Put it to the side and invite here to "Cheers"
Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama
Prepare for a player, who workin' with a monster
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masturbate
Why settle and wait, let's Escalade to the nearest Super Eight
Until your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin' booty cheeks
Come on

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 

Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
And she caught me starin'
And my homies darin' me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla 'cause I got a lot of DeNiro 
The DJ's playin' Obie's song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin' home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't want to be headin' home
With some double D's full of silicon
Ten hood rat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside
Bustin' at the bitches screamin' "off to they rides!"

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 

Okay rolie polies everywhere
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin' and she got me fearin'
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally
Like a box of Cherrios
Carry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses petite, no window drapes

Word to mother, they god damn Okra and beans
Got ya Oprah and jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 

And this is my favorite song
Now sing along, when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 

Ha ha, ha ha, ha
You gotta have teeth baby
It just wouldn't look right
Look, me big lips
You no teeth, it wouldn't work
You know what I'm sayin'
Yeah
I'm feelin' good
Shady Records man
Obie Trice, come on

What would it take to push a man,
Far enough to put somethin material over a human life?
What would drive someone completely over the edge
To do some shit like that? the green and gold.

I done filled my lungs up
With so much of this crack smoke
My necks bloated, my techs loaded,
I'm flat broke, and I'm pissed off,
Mad at the world I've had it with girls
And I'm frustrated, ran to the bus stop,
Just made it and hopped on 
Ready to drop bombs on the first person who had a nice suit and a watch on
I spot JOHN a white collar worker
In clean cut, walked up to em
He was like what? whatchu mean what? you know what time it is man
At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch with that diamond wrist band.
Got his green and his gold dashed it climbed in his van to steal it and seen
A man holdin' a nine and then
Shot him from the bottom up
Stole his keys, put em inside the ignition and got em stuck, 
Hopped out to flee on my feet, 
Fucked around, forgot that I left my ID on the seat

Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off, and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty
Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44-D

Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion

Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombest?!
We blowing up your house, killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus

Because I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more, because I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before

Sabateur; walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul-style galore, verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!

What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream
A nightmare 

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspicious,
When I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
From Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are krypton-ite
To the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into them, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind, Superman
'Cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
"I remember it clearly, even today"
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned
Always itchin' for something to do, was flipping
Through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition shoes
You get them LL Cool J coolin' systems
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this that's how I know my mission
Little boom box boomin', spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit
Never quit, too persistent

Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp position
If you got dissed at the shop 'cause if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocked us once, it ain't knocking again
It tried ding dong ditching shit
I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen slim
Snot forgin' like cocksuckers and rocks in the wind
Now I got my pot to piss in
Spottin' the top of this chain
Cuppin' over the opposition
Lookin' like a dog that's pissin'
Wake up on the competition
Promise incomplete
Diamond and Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
Ali's my colleague bombin' them probably
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like Adomakin
I'm rushing like your cranium LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place
To battle bitch I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
'Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now wish you pink birds, ooh no more drippin' in bird shit,
This songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but discourage any rappers the rap games God
But the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
'Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells
And doors ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first
As you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast to get served
Blood thirst, revenge of the nerds

And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
With the uncle Ron I'm turning into an non-humble Don
You blind dumbos, all I got is dick for you to crumble on
So stop the show, but I need a drum roll for I go on
Better back away from the front row, get lunch, I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutombo on the fucking jumbo tron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yarn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The goat just ate eight acres, and ate the vet
Who just make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper
Oh look, my notebook with smoke cook
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot
It's hard to breath floating like oak wood was burning
Return of the no good and I wont 

And a gauntlet, with a chain henge, its like a groundhogs day
So crowd around y'all, 'cause you may, see about y'all hey

Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
He decides to rob a liquor store

But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play

Alright, stop! 
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence 
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade

Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns

Fuck that!  Do that shit!  Shoot that bitch!
Can you afford to blow this shit?  Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?  Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! 
Not over this shit 
Drop the biscuit 
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. 
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play 
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?  
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there

No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!

Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man.

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!
Wait!  What if there's an explanation for this shit?

Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay!  Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?  (What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'm a kill you motherfucker!
Uh-ah!  Temper temper!

Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it
What am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?

Been there, done that, aw fuck it
What am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called 'Hi! My Name Is' dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
'Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've been against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else that can relate to my story?
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are

I was afraid to
Make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, 
Guts over fear, 
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
 Guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it was like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in the trailer park?
And the window that was closing and there's nowhere else I can go with flows in
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I'd rather make 'Not Afraid 2' than making another mothafuckin' 'We Made You' uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
And enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my damn self
But on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt that one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
Everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was gone

I was afraid to
Make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I never before
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love
Run out of excuses with every word
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, 
Guts over fear, 
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
 Guts over fear, guts over fear

Ayo this Chris Lodi, FUCK YOU IRV GOTTI!
No subliminals
Hollering all in the back, we heard you

Bitches wearin rags in photos, Ja's words bein' quoted
In the SOURCE, stealin 'Pac's shit like he just wrote it

Gimme this pill, exstacy got me feelin so
Invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a fuckin mad man who screams
Like I'm 'Pac but I'm not, enemies, Hennesy
Actin like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm CRAZY
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fuck from this shit

Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, fucker

RADIO CHANGING

Em you claim your mothers a crackhead and kim is a known slut so what's Hailie gon be when she grows up?

 
D-D-D-Didnt say

Hailie, come here baby.  Bring daddy his oscar.  We're gon shove it up Ja Rule's ass.

I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple 
I'm quick to murder ink with lead and talkin' bout a pencil
Lookit what the fuck you done got into 
I see you found yo niche, you just a bitch wit a menstrol
Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong 
You put 'e' before the 'd' cuz that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a regular guy 
If Pac was still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real 
Life is more than imitating niggaz and eatin' pills
And kind of muthafucka ruins three deals 
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated 
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover cuz he need it
And all you niggaz hatin', shut you mouths 
It's just that real niggaz ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out

Do-ra-mi, but we don't sing muhfuckas 
So Murder Inc. do ya thing muhfuckas
You've unleashed on a team who expects nothin' less 
Than R&B comin' from that regime
?? It's a little extreme 
Neck and necks with soldiers, muhfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing 
Weave eye-witness team on the tv screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green 
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a muthafuckin actor slash Pac impersonatin' rapper 
Slash Billie Holliday how it happen?
Artist for Repetuar saw him in action 
Pac assassination Def Jam grabbed him
Told him reinact him, you go platinum 
They seen it for sure, I know that Afina Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffery Atkins reinactin' her boy 
So I'm click-clackin' this toy
Mash and destroy, Shady
Aftermath and Detroit muthafuckas 

CHORUS
Do-ra-me, fa-so-la-ti-da 
Don't blame me cuz you lost your boss's spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa 
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac
Don't make me, too hot and you're not 
Shootin' at me, with the only shot you got
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac 
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop

Now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs 
To the greivance and the cryin' and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook you half of a half-way crook, get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late greal one 
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga please, stick to the script 
before the guns stick to the clip, and Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
Fuckin' old ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen 
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on 
Is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch made man, now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a tyrannasaurus rex?
You niggaz can scream holler and curse 
Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta ya purse

Slim did it simple to get at the wankstas 
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on 
But you ?? the ?? for sucking your ??
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz? 
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business you ain't caught the concept 
You talkin' nonsense to walk and find press
Contact was blown by Munsetta in The Source 
Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on ya porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us 
But Detroit niggaz ?? and ain't scurred to bust

Word to my nigga Bugs, punks like you get beat up 
Stomped unconcious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillic Pac or that transvestite who dress like a Lil Kim fox, her chest like a little windbox 
press tight on the trigger of this glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat 
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video tryin mock Pac 
You 'Mockaveli', get your own identity 

CHORUS
Eminem overdubs chorus 
Yeah! 
Never say my little girl's name in a song again!
Fuckin' punk pussy little BITCH!
I'll fuck you up boy! 
Never! Never in your muthafuckin life! 
I'll choke the shit outchu little muthafuckin bitch! 
Hailie'll whip your muthafuckin ass.

That's right muthafuckas 
Shay records, whatchu know about it? 
Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule 
Nigga, this Obie Triceright here talkin to you muthafuckas 
Ja Rule punk ass... Yea! 
Fuckin Soul For Real ass... 
Nigga that's Soul For Real, 
That the nigga from Soul For Real! 
Candy Rain ass nigga... 
He got a deal now he rappin' 
You'ont know what's... faggot ass muhfuckas 
Get money to all my real niggas, man 
Obie Trice, D12, G Unit, 50 Cent... 
Hailie Jade!!! 
50 Cent 

 
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?

 
No honey, you guys are the same size

Yo, I can't sing good
I feel like singin'
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy

Yeah, I'm happy
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 

Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, 'cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes 

Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't abort
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look
I love my daughter more than life n' itself

But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Would of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

Woo!
I told you I can't sing
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said

If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what, daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you

Babe uh, yeah!
Girl, you my only one though aight, haha
You my baby, fuck all that shit
You're the one for me
Check it out.

Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
Cause the vibe you giving me now
Feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other women's around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house!
If I call, you're in route
There's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches!
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
Our intimacy is significantly different

You gon ride for me 
Then I'm gon ride for you 
If you put your mouth on me 
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do 
Any problem we can see it through 
Baby if you promise to be true 
I will never put my hands on you
Come on and think about it

We ain't even got to talk when we see each other
We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers
You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
Visions of you having my little man
We joke, you call me George Foreman
Cause I'm namin him O number four, me I'm three
Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be
I'm in the bathroom when you pee
She in the bathroom too when a nigga doo doo, you my boo boo
There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
Satisfy - this my bitch that ride
My bitch wit the pistol in the ride
A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide
No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggaz muffin
You're fucking wit her husband

Come on and think about it
You got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
Drama we overcome it if we out numbered
I promise it'll be us against a hundred
Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter
Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach
Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
Enough to call O her Baby Father
You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real
Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal
It's signed and sealed, you the only female
Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
Post bail and post up for sale
I swore, I swear we will always live well
Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
Who's gon stop up? nobody! we's that deal

If you gon stand by me 
Then I'm gon stand by you 
If you promise you'll be true
Then I'll never put my hands on you 
But! don't you play me for no fool  bitch!
Cause if I put my mouth on you 
After you put your mouth on someone else
Better find someone else new
Come on and think about it

Yeah.. Obie Trice
Shady!

Mom
I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink and

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause ma!
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together
Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's fifteen degrees and it's Christmas Eve 
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close 
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth
But I'm sorry mama for 'Cleaning Out My Closet', at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, 'cause
One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has met their grandma
Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

I want a new life
One without a cause
So I'm coming home tonight
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Just know that I was alright
And I was not afraid to die

Oh even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far, I want a new life

Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually
Said to myself: "I gotta meet her" like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue, you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the , hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it

All day, all night
You feel, my heat 
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore are like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull out behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it 
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air for some to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pep' Le Pew shit!
"Ain't steppin' to you, bitch," I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me

Letter, come to me, mail, sweater, heat, some degree, fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright
I ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it

All day, all night
You feel, my heat 
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring 
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl, your
Body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're
Just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too'look at my pedigree!
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it

Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin 
He's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
I wanna fuck, it's my big dick
So everybody get ready fucking now!

I want you, to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch I want the fans jumping
I want the fists, pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups
Shady's come to fill ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the E.R., we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no not even CPR from the EMT's
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
{*chka-chk-chk*} What's my name? Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them, cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
Cause this shit's getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin
Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-didi-da-da-da-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl you just hit the lottery

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose
Try to restrain us you can't contain us, we're still gonna make a stink
No matter what, we, do
Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse
To just, cut, loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose

This is when shit hits the fan, like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Like chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song's like a seance, it hums

It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off for what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the flo' baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah girl shake that caboose, I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose, a mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose, me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves, and we came here to retract the roof
Yeah man ain't that the truth, girl your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, and this is when all hell breaks loose

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose
Try to restrain us you can't contain us, we're still gonna make a stink
No matter what, we, do
Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse
To just, cut, loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose

Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm mur-ur-during the flow, liquid courage I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' ho
With speakers knocking it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop
"E" and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'

Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick
Right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hating on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat, "Dre fell off", that's news to me

Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose
Try to restrain us you can't contain us, we're still gonna make a stink
No matter what, we, do
Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse
To just, cut, loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell, breaks, loose

Yo, Slim Shady!
Yo, I'll fuckin, I'll
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you 
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fuckin' ground out from underneath you
 I ain't no fuckin' G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin' to shoot you,
I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers 
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin' up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses
And close it back with a lit match in it
While I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes

I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church 
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray every night 
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface
Nickel nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care

But every time I take a step it gets dim, tell me is this hell we're livin in

Hello  allow me to introduce myself 
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you 
It's been a long time  sorry I've been away so long 
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you 

Yea

You see that chick in the gym checkin' me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm wrecklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast where the heck is it now?
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'open sesame' mouth
Down the hatchet, the feelin' you can't match it
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
I tac-tac-tacin' the whore with the damn hatchet
I nap-sack-pack with like forty some Xanaxes
Shorty come back, I'm tryin' to score me some lap dancers
I'm 'bout to relapse so baby pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula forty-four and forty's with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And are you menstruating baby my little friend's waitin' to say hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin' like Jell-O
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Yea

My equilibrium's off, must be the Lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extracurricular
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of one fifty one
Fifty one people asleep in my damn livin' room
'Scuse me hun, but what was your name, Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked and uh, did we umm?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there doesn't seem to be one
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
like Speedy Gonzales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiendin' for some
My head is poundin' to the beat of the drum

Umm

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

Oh, Those were the days they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' the curtain for good

I second that and a third, rush to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He no longer gettin' the three hundred bucks for these Perk-idans
Buster's gettin' to be where he lustfully surged it in
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin' him'
Childishly on the phone tryin' to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he's doubling backwards and he's stumblin' back
Slipped and fell hit his backbone heard somethin' go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's bustin' a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just bustin' my own chops while I'm bustin' a rap
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it' I'm back

Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
So I'm hopin' that some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say hello

So I'm sayin
Hello  allow me to introduce myself 
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you 
It's been a long time  sorry I've been away so long 
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you 

NAH MAN, NOT QUITE FINISHED YET...

Girl I think you just might of tried to pull a motherfuckin' fast one; I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade, tryna play games, see this saw blade
See this silhouette of a stalker in your walkway, better cooperate
Or get suateed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
MC's get so quiet you can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
COLT SEAVERS on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like THE fuckin' fall guy
I don't gas my Mercedes AFTER MIDNIGHT, I treat it like a MOGWAI
Cuz it will turn into a gremlin, and run over kids, women and men
VRINN VRINN, motor so big you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch gimme them digits while you cringin'
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin will I spend spend
Even ten cents on you since when
Did you think it'll cost me a pretty penny
Shiit, if I think a penny's pretty, just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, catch an eskimo by his toe
While he's tryna roll a snowball
But, don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers better let him go y'all!

YOU DON'T KNOW ME
Now here we go, go go!

Get up baby, get a move on, like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
YOU WON'T EVER ever think of this shit, yeah honey you called?
Well here I come, havoc on a beat I reek it
Evil, I see, hear, and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfuckin' chicken before it hatches
Cuz you can bet your ass that, we gon' get it crackin'
Like the Kraken in Titans when they clashin'
Get your brains bashed in so bad you're gon' have Kurt Kobain askin'
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he's cool with it
Don't stand there and look stupid at me
Bitch I ain't in the mood for this shit
Get my dick GOOGLED UNTIL it pops up
Y'all ARE so motherfuckin' full of shit that YOU'RE stopped up
Me I'm always shittin' diarrhea OF THE mouth
Til your speakers crap out, pfft, huh what?
Girl you got a hot butt, like a lit cigarette
 But you won't get a hot fudge sundae
From me so don't strut my way, slut because...

YOU DON'T KNOW ME
Now THERE we go, go, go!

And now that I got your panties in a bunch and your bowels in an uproar
Imma show you why I came so you stop asking me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt whore, I know you want more
Bitch it's time to put the math back IN THE Mathers cuz I'm a fuckin' , run boy
Every flow got it mastered, so every last word that you fuckin' fags heard
COMES straight from the bitches ass, yeah in other words I'm a bas
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank, yeah still plenty
No morals are instilled in me so remorse, I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out Hannibal, understandable
Why you're jealous, fuckin' animal, I got cannibal
MAGNETISM CAN'T RESIST 'EM now can ya hoe?
Shady I don't understand your flow, understand my flow
Bitch I flow like TROY POLAMALU'S hair boy
Don't you dare try to follow or compare boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare, stay the fuck outta my hair boy
You can look, you can stare and point, but you can't touch, I'M TOO CLAIRVOYANT?
I don't get it man is there a void, all this weak shit, what am I steroids?
Well bitch I'm back, with some shit for that ass
And your trunk, elephant, 
And remember boys...

YOU DON'T KNOW ME
Now here we go, go go!

Thank you for coming out!
Hope you enjoyed the show!
Until next time' haha
Peace! 

Yeah huh

Turn the mic up a little bit

Get some of this Cali weedo

Listen to some motherfuckin'

Haha
(Sounds like gold, sounds like street, whoo
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did
The rump bumpa bum bum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C)

Hip hop,  That's the way of life
If you think you're nice, then go grab the mic
Let me tell you my story, cause everybody got one
Grab the pen and pad, and start to jot some
Always told myself, that I would never be losin
Man, I ain't have no hood, my mother was always movin
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit
Goddamn, mama, what's the point?
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags
Jump in the truck, with my step-dad
When I was 10 years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older, then the force got stronger
And me and my rap partner wasn't seein' eye to eye
So we picked up and started a group with some other guys
This is hip hop 
Man, I won't stop
Yo Big Boi! "What up?" Give me a beat box

Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop 
Hip hop!
Sounds like gold, sounds like street, 
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did 
The rump bumpa bum bum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C

From the hip hop Shop to Maurice Malone
Ten years later, I'm still in the zone
7 Mile and Foyer where a star was born
United we stand, divided we swore 
Hell yeah, I looked in my car
Bitch, I was homeless, I slept in a jar
And Dirty Management, I wish y'all the best
But me and my niggas had to do what's best, it was a mess
All them taxes and accounts
Checks started to bounce, niggas couldn't by an ounce
And now that we platinum, they diss our name
Like we won't go the car and get them things
And beef, sometimes you don't have a choice
From the fight with Whitey Ford to the Beastie Boys
To the Ja Rules, Benzinos, and the niggas in the club
To the E Dubbs and niggas that you ain't heard of
And man, I don't know how to use a gun
But I'll learn quick if the fuckin' beef come
{gun sprays}

Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop 
Hip hop!
Sounds like gold, sounds like street, 
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did 
The rump bumpabumbum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the M-P-C

Man, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop
I'd rather be fishin' in flip flops, flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, and I
Can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar
Riff to Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seeger
When I was younger I was so eager
To have a gun, I would do the same
Couldn't wait to get to the shootin' range
Me and my man Goofy Gary just tryna let loose some steam
Motherfuckers laughin' cause I couldn't aim
So I pulled the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thing
I used to have this theory, keep three bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no C-C-W license
I tried to apply for one, they said it take 5-6 months
What the fuck am I supposed to do meanwhile when rivals come?
Hide that son of a bitch in the glove box or inside the trunk
Now back to what my three-bullet theory was
I'm triple-platinum, I ain't tryna catch no murder 1
Figured I'd shoot the womb, probably missin' at least one
But the other one's fuck his shoulder and his knee cap up
And I'm a say for self-defense how come I had the gun
Is because I was at the range, on my way back from
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I'll get a year for each bullet at the most as opposed to
Havin' a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
But it gave me power, and it made me crazy
And psychotic, I just got retarded
Once I got and I thank God it was empty the night I got caught with it
What the fuck man, I thought that it was supposed to be

Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop 
Hip hop!
Sounds like gold, sounds like street, 
Niggas know they gettin' told what they mama did 
The rump bumpabumbum in the jeep
These people know what I do with the MPC

How come we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now
After all the years we been down
ain't no way no how, this bullshit can be true
We family and ain't a damn thing changed, unless it's you

So young, so full of life in vibrant side by side wherever you weres ridin i went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When ronnie died you weres right by my side with a sholder to cry on
Tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood i did
Sometimes i just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours
And mine i survived it, you ran the streets, i 9 to 5'd it
We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then i blew up
To both yours and mine surprises
Now i feel the vibe i just can't describe it
As much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold, you touch its like ice
In your eyes is the look of resenment
I can sense it, and i don't like it

It was my dream at first to be on spittin a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got burst
So i came out i woulda killed a nigga first
Before i let him disrespect me and check me over some worste
Some bitch that i wasn't with i would hit her then quit
But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved in it, you was smokin the chron with her
Comin out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk
Like why'all was husband and wife or somethin
But me catchin you fuckin other niggas musta hurt you pride or somethin
'cause you won't fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me
When all i tried to do was show your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced
You actin like i ain't you man and lyin like she can't be loose
But i am really you friend, i'm jus trying to tell you the truth
But don't hate the game or the player
'cause the one that is changing is you

You're only at the top 'cause my homie had to stop
Now we actin like i gotta live only for the block
Homies in the hood only she be on the tube
Only gossip on the porch get to speakin on who
Fools i used to rap with all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin and *poof* it jus happen
But PROOF is jus actin out the party was stoned
Shady made it so my babys ain't starvin at home
See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends
Whenever real intelligence that's forever till the end
I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives
And wastin my times with these snakes in disguise
 when you talk its with bitter is fight
And  it's my fault for what you did with your life
And everytime i go to hear you and play you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

Yo check this out! In life, you got your want to be's
You got your going to be's, and you got your has been's
Then you got your hustlers and hardcore

Oh a line with fakes a time
Fresh time, with sure more times
Jimminy two time respect mine
Big click with breakfast and blacklist
War! War! War! War!

Vision, knocking you out motherfucker listen
Superstition can help you in this battle
G's and sandles who surround you in all the angles
All over your shit in shamble
Looking the little of latter you fucking runt

Hustlers! Hustlers and Hardcore!
Giving you more than what you asking for!

Danger hander
Banging swinging banner all single hander
Hit the left propaganda
I'll manner bad grammar stander

Got the people chasing with cameras by the manner
Hit and slap us, so pajamas
Hiding under clothes in dirty hampers
Happy brands will make them happy campers

Little laughter
Shit nappers

I'll puke eat and freak you
Battle, I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you

And force feed you them both and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I lift you off your feet so fast with a round house
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
I ain't no fucking g, I'm a canibal

I ain't trying to shoot you, I'm trying to chop you into pieces and eat you
Rap you in rope and glass, strapped to a soakin matress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis

Take this. 
You ready? 1.. 2.. 3! 

The more you, put me through, 
The more it makes me wanna come back to you, 
You say you hate me, I just love you more, 
You don't want me, I just want you more, 
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me, 
I know it's sad but it's makin me happy, 
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on, 
Cuz you love me, and I love you more.

It's sick, but who could ever predict,
We'd be doin' the same shit,
We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
We do it for us, it's lust,
Cuz neither one of us trusts each other,
So we fuck 'til we bust,
Then we cuss each other, out,
We know what it's about,
Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
You throw me out the house,
I throw you on the couch,
Punch you in the mouth,
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
And apologize after,
Laughter, pain, it's insane,
We're back in the same chapter again,
And it's sad but it's true,
When I'm layin' here with you,
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.

Cuz I hate you, do you hate me?
Good cuz you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
It makes me wanna just take you,
And just throw you on the bed,
And fuck you like I don't even know you,
You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,
You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
We're both evil in our ways,
But neither one of us would ever admit it,
Cuz one of us would have one up on the other,
So forget it,
We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
But they ain't got proof,
'Til they do it's just the two of us,
It's you and me, cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
But you gotta believe me to a degree,
Cuz if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
Yeah I would cuz the sex is too damn good,
If I ran who would I run to,
That would be this soft and warm,
So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
But at least we know that we share this common bond,
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,
I hope, the only reason that I cope,
Is cuz of that fact,
And plus I can bust in that,
And that's why...

I could never understand it,
That's why I don't try,
From junior high until we both die,
It's silly ho why must we try,
Is it really so rough,
That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
Try to pull each other's legs,
Until the other begs,
We're liein' to ourselves,
That's the beauty of it yeah,
Cuz we truly love each other,
That's why we always fight,
And all we do is shove each other,
Every other fuckin' night,
And it's clear it ain't gonna change,
It's pent up rage,
We both have,
We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
We've both been,
Someone else's someone else,
Problem is neither one wants help,
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
Our family's mixed up,
There's a baby sister in the mix,
And it hurts cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
But I won't be made a fool of,
If this is true love,
You wouldn't do what,
You did last time,
You wouldn't screw up,
This time,
Cuz this time girl,
I'm tellin you what,
You do it again I'm fuckin you up,
No matter what...

What you say, what you do,
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
Right behind you, in your nightmares,
All the flowers, and the candy,
All the times that you threw it back at me,
You say you hate me, you gon' hate me more,
When you find out, can't escape me whore.

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realise what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck's sake

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
bring me back to life, bring me back to life,
I need 

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the crackers' ass, little crack a jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags and as I'm leavin'
I'll guarantee they scream, "Dre, don't leave us like that man!" cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

Your mother, you fuckin faggot

La da da, da da da, da da 

Aiyo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we aint forget about you, you fuckin homo
We still remember

There once was a man who liked to jump around 
But he got too old to jump up and down 

So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up 

Started singin the blues like there was no tommorrow 
 Left his boys in the House of Pain 
It was the wisest decision he ever made 
But the dumbest thing that he could ever do 
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do 

Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago 
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more

I remember back when you had The Knack 
And I remember when you had your first heart attack 
I was right there laughin when I heard the news 
I just wish the cardiac would'a murdered you 
 Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch 

You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich

But the dumbest thing that you could ever do 
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do 

yo  yo  yo 
Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When house of pain was out of fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when i first had heard The Knack
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man
I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound rediculous you dickless piece of shit,
How could you diss me, bitch?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude,
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin, then you left the room 
and didn't say goodbye or nothin?
Like you was mad that someone else was
White and tried to rhyme or somethin
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
But you're a homosexual, white rappin Irish {*Muslim*}
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a {*Muslim*} too
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you? 
I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
Knowin I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues

x2

You fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy, fuck
And by the way, a 380's a fuckin sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin real gun
You little bitch
Next time say my fuckin name in a song
Don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin diss me, diss me you fuckin faggot
You fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin little bitch, fuckin cunt

Aiyyo Head, that's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker!

{*beat changes to 2Pac's "Hit 'Em Up"*}

Kill Whitey! - Hahaha
Kill Whitey! - Detroit! What? What?
Kill Whitey! - .. yo, yo
Kill Whitey! - Haha! Look

First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em comin while you runnin out of breath
Steady duckin while I'm punchin at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
with your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with
real
MC's
who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
but Everlast might die tonight, haha
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know!

Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
but you 'bout to get relapsed any minute
Honkey, I hit 'em up!

Hahaha, yo
check
this out
You faggots ain't even on my level
I'ma let D-12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots!

Yo! Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin back
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch

Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik
Where's your House of Pain now? There's only one of you Erik
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round
with some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin Belle Isle Bridge

Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
this ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin killed
with his chest open
Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
on his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop
while my
sales
makin records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit 'em up!

I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got an uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut

What the fuck?! Is you stupid?
I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord
and
stuff
him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
with sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaraunt locked and block your door
Cause we "Hit 'Em Up" like motherfuckin Tupac Shakur

You a, "Black Jesus," heart attack seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country

{*laughing*}
Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off
{*needle drags, beat stops*}

Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise
I just believe in kickin a man while he's down
God damn! I quit
Mention my daughter's name in a song again you fuckin punk

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

I murder a rhyme one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that nine it ain't gonna help
What good is it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as hell
Manson  you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox 
I used to give a, fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press I'm stressed
Too much stares two breasts, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick 
Grew up quick  was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-T-E,
'Cause M-T-V was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips bitch, what, my mouth isn't working?
You hear this finger? Oh it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

I take each individual degenerates head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational {Back is the incredible!}
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the, internet
Trying to, lure your kids with him, into bed
It's a, sick world we live in these days
"Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
Mind with no sense in it, fried to get so frenetic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smokin' 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin' lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin' out
all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
A Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
Cause  Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring 
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this!
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady 
I'm back   I'm back

Guess who's b, back, back
Gue' gue' guess who's back 
Guess who's back
Gue' guess who's back
D-12, Guess who's back
Gue' gue' gue' gue' guess who's back
Dr. Dre, Guess who's back
Back back, back
Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt, fuck

Yeah, it's my life
My own words, I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much
You'd give an arm for
Not the expression, no
Literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
"Daddy look what I made"
"Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy where's mommy?
I can't find mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself"
I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream
I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'"
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, daddy you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "you got one more chance to do right
And it's tonight, now go out and show 'em that you love 'em before it's too late"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
But baby we're in Sweden
How did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy
You told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want
They want you, Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!
You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real"
I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Cock it, put it to my brain, scream "die Shady!" And pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up
Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Torture chambers, secret passageways, vats of acid, and deadly vaults

Guess who's back?
Damn, it feels good to be back
I'm having a relapse

How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail, now what the hell is his problem?
Well, to be honest the smell of these chronic
leaves make me hella demonic
They compelled me to kill this elderly man and
I get these panic attacks
Pop a Xanax, relax
Tryin' to stick my fuckin' dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist
Get gassed, man it's kick-ass
The first thing I put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man it ain't too late
to have a change of pace and take it off and show my face
so you can see the things you facin'
Slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you makin', ain't you?
Well thank you, Jason
There goes one more coma due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more soma and I'll be done for, mama
Go in the damn broom closet
Another Valium, lost it
Shovin' the vacuum nozzle down the bathroom faucet
It seems like every day I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen month-old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breakin' his neck in eighty-some places
Baby he's Shady comes lady
He's got the razor ba-blades 
and the ch-ch-chain-s-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums
Yeah, here I come come
You hear the rumbling? VRUM VRUM!
There's something inside of that blue ? and that drum drum
My head and torso of someone, where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long blonde 
hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly there's something wrong cause she didn't come home
She's missing, where is she? Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now everybody get your dance on to my dance song, come on

Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough 
Told you how to slap dicks and murder your girl 
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, "Fuck the world!"
 so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot 
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot 
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop 
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'm a come and kill you

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
 I'm Shady!

I like happy things,
I'm really calm and peaceful 
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things
That make me happy and gleeful 
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool 
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life 
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice 

How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet 
So bring the money by tonight, cause your wife
Said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life 
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school 
'Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
 I'm Shady!

I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it

Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit

People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit 
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject 
And if I told you I had aid y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack  don't do coke, I do smoke weed 
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer 
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead 
She's still alive and bitchin' 
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being aids infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a mini-thin
 I'm Shady!

I told you I was Shady!

Y'all didn't wanna believe me!
I'm Shady!
And that's my name

Check Check, 1-2 , 1-2 1-2 
Yea yea yea Dr. Dre up in here y'all know what this is.
It's what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap,
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby.
Yo Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby

I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident

I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it ain't latching, and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it

Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking self's at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedation? 
Anyway I got down with Dre  

The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, "Fuck the Police"
When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth
 Became a role model after Colorado

Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo!
Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't

'Cause you'll probably want to stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
 I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking

Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'mm juss high on life

So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers, Slim Shady

Dr Dre!

I'm drunk pass the tec

Eminem and Dr. Dre 
Cause if I get locked up tonight!
Then I might not come home tonight!
	
Keep it moving! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On

The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron 
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake
Don't get so bent out of shape 

'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up

And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove 
Shit, talk about your brain being baked

My shit's still in the oven on 480 De-Grades
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby,
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady
You critics want to criticize but couldnt visualize

Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth

And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit

Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it

But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge

I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old

Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do 

Life
By Marshal Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
In front of your optical to slow you down

And every time you think you gotten past it
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies, with secret identities
And disguises, to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'

What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down

What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and many things
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at five fifty an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
Tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics

If I had a magic wand,
I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on,
While I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough,
Because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass
For the whole world to kiss

I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home
To have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a B-M
Tired of not working at G-M, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol P-M
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blond whore
After work in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns

Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me when nobody's as ill as me
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J-L-be	 saying "Where Hip-Hop Lives"

But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john

If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass
For the whole world to kiss
You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
Know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin'?
Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up
That's my word

In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin' your head up high
When you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
Case you're wonderin' why my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine so I'm
Pickin' them up and stuffin' them back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of relapse

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
Isn't it though amazing, back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it, did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I ever seen
And back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I didn't  mean and  just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy and lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my

What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby
Back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your mother fucking mind
We represent the 313, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, they don't know shit about this, for the '96

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxing, a zany acting maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
Twist the necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue
Turn your system up, twist 'em up
And indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more car-tunes than animation
My lamination of nar-er-ration, hits a snare and bass
On a track for duck rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be starin' gazin'
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland; I'm Infinite

You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

Bust it, I let the beat commence
So I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince
A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leakin' like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral
Is deeper than a Jeep-full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one
Imitator, intimidator, stimulator
Simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces
My a cappella releases classic masterpieces
Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally
Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense
And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant
To do some shit that represents the MO
So I'm assumin' all responsibility
'Cause there's a monster will in me
That always wants to kill MC's
Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric-smugglin' embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool
Then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin'
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, 'cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit, and tempted
When I see the sins my friends commit; I'm Infinite

You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

You heard of Hell, well, I was sent from it
I went to it, servin' a sentence
For murderin' instruments
Now I'm tryin' to repent from it
But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted
To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite

'95, '96 
And on and on and on 

I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said "I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead"
"Debbie don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you
I bet he probably just want's to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course, unless you object"
"Ahh go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head"

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!

"Did you get him?" Naaw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything, except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah mainiac, that's Shady dog
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog
Shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!

Don't you know what felch means? Yeah, well then tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching
Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step father felt me
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
"Shady what the fuck you saying?" I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting
"Marshall I just love you boy, I care about your well being"
No Dad, I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me
She showed me a movie like "Nightmare on Elm Street"
But it was X, and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
"Well this is called ass rape, and we're shooting the jail scene"

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!

Intro: 
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this... what is this...
The Invasion! yeah yeah Green Lantern! The infiltration! We're comin'!
Yeah!

I got 50 Cent, I got G-unit, D-twizzy in this bitch, wit' obie trice
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name, cuz you say one more thing, it won't be nice

Here we go,
I shoulda known 
I was bound to get pulled
into some bullshit
sooner or later 
you litte haters 
are too jealous of us to love us
you hate it, 
G-unit made it, 
then Obie's coming,
D-twizzy's comin, ya sick to 
ya stomach
50 percent of it's 50 Cent,
the other 50 percent of it's whose color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' takin' our label down,
you better find our building 
and fly a fuckin plane into it
But I ain't tryin to get to intricate into it, 
I'm just tryin to give you a little hint for your own benefit
cuz then it's gonna get to the point 
where it escalates into some other shit, 
then I'm a flip 
then I'm a get to
stompin' in my Air Force once, 
won't be able to tell if its two purrs or it's one
Cuz it's gone feel like so many feet kickin you, 
you think Nike just made these cleats into shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be,
but I get a woody, 
when these pussies try to push me
thinkin they gone put me in a position to pickle me
yall tickle me pink, 
I think I'd just rather have pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock tickety tock tickety,
a little bit of the diggety doc
diggety mixed with a little bit of the 
what a small pinch, 
biggy look at me, 
I'm just a bomb diggety

We the realest lable, we'll try to act like you don't feel our lable
cuz we gone fuck around and kill your lable! Obie, D-twizzy, G-unit, 50, Shady 
records we the lable for sho!
We the realest lable, we'll try to act like you don't feel our lable
cuz we gone fuck around and steal your paper! Obie, D-twizzy, G-unit, 50, we're 
gone kill your fuckin lable for sho!

Shady in the place to BC, cuz I got what it takes to rock tha mic RIGHT!
still watch what you say to me ho cause im off probation in less than 6 MONTHS! 

ha ha, whooo, Shady records, still Aftermath, and don't think we don't hear you 
muthafuckas talkin, cuz we do, we see y'all, but we just gone sit back for a minute 
and see what the fuck y'all do!

I've got a riddle, what's little and talks big
with midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
that'll do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walking the whole Mediterranean
is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tazmanian,
No he's name's Raymond and oh, oh sorry yo
So sorry wow, but that was a long time ago
When I was just Joe Shmo, rapping in Joe Blow's basement
I apologized fo' it before, so
Either accept it or you don't
And let's move on, if I aint shown that I've grown
Then get the bone, keep licking these nuts,
You industry mutts, keep walking around sniffing each other's butts
Or should I say asses?
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses?
The question I ask is..
How can I explain this?
How can I swing this, in English language?
If I switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
do I do it in vein, or simply to entertain?
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water
Woady on my daughter I told you I love this culture
don't let em insult ya, I'ma tell you one more 'gain
this is the environment I was brought up 'in
but every now and 'then, I use my 'pen
to get rid of some frustration, or should I say shon
this is just another one of my subliminal ways to racism
you're face is numb, you're stunned you look as cold
like that of a man who's 70 some years old
and it only gets colder, which is why I understand
it can't be mad at a forty four fan
with a chip on his shoulder
who only owns half of a magazine, and the only way to have it seen
is to put me on the front of it again
only think that makes him grin, is to see me frown
papa can't stand me, papa needs to take his medication and sit the **** down
in his new chair that goes round and round
that he bought from new money of his bank account
that I get him every issue when the thang comes out
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side
yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride
but aint nobody over here buying two white guys
disguised as pro-black there's no slack for a Hartford college grad.
In a fitted hat and a hunch bag, standing by the clearance coat rack
And some RSO throwbacks, yeah

Ih.. ih, ih 
It has been, it has been, it has been
It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead {what?}
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money power respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself goin out as a hero {uhh}
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many Biggie backed off of {ha ha ha}
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
these tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest {uh-huh}
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

Since B.I.B. taught us niggaz to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious {what?}
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencin the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin, goin through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When _Ready to Die_ was a sick part of my life {yeah}
Palmin that forty-five, plottin to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh? {uh-huh}
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I.

I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passin {what?}
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace...
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother...
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back {yeah}
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin "God bless"
Regardless to critics yellin that East/West
I seen the game losin, I'm just pressin the reset {uhh}
And when the ressurection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally!
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga!

 
Eye-Kyu: Check it out, 
Eminem: Hey Kyu! 

Eye-Kyu: 
Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok  
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  
It's a long year pretending I belong here  
It's a broke day but everything is ok  
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  
It's a long year pretending I belong here  

Verse 1: Eminem 
One day I plan to be a family man happily married 
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried 
Till I'm glad to be buried 
And leave this crazy world 
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl 
It may be early to be planning this stuff 
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough 
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough 
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed 
My hands have been cuffed 
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff 
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts 
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough 
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see 
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased 
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese 
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call 
Way before my baby is able to crawl 
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates 
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades 
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth 
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q 

Eye-Kyu: 
Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok  
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  
It's a long year pretending I belong here  
It's a broke day but everything is ok  
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  
It's a long year pretending I belong here  

Verse 2: Eminem 
I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps 
Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep 
Praying for sleep 
Dreaming with a watering mouth 
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse 
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts 
With the root of all evil 
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful 
And make them do shit illegal 
For these Grant's and Jackson's 
These transactions explain a man's actions 
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity 
Through God and there's a wish he granted me 
He showed me how to cope with the stress 
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed 
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest 
To selling dope with the rest 
I quit smoking cess to open my chest 
Life is stressful inside this cesspool 
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel 
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics 
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts 
Kids attract static, children with automatics 
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets 
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum 
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum 
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth 
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth 

Eye-Kyu: 
Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok  
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  
It's a long year pretending I belong here  
It's a broke day but everything is ok  
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  
It's a long year pretending I belong here  

Uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep 
Uh yeah, it's ok, it's alright, I can't sleep

It's like that Eminem, Eminem, all right bust it
It's only fair to warn I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward dropping an a capella
To chop a fella to mozzerella
Worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to you
Eating a full course meal, watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of slugs
So were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To recieving with their asses ripped out of their pants
And given a less than twenty percent chance of living
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Dr. Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy on you while you scream, "I'm still alive!"
Driving a rusty scalpal in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department I've hired an arsonist
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment

Men singing:
Jealous! 

Girls voice: 
Jealous!?! What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!!
He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, What do I got to be jealous for?
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean...

Verse 1:
I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
To many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company now you always bugging me 
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?

Chorus: Men Singing
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy 

Women's Voice: 
Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy

Verse 2:
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like 
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
And you was like,  **I need a new nigga** 
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
He goes, "You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"
Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...

Chorus: Men Singing
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy 

Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or albino, yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think we just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep makin' them tired old threads
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf, yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
'Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go bad
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to it, and I was like 

See us come to award shows we're like 
Can we get more of those, they're like 
See us keep blowin' up, we're like 
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in your videos, I'm like 
See me right up close, you're like 
And where is D12 at, they're like 
And where the fuck we goin', we're like 

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep comin' back, it only means you know you lost a fight
They wanna talk shit, let 'em talk shit, 'cause they talk shit
Knowin' deep down, they really just wanna squash it
'Cause no one wants to walk around, steppin' in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let 'em, inside's like 'Go get 'em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryin' to fight momentum?'
We just keep winnin', by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's, in any size yo' denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiyaa''
We ain't wire your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, Yes sir!
So full of joy, why am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yea boi don't curr'

See us come to award shows we're like 
Can we get more of those, they're like 
See us keep blowin' up, we're like 
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in your videos, I'm like 
See me right up close, you're like 
And where is D12 at, they're like 
And where the fuck we goin', we're like 

Yo' homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dawg, man life's not fair
Yo' friends shoulda known not to front 'round here
You see kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass, of your jewels, right here
Man I'm a say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Yo' girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You probably heard about me, I'm a shown up playa
In the hood politicin', like I'm runnin' for mayor
Ridin', winin', dinin' and shinin', know what I'm sayin'
I ain't got time for fuckin' around, and horseplayin'
I'm makin' hits, my homies takin' hits, who's stayin'

See us come to award shows we're like 
Can we get more of those, they're like 
See us keep blowin' up, we're like 
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in your videos, I'm like

And where is D12 at, they're like 
And where the fuck we goin', we're like 

Whoa!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is, what you thought it wasn't
It beez, the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out the man he goes by the name of er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-eighty, you Little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic 
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milk bone
I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up dis you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll dis your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials 
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!

Somebody let me out this limousine 
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin' "Fuck the world" like 2pac
I just don't give a fuck!
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you fittin' to get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck!

Hey, fuck that!

Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop
Pajama time
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap
As in a new case of child molestation accusation
Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise
I done touched on everything, but little boys
And that's not a stab at Micheal
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK 
Oops my C-D just skipped

Chance to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe till Monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
Get the top down, let my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someones gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's your name girl
What's your sign
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre aah aah
Beer goggles, blind

Go crazy
Aah aah aah aah aah
Oh baby

Oh baby baby aah aah

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming
Aah aah aah aah aah
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said save it boy
We got you on tape
Telling an old lady to "touch my body"
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now step back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit
You signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man
Chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba

When I just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' the shit
Cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't goin' shoot you
I'm a pull you to this bullet, and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You god damn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, Vrinn!
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

You better kill me!  I'm a be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't a said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too!  You ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady 
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you 
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady 
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you

Bitch I'm a kill you!  Like a murder weapon, I'm a conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
It ain't acid rap, I just rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops!  Is that a subliminal hint?  No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth

Bitch I'm a kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece!
Twice?  Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots!  I hope the weed will outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that!  I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin' I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play
I go the machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throat ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Til I have you at knife point, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up!  Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me!

Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

Ha ha ha, I'm just playin' ladies
You know, I love you

Aw look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy baby
Little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you.
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it now you're two
Baby you're so precious
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down bitch
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you

Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm about to do
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you?
Just leave me and love him out the blue
Oh, what's a matter Kim?
Am I too loud for you?
Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like all right
You want to throw me out? that's fine!
But not for him to take my place, are you out you're mind?
This couch, this T-V, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
Look at Kim
Look at your husband now!

I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now is he?
Little punk!

Shut the fuck up!

You think I give a fuck!
Come on we're going for a ride bitch

Sit up front

We'll be right back
Well I will you'll be in the trunk

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you

You really fucked me Kim
You really did a number on me
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up!

Oh God my brain is racing

What are you doing?
Change the station I hate this song!
Does this look like a big joke?

There's a four year old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat
In your living room, ha-ha
What you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him didn't you?

Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you asshole, yeah bite me
Kim, Kim!
Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly don't you

No you think I'm ugly

Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
I hate you! I hate you!
I swear to god I hate you
Oh my God I love you
How the fuck could you do this to me?

How the fuck could you do this to me?

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you

Come on get out

I said get out bitch!

Fuck you, you did this to us
You did it, it's your fault
Oh my God I'm crackin' up
Get a grip Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny wasn't it?

That was funny wasn't it?

See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adams apple sliced

And while this is goin' on
His son just woke up and he just walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut

So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should have known better when you started to act weird
We could've, hey! where you going? get back here!
You can't run from me Kim
It's just us, nobody else!
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha! ha! got you!

Ha! go ahead yell!
Here I'll scream with you!
Ah somebody help!
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you?
Now shut the fuck up and get what's comin' to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed! bitch bleed!
Bleed! bitch bleed! bleed!

So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't want to go on
Living in this world without you

Hey can we re, can we re-enact Biggie's song?
Can, can you shit on me?
I just want you to shit on me

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love

Baby, I'm extra large in magnitude
And Magnum's the lubrication that I use
To chose which hole on a hoe I abuse
Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who

When I fuck the shit out you, then the next day
I rush the shit out you off my two-way
You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own

No, I'm in and out your home
And this in and out your tone
I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around

I bounce 'em around, camcord the sex and sell 'em around town
Now how that sound?
If I was in love witcha, now you wanna clown
Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown

Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
You want a nut, nuttin' but what is you be

I'm internationally known baby but actually
There are few people who know how I am naturally
All you know is that I can act irrationally
When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV

So they label me this crazed loony rap bully
But truthfully that ain't the truth
And if you believe in that shit then you'll believe anything's true
And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally

But personally that actually works for me
'Cause the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
I'm a bachelor bitch and I ain't in no fast fury
To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers

'Cause see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully
But we do still make booty calls occasionally
But be damned if I end up back in that pattern
And we end up back at that God damn tavern

And havin' another d'j' vu, we seein' security
Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry
I got news for you bitch, your new curfew's early
You ain't home by 2:30

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love

See you lookin' at the life, you lookin' at the lights
You lookin' at the ice, you ain't lookin' at the Trice
You should look at some advice when I see he ain't nice
Despite the fact you think you the feisty type

Oh, love to fight, I love the drama
Love when my bitch get to cussin' out Yolanda
Find the Obie condom on the counter
Swingin' her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe

Least I ain't deceive and try to mislead
And sell a dream just to get you on my team
I came clean to keep down the beef
Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth

So what we do under the covers should stay between the covers
And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
On the front page cover of "Buzz's New Lovers"
And this is when the bitch get to showin' the true colors

'Cause the truth of it, everything that I do's public
And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
Guess who you just screwed, assume it's me and you've done it
And save da used rubber to show 'em the proof of it

But I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
But you better be careful of who you're doin' it to
'Cause you never know when the shoe
Could end up on the other foot and it backfires on you

'Cause you may think you want it then you want me, then you get me
Then you got me and you're fucked, 'cause you'll be stuck with me
For the rest of your life 'cause if I get attached to you
We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you

You'll be walkin' out the house and I'll run up and tackle you
Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
You don't think you're leavin' this house in that, do you?
Not till I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you

Have you walkin' out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
Front on me? Never
'Cause we gonna be together forever
Right bitch? Right bitch?

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love

Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
So I'm non complying at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward
And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
And he said that I eyeballed him

And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words

'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split
But I don't give a shit I'm fine as long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic, and my conquest is
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest

This is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my

Legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

Yo, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? 
He's tryin' to divide us, this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can't from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

And here's to where we all began, all began 
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am 
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing "The Star-Spangled Banner"
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

And here's to where we all began, all began 
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am 
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go 

Here's to where we all began, all began 
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am 
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down,
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm suppose to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to
I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader
My crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line, you just don't cross it, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did
I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it
I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it
It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it
Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks
That I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us
As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us
Strictly to show they support us
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back
And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man
If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking
'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wanted 
One moment 
Would you capture it or just let it slip? 

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now 
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked 
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No 
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes 
It don't matter, 
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke 
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping 
This world is mine for the taking 
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is boring, but super stardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter 
Lonely roads, God only knows 
He's grown farther from home, he's no father 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water 
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmo who flows 
He nose dove and sold nada 
So the soap opera is told and unfolds 
I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on 
Da da dumb da dumb da da 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage 
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged 
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher 
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my nine to five 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
'Cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus 
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama screamin' on and Too much for me to want to Stay in one spot, 
another day of monotony Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not 
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot. 
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better 

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

I never meant to...
Give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to...
Bring you to my world

And now you're lying
The corner cry-y-y-iiiiing

Something's burning, I can't figure out what 
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must just be the powder from the power of 
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon to be spouse's moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
'Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts ' brace
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo"
'Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario
Though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First, "No  you don't  under  stand 
I  don't  do  this for anyone, ever"
Yeah, that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiance
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow Tha Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-god dang Jigga on, eh
'Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin'

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

I told that bitch I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Sucking dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fucking Ferris Wheel
Fucking spinning on me
Fuck you think? We gon' get married still?
Fucking Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fucking feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fucking eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day." Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fucking with me
You cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killing him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talking cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing, "I hope she's good enough"
Meanwhile you're chasing her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the'

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)
And I told her (Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care)

So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasing me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, clich', it's all my fault anyway
She's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding
But just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fucking brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt
Hit a fucking tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried this stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved
 Woke up in a dream state, in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's laying next to me in bed
Directly aiming a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like
"Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checking into rehab."
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fucking dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text
I said, "Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling, "Rape!"
'Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of, 
"Wait, dinner at eight?"
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of

Love, love, love, love
L-l, l-l-l-love

Niggas, I'm still grinding , I still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this 
And I can't let y'all derail me, man
I got Young Kobie homey, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back,  we got them craps going on
And that yac going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from touring
It's whatever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life 
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

Right we wanna love alcohol
We wanna love guns, we wanna love money
We don't love no bitches, though

There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
Cause that's sort of unique cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamanie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night 
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollering rape
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots 'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big been taught Charli B'More to deep throat 

I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night 
I just wanna love ya
For the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin'
Hold you through the night

I love the burners
The money, the bunnies, I just wanna hold ya
I just wanna love ya

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me,
And I love it, wait
Where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, who's that dude
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe, when you're with them, you meet
And neither one of you, even know what hit 'em,
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick, of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em,
Now you're in each others face,
Spewing venom, and these words, when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em,
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments, when you're in 'em
It's the rage that's the culprit, it controls you both
So they say it's best, to go your separate ways,
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records, playin' over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance,
Life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave,
Out the window, guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn't mean and we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad, as mine is
You're the same as me, but when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, it wasn't you,
Baby it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away now
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk,
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time, there will be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

-Rihanna-
On the first page of our story
the future seemed so bright
then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
even angels have their wicked schemes
and you take that to new extremes
but you'll always be my hero
even though you've lost your mind

-Chorus-
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
but that's all right because I like the way it hurts
just gonna stand there and hear me cry
but that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie Ohhh, I love the way you lie

-Rihanna-
Now there's gravel in our voices
glass is shattered from the fight
in this tug of war, you'll always win
even when I'm right 'cause you feed me fables from your hand
with violent words and empty threats
and it's sick that all these battles
are what keeps me satisfied

-Chorus-

-Rihanna-
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
til the walls are goin' up
in smoke with all our memories

-Eminem-
This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
hush baby, speak softly, tell me I'll be sorry
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night
so I can push you off me
try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we're on,
two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
that we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky
together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
you hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
but together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'
this house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
with you I'm in my f-ckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

-Chorus-
Love the way you lie

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more

It's sick but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit
We say that we do it for our baby but we don't, we do it for us
It's lust, 'cuz neither one of us trusts each other so we fuck
'till we bust, 'till cuss each other out, we know what it's about
Shout 'till I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth, we fist fight
'till we turn this mother out and apologize after, laughter
Pain, it's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when i'm laying here with you
There ain't nothing anyone could ever say or ever do 'cuz

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more

'Cuz I hate you, do you hate me? 
Good, 'cuz you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You FUCK other people and I FUCK other people
You're a SLUT, but i'm equal, i'm a MUTT, we're both evilin our ways 
but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cuz one of us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumours
But they ain't got proof, 'till they do, it's just the two of us
You and me, 'cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me
But you gotta believe it to a degree 'cuz true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin', yeah I would 
'Cuz the sex is too damn good, if I ran, who would I run to
that would be this soft and warm? So it's off and on
Usually more off then on but at least we know that we
Share this common bond, you're the only one I can fuck
without a condom on, I hope the only reason that I cope
Is 'cuz of that fact and I can bust in that, and that's why

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you more

I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, you silly hoe why must we try
Is it really so rough that we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs until the other begs
We're lying to ourself, that's the beauty of it, yeah
'Cuz we truly love each other, that's why we always fight
And all we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear, it ain't gonna change, this pinned up rage
We both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we both been someone else's someone else
The problem is neither one wants help, it's an addiction
And it can't be fixed, our family's mixed up
There's a baby sister in the mix and it hurts 'cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks he knows us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearing it all the time on every song
Every lyric and every rhyme, all the hoopla, all of the woopty woo
What you put me through, fuckin' woopty do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cuz this time girl i'm tellin you what
You do it again and i'm fuckin' you up 'cuz no matter 

What you say, what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'till I find you
No matter where you run, i'll be right there
Right behind you in your nightmares
So much for them flowers, and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you 'gon hate me more
When you find out you can't escape me, whore

The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's making me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Because you love me and I love you mor

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, Restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo

Brain size of a bread crumb, which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out, killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

I lace tunes, I'm out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'mma let your grandpa hit it, mix it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Bandage making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitz ya like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Ooh, this is good! Who sing this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic, living off liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix, set up by these white blue-collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music with a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin' records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe 'em somethin'
The fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here

You see I'm just Marshall Mathers 
I'm just a regular guy,
I don't know why all the fuss about me 
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,
All they did was doubt me 
Now everybody want to run they mouth
And take shots at me 

Yo, you might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead rottweiler dog
With it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin'
Or leanin' out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge thinkin' of Chris Wallace
Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that should of been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny Cartman 
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
With instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good-ol' fashioned
Passionate ass-whoopin' and gettin' your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy-girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you fagots in public
I'm a love it 

Vanilla Ice don't like me 
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me 
Then went and dyed his hair just like me 
A bunch of little kids want to swear just like me
And run around screamin', "I don't care, just bite me" 
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in fagots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves "Clowns" cause they look queer
Fagot you to Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away 
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' fagots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
 Ducked down and got paint balls shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' Mile Road, south of ten
And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females
In make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
"Slim Anus," you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming fagots!

'Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers 
I'm not a wrestler guy,
I'll knock you out if you talk about me 
Come and see me on the streets alone
If you assholes doubt me 
And if you want to run your mouth
Then come take your best shot at me 

Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blond mop that's on top
And this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a three sixty
Now these kids dis me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with M-C Get-Bizzy"
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter you fagot!
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass 
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got ninety-some cousins 
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on T-V
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Uh, here, double X-L, double X-L
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ah fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers 
I'm just a regular guy,
I don't know why all the fuss about me 
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,
All they did was doubt me 
Now everybody want to run they mouth
And take shots at me 

'Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers 
I'm just a regular guy,
I don't know why all the fuss about me 
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,
All they did was doubt me 
Now everybody want to run they mouth
And take shots at me 

Maxine!

Hello 
Can I speak to Maxine? 
Yeah this is me what's up? 
What up? 

Who dis? 
Denaun 
Yeah what's up? 
What are you doing? 

Nothing just laying in bed 
Huh? 
Nothing just laying in bed 
Why? 

I don't know thinking about something freaky to do 

I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine 
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean 
Plus she got a sugar daddy 
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly 

If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation 
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation 
When you step away son, she got her face done 
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if 

You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you 
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice 
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency 
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee 

Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it 
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it  

Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is 
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit 
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night 
You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down 

And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this 
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be 
You say you want to be with me, but how can you say that 
When you got niggas hiding in your closet 
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely 

I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me 
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies 
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas 
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number 

I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch.. 
Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga 
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands 
And said "Oh it's like that?" 

She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit 
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit 
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number 
She asked could I give her mine too 

Got to the crib and called her up 
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck 
I said "Maxine check this out, 
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out" 

Got to the crib she let me in 
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom 
I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things.
What the fuck are you doing?" 

So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing 
As she went for my midsection 
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt 
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work 

Before I hit it she said 
"3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass" 
I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok" 
She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS" 
I got up out 

Hey, Maxine 
What 
You thinking about sucking my dick? 
Yeah for a small price 

For a small price? What you mean? 
You know, money nigga 
You don't need no damn money, 
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit. 

What you, what you hear I got? 
AIDS 
Who told you that bullshit? 
My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie 

Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then 
Oh for real, it's like that? 
Well I ain't got shit, 
So he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me, 
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga 

Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you 
No, see.. 
You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you 
Hold on, why it ain't even like that 

I want ya'll to get paid, fucking

Oh, my goodness
What have I done 
I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world
In my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

Welcome to the slim shady mecca Rebbecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca

With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities why yes sir

Performed a home abortion with Dexter the ni yeser
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanging then digest her

All my west side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the teeth and showin' up

There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl don't front, oh no you didn't
I won right by the Pussy Cat Dolls "When call you kitten"
I'll pee on Rihanna see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room

The lazy boy so called fold her in two and sit on her
Imagine if visual for that man
Who woulda thought
Could ever be such a relentless prick
And leashin' his fingers
For the chicks who waltz
She looks like she outlived her life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be
Your so sensitive

I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and were does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball your all in
I said
I guess it's time for you to hate me again

Yeah 
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now 
But hey, what daddy always tell you? 
Straighten up little soldier 
Stiffen up that upper lip 
What you crying about? 
You got me 

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad 
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had 
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh 
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry 
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there? 
Daddy's with you in your prayers 
No more crying, wipe them tears 
Daddy's here, no more nightmares 
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it 
Laney uncles crazy, aint he? 
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it 
We're all we got in this world 
When it spins, when it swirls 
When it whirls, when it twirls 
Two little beautiful girls 
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze 
I know it's confusing you 
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news 
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems 
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me 
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see 
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did 
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me 
But things have gotten so bad between us 
I don't see us ever being together ever again 
Like we used to be when we was teenagers 
But then of course everything always happens for a reason 
I guess it was never meant to be 
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is 
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep 
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream 

 
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alrite
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, i told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night 
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why 
We fear how we feel inside 
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby 
But i promise momma's gon' be alright 

It's funny 
I remember back one year when daddy had no money 
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up 
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me 
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em 
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying 
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job 
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom 
And at the time every house that we lived in 
Either kept getting broke into and robbed 
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar 
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college 
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it 
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart 
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart 
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back 
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment 
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara 
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre 
And flew you and momma out to see me 
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me 
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it 
And you and Laney were to young to understand it 
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit 
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it 
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud 
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing 
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out 
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now 
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here 
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here 
I like the sound of that, yeah 
It's got a ring to it don't it? 
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment 

 
Now hush little baby don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alrite
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, i told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night 
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why 
We fear how we feel inside 
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby 
But i promise momma's gon' be alright 

And if you ask me too 
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird 
I'mma give you the world 
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you 
I'mma sing for you 
I'll do anything for you to see you smile 
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine 
I'mma break that birdies neck 
I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya 
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad 

Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
And like, back and forth because ah
This is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open
I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic 
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin' Fuck the World like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
Tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials 
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin' Fuck the World like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
Tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!

Somebody let me out this limousine 
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screamin' Fuck the World like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
Tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck

It doesnt take much
For me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You aint even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers
Like smearing blood stains with a paint brush
I cant explain what it is my brain does
But however it works its insane
Its plain nutz
And it aint just my brain thas dangerous
Its a whole combination of things
It takes nutz
And im not affriad to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
Im patiently waiting for the day
Im anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs

Ya drunk
Ya aint tough
Whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas
This is me talking motherfucker
This aint drugs
You wanna pop, shit wake-up, then make-up
FUCK THAT
Its too late chump now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does
Opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
Till i pull the paint off
I never been shot
But i think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
Cause ive always came off
Like ja's chain
When they try to rush him and lost
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
I dont stop
The only thing i wait for
Is day that i dont gotta report to probate court
Cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more
Cause ive been holding my tounge till i got a sprained jaw
Alot of rappers on my list that just aint ja
And ima read that motherfucker off from april
You pussies think i went soft since 8 mile
When i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls
Trust me

Monkey see monkey do
Dont ever make the first move
Just let em' come to you
Cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do
So let em' come to you
The rest of us follow suit
Monkey see monkey do

So bring it
Don't pick up the ball if you don't wanna play man
Its all fucked up now
The fuck im spose to do now?
Huh?
The fuck im spose to do?
Haha
Yo, we out

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation under God
Indivisible?
It feels so good to be back

I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel  re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'm a whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
Slash entrepreneur who has held onto few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure moving past that
Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back

Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors 

All the people up top on the side and the middle
Come together lets all form and swamp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home 

Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors 

Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryna tell us something,
Maybe this is god just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward,
That we have empowered
This is bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six

Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Queda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an Ak-forty seven, let him go, fight his own war
Let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes its all lies
The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight you know why,
'Cause I told you to fight.

Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors 

And as we proceed,
To Mosh through this desert storm,
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And Mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator?
Do you guy's hear us? hear us? 

Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers, can you hear my voice?
Okay, he's not responding
I'm gonna need an eighteen-gauge
Left A-C right away

B-P is ninety over twelve
Respiration's at eight
Okay, I'm tubing him

D-M-C, this is medic forty-one

Medic forty-one, this is D-M-C base, go ahead

He's cold
Spike him back and grab the back board

Okay, got it
On three
One, two, three
Let's move

Detroit, Motown
Hey guess what, they gave us the  this year, and you know what happened?

Robbin', shootin', killin', murder 
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder 

Hennied up, ginnied up, ski mask, black truck
Dickey outfit, pa**enger side 
F*** it I just did two lines, a chrome tech nine, it'll tear out n****z spines
It's a party, go on in and have fun, 'cause after it's over
All you gon' hear is *gunshot* run n**** run n****
Shootin', blastin', hittin' the floor
Ten-thousand in the safe, s*** I'm 'bout to score
Cause I'm dangerous, off angeldust, s*** I'll bust
Even the n**** that came with us
And this is for my n****'s that be robbin' and stealin'
Carjackin', murder one's, and f***in' drug dealin'!

Robbin', shootin', killin', murder 
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder 

I stumble in the club blowed up, nine millimeter c***ed
Something's telling me to stop, f*** it I don't see the cops
N****'s don't believe until they see it's out
Stupid motherf***ers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
B****es scream like I pulled my penis out
Beggin' me to put that big motherf***er away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that
Come out of them diamonds and you come out of that velor
The party is over, shut the f*** down, cut the music
Matter of fact turn it back up s*** I could use it 
I need the noise in case I have to let a couple off
Saw another icey chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that butter soft, and since you buyin' out the bar
You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow
I'm out for the paper, my homie better hide the jewels
I'm in the game starvin', and I ain't playin' buy the rules n****

Robbin', shootin', killin', murder 
Robbin', shootin', killin', murder 
Sh-sh-sh-shaaaaaady!

"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!

"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!

Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's yo' life span
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets ya description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed, the best thing
Would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' the Mac
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin' "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' Ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin' a vest

"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!

Left the house, pullin' out the drive backin' out
We were backin' out this lady's Jag started blackin' out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut ya yakkin' mouth,
'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin' fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl on "Set it Off" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', "Son, go in and call the police
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo sixty four
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year old lady with groceries
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin' "truce truce!"
 Surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me!
It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps

"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!

"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate"
"All I see is blood and murder, my mind state"
Murder murder murder, and kill kill kill!

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault

I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan - an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin
who love booze and alternative music 
Told me she was goin back into usin again 
I said, 'Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here' *knocks on the door*
Who's in the den?'
 It's me and Kelly!
 My bad,  let's try another room
 I don't trust you!
 Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods
 Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party is so drab
 Oh dag!!
 What?
 I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!
 Huh?!

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault 

 Yo Sue!
 Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's tripping..
 I need to go puke!! 
 I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said,
 Help me I think I'm havin a seisure!
I said, 'I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin my t-shirt' 
'Would you calm down you're startin to scare me'
She said,
'I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook'
 I'm over here Sue,  you're talkin to the plant, look!
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault 

 Wait! Where you goin? You better be careful
 Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these
'John, where's Dave at before I bash you?'
 He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!
'Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left
of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?'
 Well it depends on how may you had
'I took three, she ate the other twenty-two caps
Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, drinkin Lysol'
 She's gonna die dude
'I know and it's my fault!'
 My god!!!

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world 
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault 

My God, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!
Please! Please wake up!! What are you doing?!
You're not dead!! You're NOT dead!
I know you're not dead! Oh my God!
Susan wake up! Oh God...

Yo, yeah girl,
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you?

You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep
Round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows are so sweet
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with Jon Benet Ramsey
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep 
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me 
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me 
If you call, I'll come, I will answer 
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep 
I hear my music box, playing a song for me 
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me 
Won't you be my private little dancer 

I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep 
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me 
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me 
If you call, I'll come, I will answer 
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep 
I hear my music box, playing a song for me 
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me 
Won't you be my private little dancer 

I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippin's,
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above,
Forced and treat 'em all ? stingy I've become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
With the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera
Stand back, cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep 
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me 
And when we're world's apart, you mean the world to me 
If you call, I'll come, I will answer 
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep 
I hear my music box, playing a song for me 
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me 
Won't you be my private little dancer 

Yea, , yea yea, oh

I feel like dancing
I feel like dancing

I smell something in the air that's making me 
I said I smell something in the air that's making me high

Ok here we go, do-re-mi-fa-so, I'm so la-di-da so
Lyrical rise flow, give back the tobasco
You motherfuckers mustsanot know the tic tac songs
Time to show you the mo kick ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick axe a sick asshole
She tac toe frozen six pack with exacto
Knives, strangling wives with pig lasso
Few bags of the the grass, zig zags, I'm with the doc so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison, the boys and girls who do not know
You do not want to try this at home my novato 
This is niether the time or the place to get macho
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn, and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, tho what you thought though
Bout time to you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke

It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind

It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind

Your dreams of getting the pill, you are literally getting the chills
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still, I'm admitting, I'm beginning to feel
Like I don't think anyone's real,
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dali Llama and become a bin gramma a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me mama, you lookin sexy mama,
Don't know if this the lala or the rum and pepsi mama
Don't want to end up inside my refrigerator freezer,
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know can name every serial killer who ever existed in a row,
Put em in chronological order beginning with Jack the Ripper,
Name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper,
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped,
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model the make the plate
And which motel which lake they found her in,
And how they attacked the victim,
Say which murder weapon was used to do what and which one,
Which night it was done, what kid would write there was none,
So sloppy like this it's fun, the fuckin ecstasy goes

It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind

When I'm behind a mic dynamite is what it's kinda like
Get stuck with that same stick that you're trying to light
Behind the boards is Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup sign for your symptoms
Heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some,
He can give her some, she can give him some
Get behind a lynn drum, make up a beat and kill the sucka syndrome
You're spitting drama when it comes to lyrics and penance I'm
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the end ending up
Capable of bringing a bullets a stillunbelievable bullets a
Titanium brain that's full of, surprises
When the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos eyes
Good evening, this ain't even a weed thing,
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drink anything

It must be the ganja
It's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me while I'm so high
Maybe it's the hindi that has gotten in me
Whatever's gotten into me I don't mind

Oh! Yeah,
So much for 1st single on this one

Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of 'erp
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Butterworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-On-Christopher-Reeves-Just-For-No-Reason
Other than to just tease him
'Cause he was his biggest  fan
He used to be Superman
Now I'm pourin' liquor on the curb in his name for him
"Eminem you wait til we meet up again
Fucker I'm kicking your ass for everything you've ever said"
It goes one for the money two for the fuckin' show
Ready get set let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers I told ya
I'm about to blow so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers it's dominoes
I'm on a roll, around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where the Eminem Show left off but I know
Anything's possible though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder, I'm like O-J
He's like my Cochran today
We keep them Mark Ferman tapes in a safe
Lock em away
Better watch what you say just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua Gosh
I wish I could of told you not to do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

And this was supposed to be my first single 
But I just fucked that off so
Fuck it let's all have fun, let's mingle 
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle 
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh no
Oh ah oh ah oh ah
Oh oh ah ah
Oh ah oh ah oh ah
Poo poo ka ka

Eri-eri-Erick swallowed some generic
Sleeping pills, and woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned sixteen and used a fake I-D
To sneak in V-I-P to see are Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee
To be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled they cherish every picture
With their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hicky-dickory dirk diggler look at me work wizardry
With these words, am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or  jerkin your chain
Twenty two jerks in a jerk circle
Or is it a circle jerk
Or wait a minute what am I saying?
Allow me to run it back and rewind it
Wait let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin your chain
Am I berserk or insane
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs
Working the dang cameras
Filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Porno's who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered Britney and Justin
Video tapes of em fuckin'
When they was just Musketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club and dusted em
And went straight to The Source with em
Cause they could have sworn someone said ni-
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it
You can hear the ga-uh
And then come ta
Find out it was Justin
Sayin' "I'm gon-na cum!"
And this was supposed to be

Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics
I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800 I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre
Wake up gay and make up with Ray
Hey! So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big a big cock
Or suck a dick and lick a dick and eat a dick and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done you can fuck off
Fuck a fuck off

Balls, Balls, Balls
Balls, Balls, Balls
You'll never touch my

Catch me if you can but you ain't man enough
You're standin' tough
But you know that no matter what
You'll never get the chance to touch
My Balls, Balls, Balls
Balls, Balls, Balls
You'll never touch my balls

I see you ain't a playa, you ain't ballin'
And I don't even care who the hell you call in
In this game, it ain't no talkin'
You can get it started, I nail the coffin
And all I here is "get your man up off him"
So why I gotta stop it, this nigga was talkin'
And I ain't gotta prove you nothin'
I do it and you ain't gotta push my buttons

This dude in front of me, he weighs a brick
He's quick and I can't get Marshall hit
So I played my position and don't make a move
Been doin' this for years, my team can't lose
And ain't nobody, ain't nobody hard
9 o'clock, I'm gonna punch me hard
Hut one, hut two, I'm ready
Hike, give the ball to Nelly
And nobody out there feels me
Take this 'fore you have to kill me
And any player in my way, I'm foldin'
Damn it, call holton

Football, Football, I love football
Yes, tres, dos, uno
Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole son of a bitch
Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle
I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole
Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek
Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak
Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly
That didn't work, try another play
Hut one, hut two, hut hut hurry up
And reach up another grown man's butt
Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre
But Jesus yikes, I think I can feel his balls
My dick is long as it is hard, yeah so are my balls
It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus
Run it back, wrong song, yeah disreguard
That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on?
On 5 and our timeouts are gone
Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball 
To the sideline to Von, he steps outta bounds
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
Call another huddle, we're down by six
The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift
But he's so god damn high, that he's trips
Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips
And runs the ball all the way down to the one
But he don't get in, but all we need is a put 
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten
God dammit I'ma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again
Everybody's laughin' now, no timeouts and its now fourth down
We're never gonna make it, wait I just got an idea
Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long
I'ma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you wit no pants on
Ass out with a floppin' schlong, touch down yeah I told ya
It's the longest yard

The new face on the yard, just hand me the ball 
I'ma run through all of ya'll, ya'll just soft
Even though my cleats is kickin' up mud
It's more tragic for me, I'm stiff armin' punks
High steppin' through the end zone
I been grown, I'm so dirty you don't even know my skin tone
It's time to rumble, no time to fumble
And I won't stumble, your frontline will tumble
Playin' ball with killas, my team's gorillas
Three time offenders, even drug dealers
One of the best runnin' backs there never was
Movin' like Barry Sanders, leavin' you in the dust

Yack is high, I got the highest yack
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snaps like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eyin' my eye, the back tryin to sack us
No matter how big they flyin' backwards
Wide receiver, recievin' wide
For every stride in my life, I breathe and die

Defense is playin' a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excel
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare, I gave the ball a stare
And use my lineman's shoulder as a chair
Now I'm flyin' through the air like a superhero
I can use this pose for a box of cereal
I'm no joke punk, I get my dinerio
For bein' the best player on my team what
As soon as I hear the hut 1, 2, hut
I do one run, run, the screen go run run
Then I cut, spin around in the endzone
Then I do the ninety shuffle so

Footballs, I'm talkin' about footballs

I don't know dude
I think everyone's all jealous and shit 'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
"Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady.
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby"
They're all like "Oh my God it's him"
"Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem"
"I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock"
"Please Marshall please let me suck your cock"
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cuz they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
Roxanne
My band
My band

You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
Hey dad how come we don't rap on Protools
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no I'm Swift 
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'Cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intect, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin jacks whilin' get whipped on my back

Look at Em little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
Yeah I know man find himself takin on a flick
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
No I had an interview not you two
You gonna be late for soundcheck
Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
But our mics are screwed up and his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin
Hey yo Em
You got somethin' to say?!
Man no
I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up
Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
When I was bout to talk right after you
I swear, I swear man

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement park
I'm gonna let the world know that proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the musics starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear 
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get ten percent
And these guys they can find every area code

Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way

Goddammit I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artist slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video I was in the back
Superman video I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us the questions
Like who's D12, how we get started

Bitch are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute 
50 told me to do situps to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

Girl why cant you see your the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
Cuz once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band
My band

The hottest boy band in the world
D12!
I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girl's to take off their
Underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girl's wan to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wan to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa

Daddy what are you doing?
Okay then!
Everybody listen up!
I'm goin' to hell!
Who's comin' with me?
Somebody please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy

There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high,
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you,
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls, I cut'em off,
And got'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar inside of a hall
With my framed autographed sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall,
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off .
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off.
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
Hailie, tell 'em baby,
My Dad's Lost It!

There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy

It's like my mother always told me and codeine and
Goddammit you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Uh, fuck that shit bitch eat a motherfuckin' dick,
Chew on a prick and lick
A million mutherfuckin' cocks per second,
I'd rather put out a mutherfuckin' Gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy whipped bitch, eat pussy,
And have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo. Can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go, eenee, meenee, meini, mo,
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?
Dad

There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise at the same time,
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
See what you're seein' is a genius at work, which to me isn't work,
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek,
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on,
And kicked and hit with shit every time
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on.
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave,
Screamin' at the sky, 'til clouds gather, it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it, the parents are pissed but the kids love it.
Nine millimeter heater stashed in two seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em baby
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy

Crazy
Ha ha ha
You're funny daddy!

Ya look

If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
Cause your just dyeing to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' bout' Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition I mean right
Nope, Paul Wall is dope and so's Bubba
But, but, But....
But I don't compete wit nobody
I just go hard do the rope a dope ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents do donuts
Sometimes I play possum like I'm asleep it's awesome!
I'm like a sleeping giant and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta no where and bite prey
And sink my teeth in and fill em' full a poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill em'
And let em' know I just don't feel em'
And smack em' with the backward E the' Eminem emblem
I was taught if your gonna murder somebody you should face em'
Tell em' why look em' dead in the eye then waste em'
And the dark shall emerge from the firey depths of hell
And swallow the shallow the hallow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell there souls
For this rap game and it goes

123 check,check 123, check 123
That aint the hook now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say
My public adores me!
Everybody bores me they just so corny
So at night before I sleep I look in the mirror
The mirror glows lips and it whispers come nearer

My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I can not have you then no one can your my darling

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault 

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault 

I went to Johns rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blond babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan an ex heroin addict who just stopped using
She loved booze and alternative music
Told me she was going back to using again
I said wait first try this hallucinogen
Its better then heroin and booze and gin
Come here lets go in here
Who's in the den? 
My bad lets try another room 
Shut up slut chew up this mushroom
This will help you get in touch with your roots
Walking barefoot butt naked and run in the woods

Oh dag I didn't mean for you to eat the whole bag 

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault 

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault 

Yo Sue 
Oh shoot she's tripping 
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susie stop crying I don't hate ya
The world is not against you
I am sorry your father raped you
So you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth
That ain't no reason to start wiggin' and spaz out
She said 
I said I am high too bitch
Quit grabbing my t-shirt 
Would you calm down you are starting to scare me
She said (I am 26 years old and I am not married I don't even have any
Kids and I can't cook)
I am over here Sue
You are talking to the plant
Look we need to get to a hospital
Before it is too late
'Cause I never seen one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault 

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault 

Susie where you going you better be careful

I am not your dad
And try not to swallow your tongue
Want some gum?
Put down the scissors before you do something dumb
I will be right back just chill baby please?
I got to go find Dave he is the one who gave me these
John where's Dave at before I bash you
He's in the bathroom
I think he is taking a crap dude
Dave pull up your pants
We need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants
Chopping her hair off
And there's only two days left of spring break
How long do these things take to wear off?
Well it depends on how may you've had
I took 3 she had the other 22 caps
Now she is upstairs crying out her eye balls
Drinking Lysol 
I know and its my fault 

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault 

I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now its my fault 

I am so sorry I am so sorry
Susie please wake up
What are you doing
Your not dead

My mom loves Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom, my mom,
I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
Oho whoa-ho,
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on val-i-um.
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank
Fucking peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So everyday I have at least three stomach aches
Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fucking-chiever
My teacher didn't think I was going to be nothing either
What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?
Misses Mathers your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the mother fucker's been puffin' reefer
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither,
I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a tea-cup? Bitch you ain't my keeper
I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone
I ain't playin' go find you a white crayon
And color a fuckin' zebra

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
You ate it yesterday I ain't hear no complaints did I?
Now here's a plate full of painkillers
Now just wait til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
Ya little mother fucker,
I'll make ya sit there
And make that retarded fuckin' face without even tastin' it
You better lick the fuckin' plate, you ain't wastin' it
Put ya face in it before I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't givin' in you're gonna
Just sit there in one fuckin' place spinnin' in
Until next Thanksgiving'
And if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit you want to sit there and play innocent
A rack fell and hit me at K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did? it's none of your dang business kid.

My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

My mom loved Valium now all I am is a party-animal
I am what I am but I'm strong to be finished with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't want to swallow it without chewing it
I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it
My Valium, my Valium
Man I never thought that I could ever be a drug addict
Nah fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
A tragedy from fucking passin it up got to me
And it's probably were I got acquainted with the taste ain't it
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom beautiful
She killed the fucking dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fucking Aspirin and say that it has a headache
Here, want a snack?
You hungry you fucking brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax.
Take it and take a nap, eat it,
But I don't need it.
Then fuck it then break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
Alright ma, you win I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it gobble it and start wobblin'
Stumble hobble tumble slip drip
Then I fall in bed with a bottle of meds
And a Heath Ledger bobblehead

My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
Whattup X?

I float like big spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby
if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me
to do war, and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out
With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now

Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets
Let's see who want to die the same time as me
and make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?
I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now

I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain
I don't want to hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name

Why do you hate me?  I came from nothin
Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me?  You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit  I struggle for survival
And now you tryin to act like my rival?
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
all the pain  all the agony 
All the horror  all the tragedy 
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life?  One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the FUCK?!  you think you talkin to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!

I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I "Square Dance" cause I'm sick of rappin circles
around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - see'mon
 No gangsta you ain't either
 But I know that I spit "Ether"
 I shoulda crossed your belly
 Show you I'm not R. Kelly
X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man.. {*scratched* - "Watch your fuckin mouth"}

For the last time man, I'm through

For one second My name is 

Hi kids! Do you like violence? 
Wanna see me stick Nine inch Nails, through each one of my eyelids? 
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? 
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? 
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate 
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a base-head!" Uh-uh!
"So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass, faster than a fat bitch
Who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! 
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers 
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me "Let's just be friends!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do 
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her 
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans 
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph 
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!"

Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! 
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die 
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
 Am I comin' or goin'?
I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka,
Dare me to drive?  all my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide
 Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks 
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head 
I'm steamin' mad  And by the way when you see my dad? 
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

Hi! My name is

This motherfucker here, just won't shut up will you? 
Talk about I owe you, bitch you owe me 
I'm promoting you right now
Man lets put the nail in his coffin 

I don't wanna be like this 
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings 
But I'm only bein real when I say nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap 
Old men have heart attacks 
and I don't want to be responsible for that so 
Put the mic down and walk away 
You can still have a little bit of dignity 

I would never claim to be no, Ray Benzino, 
an 83 year old fake Pachino, 
So how can he hold me over some balcony 
without throwin' his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me, 
Please don't, you'll probably fall with me 
and our asses will both be history, 
But then again you'll finally get your wish,
cuz you'll be all over the street like 50 Cent 
Fuckin punk pussy fuck you chump 
gimme a one-on-one see if I dont fuck you up 
Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up 
And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck 
dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin 
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin' 
and beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances 
and you can even get the clearances cuz real lyricists 
don't even respect you or take you serious 
It's not that we don't like you, we hate you - period 
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn 
last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand 
Now hes a busta? What the fucks with that? 
Get on a track dissin' us kissin' 50's ass 
and askin' me what I know about inditements-bite me 
bitch I got two cases, and probation - fight me! 
What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man 
ready to take whatever sentence he hands 
What you know about your wife slicin her wrists 
right in front of the only thing you have in this world - a little girl? 
And I put that on her, when this is all over 
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her 
I don't know shit about no shoppin rocks 
But what you know about hip-hop shops rockin' spots? 
When your the only white boy in that bitch just rippin 
pressin' up your own flyers and your stickers stickin 
them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinkos 
Just makin' copys of your covers of cassette singles 
and sell them out the trunk of your Tracer 
Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers 
What you know about bein' bullied over half your life? 
Oh that's right, you should know what that's like, your half white 
Vanilla Ice,spill the beans and rice, I'm eaten you alive inside 
Jesus Christ, if you're that much of a gangster, put the mic down 
You should be out killin motherfuckers right now 
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill'em dead bitch 
Shoot'em in the fuckin' head, go ahead bitch 
Slap my mom, slap the fuck outta her! 
She can't sue you, she wouldnt get a buck out of you 
Cuz your broke as fuck you suck your a fuckin' joke 
If you was really sellin coke, well then what the fuck 
you stop for dummy? If you slew some crack 
you'd make alot more money than you do from rap 
You never had no security, you'll never be famous 
You'll never now what its like to be rich, lifes a bitch aint it? 
Raymond, here, let me break this shit down in lamens 
terms for you just to make sure that you can understand this 
and Canibus they usin too many complicated fuckin words for you 
Here then let me slow it down for you 
so you can understand if I say it slower: 
Let it go dawg it's over 

Haha 
Talkin' bout I have motherfuckers callin' your crib 
bitch you ain't even got a fuckin' crib 
You ain't even got a fuckin' phone, fuckin' Bum
Threatened to shut me down at your little fuckin' Source magazine 
if I come back then you would attack me, bitch you attacked me first 
take it like a man and shut the fuck up 
and fuck your little magazine too 
I don't need your fuckin' magazine, I got Double X L's number anywayz 
And yall cant stand it cuz there gettin' bigger than yall 
oh, and by the way, how'd I look on the V-M-A's? 
When you was watchin' me from whatever fuckin TV you was watchin' me from in Boston 
The mean streets of Boston, fuckin' sissy 
Like you got us scared in the motherfucker, suck our motherfuckin' dicks 
Oh, and for those thats dont know, dont get it twisted yo', the Source has a white owner

You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile, as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire 'cause I'd rather believe a lie
Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in
Goin' to bed mad, I keep on tryin' to make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die ever should I
Leave you for good so never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you, what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'm 

Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Hey what up man?
What up god?
Ya heard?
Chillen, cold as hell
Yes it is, hey Busta didn't come here did he?
No, hey look, you got fifteen cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store alright man quick cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look..
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar know what I mean..
Just throw it in there they ain't gonna know
You know what look, I'm sick of taking this damn bus everywhere man
You gotta make some moves or something
I know look, I'm trying to get rich, 
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car, 
you know what I'm saying?
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something, 
you know what I'm saying? Cause I'm tired of being broke

Verse 1:
Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
Cause man I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see
I'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me, but if you disagree
You missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a mission less course
When shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star

Chorus:
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh

You know what I'm saying, see what I'm talking about man? 
Cause that's it
Yeah 
A million dollars ain't even that far away man
Yo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life
Yeah I hear what your saying, 
look there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying?
I can't live like this for the rest of my life man, 
bumming rides everywhere I go
Yeah, what's up with Lexus' and Land cruisers'?

Verse 2:
Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose
The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot
The 5 Elemantz for life my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time
My crews true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man planning what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star

Chorus:
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh

That's what I'm talking about, I'm not trying to be the player, 
I'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be President
Yo forgot that President man I'm trying to be king, 
making dead presidents, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah
Getting money anytime I want owning my own businesses and all that, 
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I'm trying to be a millionare man, hahaha, but don't all you know
You only live once 
ninety six baby

There's not much you could do or say to phase me 
People think I'm a little bit crazy 
I get it from all angles in a while to save me 
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things 
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think 
A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me 
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me 
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy 
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times 
Cause I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast 'cause my mind is racing 
And I could give a fuck what category you place me 
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone 
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats 
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z 
For every single die hard fan who embraced me 
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me 
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me 
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me 
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me 
It only made me what I am today, see 
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me 
You ain't gonna make or break me 
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G 
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening 
Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me 
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me 
You had all this time to think about it 
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me 
Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day 
That we finally meet in the same place to see 

 
No matter how many battles I been in and won 
No matter how many magazines on my nuts 
No matter how many M-C's I end up 
Ooh ooh, it's never enough 

My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it 
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics 
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split 
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it 
The spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit 
Graze it, your peace talk, save it 
You shit sounds dated, you're overrated 
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers 
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse 
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy? 
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it 
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic 
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it 
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag of the chocolate 
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it 
When it's hot, it's hot 
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it 

I got 50 Cent
I got G-Unit
D-Twizzyin this bitch
With Obie Triiiiice
So watch what you say
Before you call our name
If you say one more thing
It won't be nice

Here we go
I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later
You little haters are too jellous of us to love us
You ain't it
G-Unit made it
And Obie's comin
D-Twizzy's comin
You sick to your stomach
50% is 50-Cent
The other 50% is who's color skin it is
Don't even consider takin our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't tryin to get too intriqette into it
I'm just tryin to give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cuz then it's gunna get to the point where it escalates into some other shit
Then Im a flip
Then Im a get to stompin in my Air Force One's
Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's gunna feel like there's so many feet kickin you
You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussy's try to push me
Thinkin they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
Ya'll tickle me pink
I think I'd just rather have pink tiggle me
Hickory dickory dock tickoty tock tickety a little bit of the diggity dock diggity
Mixed with a little bit of the jigga-ja-jigga
With a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggity

CHORUS:
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cuz we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records, we the label fa sho
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
We gon' fuck around and steal your people
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records, we the label fa sho

Shady in the place to be seen
And I got what it takes to rock the mic RIGHT!
Still watch what you say to me punk cuz I'm off probation in less then 6 MONTHS!
HA HA WHOO
Shady Records
Still Aftermath
And don't thik we dont hear you mutha fucka's talkin
We see ya'll
But we just gon' sit back for a minute and watch what the fuck ya'll do

In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed,
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are six critics
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling an' I am not felling
You fuckers are not ready, 'cause I got jelly, like  pot belly
This is destiny, yes money I'm of running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
I can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me
No apologies

My head hit's the pillow, a weeping willow, I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow, hand's on my head, touched knees to elbow
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over, these cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough, so keep playing it and stand next to the subs
I choke mic's like asphyxiation when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'
Fuck yeah I'm a basketcase and I mastered this rap shit, 'til my ass gets wasted,
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation
Fourty four mags a fascination, a taste for disaster and if that's the case then

No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny
I can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me
No apologies

This song isn't for you, it's for me, a true MC
It's what it do just to see if he still has it
And if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a real MC
Got you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly
You still agree, as long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't have this outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an' mourning
So I'm warning you, don't coax me
It's silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be fooled
The press blows up this whole thing, it's stupid
They don't know 'cause they don't see that I'm wounded
All they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'
An' they can suck my dick while I'm pukin', an' you too, you can

Expect no sympathy from me I'm an MC
This is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies

Expect no sympathy from me I'm an MC
This is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies

Love, love
Love, love,
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
Young Money yeah uh

Ah, throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing about her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles uh
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay them down, make them beg
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on a triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes, uh
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in a cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost,
No love found

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now 
You kicked me when I was down, but what you say, just 
That's right  I don need you 
Don't wanna see you 
Ha bitch you get  You showed me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around 

That's right  and I don't need you 
Don't want to see you, 
Ha bitch you get no love
No love
No love
No love, ha
Bitch you get no love
No love
No love, and I don't need you 
Get 'em

I'm alive again
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life I can
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen,
I'm a little bit sicker than most,
Shit's gonna get thick again, they say the
Competition is stiff, but I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom,
Look at these rappers, how I treat them so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em yeah
They call me a freak 'cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute,
Yeah that rap was tight, but I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump in the place
All the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game I so started
To rock fellow, when I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted 'cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop, I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop, 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it 'cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick 'cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride,
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent is getting no
Mercy, mark my words, ain't letting up, relentless I smell blood,
I don't give a fuck, keep giving them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now 
You kicked me when I was down, but what you say, just 
Yeah that's right  And I don need you 
Don't wanna see you 
Ha bitch you get  You showed me nothing but hate 
You ran me into the ground, but what comes around goes around
 That's right  and I don't need you 
Don't want to see you, 
Ha bitch you get no love
No love
No love
No love, ha
Bitch you get no love
No love
No love, and I don't need you 
Ha, bitch you get no 

You know the days of talking is over
And there ain't too much more we can say
To try to get these different individuals,
or muthaf***as as I like to call 'em
To just, shut the f*** up
Let's go

You witnessed the a** whooping, bones got broke 
When the fifty calib blast, wouldn't last
Through the smoke as you choke
Pay attention bear witness to this muthaf***in' twitch that you excite 
Cause none of the bullets hit you they missed you,
But we ain't trippin' wasn't after you, 
Don't you piss, it's like a b**** them ni66az laughed at you
Now you agitated a little bit, acting just like a little b****
I figured that you would surface I knew you happen to managed to pop s***
Saying Trick that, Trick this
When the balls that you have and if when I pop them
Should of died wit 'em, body and soul coulda burn 
I'm a keep killing these b****es until everybody learn
F*** time and it's time that these f***ers to start dyin'
I ain't sayin this to say in this rhyme and I ain't lyin
Man enough to say it and mean it, ni66az can be gone
I'm a do another verse but there ain't much more I can speak on

There's nothing more these words can say
This hard headed muthaf***a just won't let it lay
So say a prayer for this playa' cause he's going to his grave
So stand clear b****es betta' get the f*** out my way.

Let me show you how I started as a starvin' artist
This is Proof wit the truth regardless of all this
As my C-E-O and best friend of the essence
I won' why nobody in Detroit won't test him
Lesson learned, flesh get burned
Tex in turn, a scar hotter than the press and burn
Everlast the beef is over, you can sleep this over
Clique Benz took the streets wit soldiers
Including me I move and creep wit Uzi fleas that choose to lead
I'll put your dudes to sleep
Who is he  Trick no treat
That street life A-K that still'll lift your feet
The rest of these n****s is comical
I'm a go abdominal, split like a domino
Rhyming pro, sharp without a diamond, Go
Geronimo to any man wit pause
Murder you b****es, still screaming f*** the law!

There's nothing more these words can say
This hard headed muthaf***a just won't let it lay
So say a prayer for this playa' cause he's going to his grave
So stand clear b****es betta' get the f*** out my way.

Yeah...ha ha ha , Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha

No one's iller than me 
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313...

I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meanin' 
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret
That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!

It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh!

Me and Eminem and Mike
Drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route 
Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell "EVERYBODY GET OUT"!
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
Cuz she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece

No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

Nobody better test me, cuz I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters

Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads
Flashin' bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' "Stop it..."
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick
Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggaz still don't know the top pick?
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks bitch!
We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits

Ain't nobody iller than me

It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees!
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast...

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid 
To take a stand, it's been a ride
Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid 
To take a stand 
Everybody 
Come take my hand come 
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid 
To take a stand 
Everybody 
Come take my hand come 
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now 

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not

I'm not afraid 
To take a stand 
Everybody 
Come take my hand come 
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Ashes blowin' in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

I feel sorry for this beat, symphony pains for this track
This road is taking me back, down memory lane with this rap
I could still look out in this crowd, be wild and be takin' aback 
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere, and fast
Another terrorist attacks, like a tariff
Blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish, in the blast but that isn't scaring us
We pass knowing we're fearless
'Cause we're just

Ashes blowin' in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up
Goin' nowhere
We're on the ride of our lives
We're goin' nowhere fast

Fuck doing what you're told, act like a two year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom, and blow anyways
For MC's, it's a funeral
But I'm devising this rhyme, 'cause I am awake in your mourning
That's why I rise and I shine, like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto guts bravado, nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I must've got you in somewhat of a debacle
Plus some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothing, although
There's a lot off shit I said in jest, that's though to swallow
But if at times, my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves, speed of light, avoid it, veer or just steer towards it
We're only looking forward, but where we're going
We have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical 
It's getting warm in here, I set the world on fire
I was born to be an arsonist, just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch
War machine, but you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have something for your ear
And in the course of the assault this torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blue to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten tonne nuke like Kim Jung Un
And end up ruining your career
Moving on, this is said and done
And at the end of my run, I'll just rewind clocks
Forever young, make time stop
Will I ever fall off? That day'll never come
To the pine box, bitch fuck you!
I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But, I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just

Ashes blowin' in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up
Goin' nowhere
We're on the ride of our lives
We're goin' nowhere fast

You can't tell us nothing, hardheaded and we're stubborn
So, working out the other when we're young

Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter, uh oh
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is

Ashes blowin' in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back, and we're never getting old
'Cause the skies are black, but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

'Cause we're goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up, goin' up
Goin' up
Goin' nowhere
We're on the ride of our lives
We're goin' nowhere fast

	What? Uhh..
	The Bad..
	Yeah..
	The Evil..
 Right, yo
	put em together

 Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothin' to strip
	If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothin' to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothin' to chew
 Yo..
	I'm just fuckin' with you, cause I got nothin' to do

I am bored!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors d'oeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers *crash sound*
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm rippin' your wallet off 

And slippin a Molotov in your Cocktail 
Burnin your contracts, punch your A&R in the face *punch sound*
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missin' I took it 

Nurse look at this straight jacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail 
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head 
when the rest of his body's still alive runnin'

Comin' with five gunmen, waitin' to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500  hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhymin' about birds
only about two-thirds'd really set it without words

Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's rainin' slugs 
I'm the hottest shit in the industry 
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defendin' me

You lack class and respect, get a direct back blast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit will end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up 

I take it if you run your mouth, then you want to get sent up
Heat it up, you be leakin' blood and spittin' phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible

Forget a chorus...  my metaphors are so complicated 
it takes six minutes to get applause 
And by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career 
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothin' to fall back on!

I'll throw you off of ten floors...
Pull a fuckin' headache outta my head, and put it in yours 
I'm indoors, waitin' for disaster to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores

This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, "It oughta happen.
You swallow cum bitch?" "No, but I brought a napkin"
Gettin' skullie while I'm autographin'
Got my daughter laughin' cause I sent her mother whitewater raftin'

I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my you-haul screamin', 
"Wait, wait, wait.. you ain't movin' here!"
Lorena Bobbitt, Come here, want a souveneir?

I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference -- I need some 'caine 
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
 Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

Walkin' in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places 

Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icin' my fame, blowin' your hand off
Dancin' with the Devil leadin - I won't die, I'm never leavin' 
I pledge allegiance to forever breathin'

Street niggaz with nuts, what? My meat's bigger 
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
with a deathwish, thinkin I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace

For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil 
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

	
The Bad... the Evil...
The Bad... the Evil...

No matter what people say
I'm gon keep rappin' this way
No matter what you may think
I'm gon keep doin' my thing

I'm almost as famous as fat bald men
Decided to write songs to teach mouseketeers to sing
I stick britney spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck 
Causing terror to christina aguilera
When i grab her by the hair and drag her across the sahara
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
Got a habit of holding tylenol in his hands
Til it melts in his fuckin' palms and dissolves in his glands
 the fool who visit the playground
Wit' two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pistol whipped wit a mauseburg
Wit' a pistol grip and fed pitbulls shit
Sniff glue sticks like i give two shits
If i get too rich, i just get sued

Yo, i leave wit no injure, after i blow four in ya
One handstand on top of yo' ninja
Crash it,  doc stir the madness
Til why'all outta work like tony atlas
Walkin' cans in the laundry basket
America's most with the army after us
Fuck flossin' we take what's yours
A low fifteen like a ace in four
I'm outta work, but doc laid them off
 the tape is off
Yo, you targeted from arsonists
Papermate pens filled wit arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what prada is
Doc could shape up, touch your barber miss
Betty you wit a bloody blade
I turn rap camps into crystal lake
Fuck bitches face is what i'ma do
'cause that what white boy tano do

So how is everybody doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
'cause uh, we gettin' down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if why'all don't want to bump to this... off the wall!!

Yo, so how is everybody feelin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get rude and ill in a fight
'cause uh, we gettin' down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't want to bump... off the wall!!

No matter what people say
I'm gon keep rappin' this way
No matter what you may think
I'm gon keep doin' my thing

Yo, you could buy jaz spittin', hospital, son admit it
Rip your lips off, kiss my ass wit it
Slap bitches, got marshall mathers 
Weed, x, and the acid tabs did it
I was happenin wit no rerun
Like rob deniro when the +heat+ come
My barrel hang out the camaro
Aimed at the nose of them hoes it's hard to breathe from
Flash the gat, your town, bogardin'
Yo' wallet, your chain the main target
Beef is like cold engine, don't start it
Bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot
We clowned you, rap surround sounds around you
From ten speed and brown shoe
Doc and eminem, cock the m & m
Blood flows with 2pacalypse and them

It's like, funk doctor meets the punk rocker
Got the drugs stopped inside the lunch box 
Pop junk like i just got jumped
Popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good, thank god for vodka
'cause wit my luck, i'll probably get shot by a stalker
Probably got a fanatic waitin upstairs in the attic
Wit a automatic callin' me up there
My man stan wit a gat in his hand
Stakin my house out in a tan tinted sedan
He pull your mouth out til you can't finish a damn
Ham sandwich, or your can spinach and spam
Til you gotta sip through a straw, shoplift through the mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey ma, maybe i'll give you a call
Sike you fuckin' bitch, suck a dick and two balls
I'm givin you all my job descrip'
Which is, to piss bitches and priests off with this
Pop more pills than police officers
Arrive at the scene and pull me off of kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But why'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all
'cause i'm so goddamn off the wall
I might as well as be a painting smashed on the floor

So how is everybody feelin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get rude and ill in a fight
'cause uh, we gettin down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if you don't want to bump to this... off the wall!

So how's everybody doin' tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
'cause uh, we gettin' down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if why'all don't want to bump to this... off the wall!

No matter what people say
I'm gon keep rappin' this way
No matter what you may think
I'm gon keep doin' my thing
No matter what people say
I'm gon keep doin' my thing
No matter... oh

You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like "oh my God he's trippin'"
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still copping a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but till I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald'shit's on, bruh! 
Let me sing this shit soprano while I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms 
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words 
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse 
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds

These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handies with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects so I'm batting cobwebs from a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice her age and I'm actin' half it 
Grow up? Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Klonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled , so's my manager
Bitch, I am mature, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me 'cause I don't own a mirror!
But, Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits, whiff it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives are butcher than gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into kaput ya
When I pull 'em like  sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times to make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms 
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words 
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse 
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds

Eight-year-old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape, 'cause you're in a slurrin' state
I'm a ten, you're an eight
Like what I do before, after and durin' rape!
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And be made a fool out of when I pull on 'em?
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college 
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner
Blow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie
You can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on and get the soap and try to
Get the Pope to hold me while you hose me off
And nope, I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone
Uh-huh, I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
Is what I tell myself when times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass 
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school 
You ain't have to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude 
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
It's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another mothafuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can simply because I can

'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms 
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words 
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse 
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
Till everybody eats my turds

Intro:
Oh no, what's happening to my brain?
I can't believe this is happening agay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ain.

Verse 1:
Lava out my lips I flips, wait I think I have a cramp
I'm tryin' ta shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
I think I'm outta gas man, I need another mask
I'd ask my mother but I think she's laughing at the plant
I have a gram of Graham crackers and some bandy camps
I'll think I'll eat some Ambiens like the candy yams
cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
abra-fucking-cadabra motherfucker, look who's back
just like a pendulum, Satan's pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
shit, I think I might'a did it when I was dancing
while I was chopping one of my legs off, when I pulled a hamstring
first I Re-Up, then I Relapse, go to rehab then I Detox after I see Doc
then I'll be back with the sequel, repeat the cycle
cause I react like the she-Hulk, when I see NyQuil 

Hook:
Oh no, here we go again
oh no, when it's going to end?
Oh no, where did it begin?
So long 'go, maybe way back when

Verse 2:
Into the well baby Jessica fell, she may have wetted herself
quit playing, get her some help, Mary Kay Letourneau was sending me letters from jail
every day in Journal saying how she wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
I'm the medicine man, my medical marijuana was prescribed by a doctor
shove a TIE fighter up Pe-rez Hilton's ass, shit almost forgot that
he's always shoving something up his ass, so why not that
and fuck it while I'm venting, let's shove a vending machine
up his rear end, when he's bending over pretending that he
didn't say anything that would be offending to me
stick his head in a blender begin blending and gee
where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair
put him under the stairs, people are already under there
hmm, I wonder where, wait I think the cupboard's bare
stuff him up in a Tupperware and shove him up in there

Hook:
Oh no, here we go again
oh no, when it's going to end?
Oh no, where did it begin?
So long 'go, maybe way back when

Verse 3:
Vicodin's like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
who am I kidding, I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after I came out of Brighton and
yeah rehab's nice, I have my name up in lights again
you see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her then dice her then
it sounds so enticin' isn't it nice when I'm hype again
On nights when I'm like this, no time to write this just type it in
if I could get my quick pen to slow down, would I write this thing
man I'm 'bout to hyperventilate, I just have hypertension 
I have the type of mental state you couldn't comprehend
and usually stupid of you for you to think I'm a friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again

Hook:
Oh no, here we go again
oh no, when it's going to end?
Oh no, where did it begin?
So long 'go, maybe way back when

Oh no 

Good evening!
This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet
That's eight million miles in the sky
Please, undo your seat belt for takeoff
You are now free to smoke about the cabin

I'm Dre from back in the day from
NWA from black and the gray from
Choking a bitch to smacking her face from
Stacking up bodies to
Racking their kegs up from
Racking a bitch to
Stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry
And I'm back with a tapeworm
And we was happening and rapping and tame at me
Shady for us competition
Faggot, there ain't none

Speak of the devil
It's attack of the rain man
Chainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun run, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon?
No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon
A great one
Wait, the day ain't funny man
It's urgent
I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best 
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best 

Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless
A nice environment
Surprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
Naked wives and Vicadin
Before I begin to get so high; pussy boy, I could spin
Fin, fin
Fuck the handle I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some French toast and show us some skin
I show you every inch grows of my foreskin
Show me nipple I pinch, throw up, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse, if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain

So one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best 
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best 

Now where there's smoke, there's fire
Where there's fire, there's flames
Where there's flames, there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games

Nah uh, he ain't playin'
He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane
Vodka and kreatine
Hypnotic and red bull
It's an incredible energy drink
And it's given me wings
I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl
You won't catch me, CSI
It's as easy as pie
And as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make them tremble and shake

Now put your smoke up in the air
And raise your henny and coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Lets get into it
You smoking with the triest and truest
I got the Midas touch
When it comes to rolling shit up
You motherfuckas ain't smoking
You just holding shit up
Now here we go
Let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
Cuz if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seeing is how I blew up off of puffing them trees

Well puffing ain't enough for me
Fuck yeah, light it up Cheech, come on
Smoke me out, cuz
Give me contact buzz
Get me on track
They love me when I'm on that stuff
But this earth calling Shady, man come on back 
Man we're losing him; he won't even respond back 
Now look at all the pretty women in here

Dre, it's hot
I think we better go check on their temperatures
I give them the thermometer
You get the bandages
Now baby just bend over
This won't hurt a damn bit,

And give me one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best 
I said one more time for old time's sake
Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake
Now just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go
You are now smoking with the best 

Yeah
Ya know?
Critics man,
Critics never got nothin' nice to say man
You know the one thing I notice about critics man?
Is, critics never ask me how my day went
Well I'm a tell 'em

Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blog up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro'
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flows tighter, hot headed as ghost rider
Cold hearted as spider man throwin' a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo-Rida
Inside a low rida with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? why is winter cold
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes
Listen dog Christmas is off this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds this is the salt
So get lost
Shit dissin' me is just like pissin' off the wizard of oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws and
Cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his draws
Ticklin' him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

You on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
Cause when you hot its like your burnin' up everyone else's cold
Your on fire
Man I'm so fuckin' sick I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
Your on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll
Cause when you say the shit to give the whole hip hop shop the blow
Your on fire, yeah your on fire

Yuh, I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses
If you mistook the for a song, look
This ain't a song its a warnin' to Brooke, Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet your a fuckin' flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin' a fan
Mister Mathers is the man
Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything metal, the ass of iron man
Turn him into plastic so for you to thinkin that you can stand
A fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah ask Denaun man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit widda fine crayon
Fuck it I ain't playin'
Pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind man
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you, this ain't savage you ain't never seen the brute
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke on a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut, boo
Sayin' you sick quit playin' you prick don't nobody care
Then why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one cause ain't nobody there
Nobody will fuckin' test me cause these hos wont even dare
I'm wastin' punchlines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw don't waste it save it psycho yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Micheal's hair

You on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
Cause when you hot its like your burnin' up everyone else's cold
Your on fire
Man I'm so I'm so hot my motherfucking fire truck is on fire homie
Your on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll
Cause when you say the shit to give the whole hip hop shop the blow
Your on fire, yeah your on fire
Your on fire

I told y'all mothafuckas I was comin' back 
What now nigga what now what 
You's the projects nigga 

 
One shot two shot three shot four shots 
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops 
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off 
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin' shots off 

You bitches is gone I'm dropped in the club 
And I'm tryna run and get my motherfuckin' gun 
 
Nigga fuck my wife I'm tryna run and save my motherfuckin' life 
Oh shit the shoot is comin' 
Bitches, hoes niggas is runnin' 
People shot all over the floor 
And I'm tryna make it to the St. Andrew's door 
That's the sound of the glock 
Even D-J House fucked around and go shot 
I done messed around and forgot my tec 
I don't see nobody but Fab Five and Hex 
 
These niggas is trippin' 
 
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at 
Bitches screamin' everywhere and niggas is wildin' 
Two minutes ago we was all jokin' and smilin' 
This chick is clingin' onto me sobbin' and sighin' 
Sayin' she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin' 
But its real and cats is gettin' killed 
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield 
And she got hit now she yellin' 
 
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me 
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape 
I ran and got my 38 I hope its not to late 

 

 
I'm on seven mile what the fuck was that 
Damn somebody hit me from the back 
 
With a gat nigga and my tire is flat 
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes 
 
I don't know but I can tell you what they drove 
It was a black Mitsubishi 
 
Man and I was on my way there 
Believe me I'm leavin' a carcus today 
I'm a park my car and walk the rest of the way 
I'm in the mood to strut, my A-K ain't even tuck 
I'm a meet you at the club we goin' fuck these hoes up 

I never seen no shit like this is my life before 
People will still camp out from the night before 
Sleepin' outside the door waitin' in line 
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform 
The fire marshals no, the venue's too small 
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd vans 
And some come walk from out the parkin' lot 
Get into an argument over a parkin' spot 
He's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off 
Missed who he's aimin' for six feet away's the door 
In St. Andrew's hall not a stray slidin' all over the place 
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall 
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off 
I'm posted up by the bar havin' a Mozeltoff 
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off 
Thank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun 
And where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him 
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre 
Nah I guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was 
I never saw him run so fast in my life 
Look at him haulin' ass I think he left his wife 
There she is on the ground bein' trampled 
I go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her 
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit 
My vest is barely able to handle it, its to thin 
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep 
Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it 
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps 
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin' it out 
But I can't see who he's shootin' it out with 
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin' his four fifth 

It's Friday night came to this bitch right 
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right 
I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight 
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm poppin' niggas tonight 
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge 
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in 
Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that this fucker
Shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker 
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show 
Third's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go 
 
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece 

Hey yo, what's up man? Hey, yo you been here all day man
Ya'll been here every weekend man, 
I don't ever get a chance to rap first man!
That's cause you whack!
What?!? I ain't whack nigga, I got some raps for all ya'll
Nigga my raps fresh, I'ma bust my raps first, 
you can bust yours after me if you want to
No no man, I'm going first, 
I'm getting tired of everybody wanted to go first man
You always rap first, 
I'm rapping I don't care what none of ya'll say, 
I'm fresh, I'm fresh

Thyme:
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
 I wanna know, I wanna know
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
 I wanna know, I wanna know

Verse 1: Eminem
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you sacrifice
The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes
Jacking life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
A stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula

Chorus: Thyme
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
 I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
 I wanna know, I wanna know

Verse 2: Eminem
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when u hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
I'll twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
Every dis you can take, personal
We ain't friends trying to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
So pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess

Chorus: Thyme
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
 I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic man and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow?
 I wanna know, I wanna know
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out!! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
 I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo let me get that mic man'
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic, who the fuck passed you the mic!!
I got the rhymes bitch, I'll kick that shit

I wanna be the best who ever did it
Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't
But if it is then God, if you're listenin'
Please grant me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreaming, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm coming off brash please forgive me
But, that's all I want

I just wanna be the illest MC 
The same time being as real as can be
Mayhem, sickness, murder, horror
These are the kind of words that describe my aura
G Rap, Ras Kass, Kurupt
Redman I am cut from that cloth
Write a rhyme about me, you a dead man
Cool J, I'm Bad video
Learned the whole routine and performed it for my father's friends
While they smoked and drank
Symphony, D.O.C. inspired me to write what
Would eventually put me on airplanes like B.o.B
Canibus, Wu-Tang, you know our history but hats off
When we rap this Jack Frost we outline the track chalk
Thank God for the one-two cadence
Thank God for the lunchroom tables
I'm trying to be the sickest nigga, dead or alive
And if I happen to fall short, it's been one hell of a ride
Chronic 1 and 2, looking up at the sky at the sun
Up until the day the sun is you
You listening to hip-hop, you in Jay's house
Wayne's house, Nas' house
Em's house, Our House

So welcome, to our house
Where no one, comes back out
You won't find, comfort
In here, in here, in here

When I was a little boy I wanted to be a rapper
Wanted to be on the radio and snapping pictures after
And so I grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter chatter
It started off wack
But in the words of a ten year old, my shit was getting phatter
I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill
Not knowing how the booth would feel, what's ADAT's and two inch reel
How you ad-lib? What's a punch? I ain't a boxer
But I sure enough learned the ropes, look D and Mike you made a monster
Now everyday's a game of Contra, I got 99 men
An infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen
This is my dream, don't fuck with it, I'm telling you
Cause anyone can get dusted as long as production is available
I'm disgusted as a fan, look how niggas sounding, damn
Weak head, ya'll suck bad, fuck swag and your kicks from South Japan
I'm finna to be the best in this profession
I've been invested all my life, so wipe your feet before you step in
Our house

So welcome, to our house
Where no one, comes back out
You won't find, comfort
In here, in here, in here

I wanna be the best who ever did it
Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't
But if it is then God, if you're listenin'
Please grant me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreaming, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm coming off brash please forgive me
But, that's all I want

I just wanna be the illest MC 
The same time being as real as can be

Yo, in my house, the lights out
No utilities in the facilities
Feeling my life's 'bout, to wipe out
These feelings I'm feeling be killing me
I pull the mic out, can't strike out
Cause if winning is really my enemy
I pull a nine out, blow my mind out
Is the end of me really serenity?
Man in my house, it's rap or die
Get a piece of that apple pie
Life is a Pharcyde song, and that bitch just passes by
So I, got lyrically complex, that way I could clock checks
Get my moms out the projects, with these concepts, competition can't digest
And then I stress cause the road is rough
I start feeling like shit's sour
The electricity in my will power could still power the twin towers
For ten hours, so send cowards
The message from Crooked I
Royce Da 5, Joe Budden, Em, Yaowa

In our, house we spit like Sig Sauers
The way I feel now I could spit for six hours
Straight, only way to be great, is to dig down, 
If you can hear this sound inside my head sounds like a fucking drive-by
That's what the inside of my mind's like
Looking back on my career, even hindsight, tunnel vision, 5 mics
Never wanted that so bad well I got-ta go mad
Nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these ho bags
That bother me, but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does
Even though you know that there will never come
A day someone blows past you, never was
Someone who's as dope as you ever was
And you hope that's, true cause the competitor in you
Couldn't let somebody be better than you
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back
What you gonna go back, to working a regular job?
Fuck that, I'm gonna go hard grab on my, gonads
Tell them fuck themselves
They call me a wigger like Renee Zell
But I raised hell like a stay-at-home dad
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to, gangrene when I'm, angry then I'm
Hulk Smash, so much passion but no compassion
If eyes are the windows to the soul
Then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassing
Alright now here we go
Dre stamped me now I'm stamping Yelawolf
Get ready for the most competitive
Clique in the world it's like Clash Of The Titans
I released the cracker it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done
None shall ever fuck with this squadron
So come on in, at your own risk
This is  Bitch!

So welcome, to our house
Where no one, comes back out
You won't find, comfort
In here, in here, in here

Nah, we ain't goin 
I love bein hated, it great it
Let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way
I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
And as long, as you keep fuckin with us, we keep fuckin you up
And keep pullin the rug from up under you
And what's ever more fucked up, is we enjoy what were doin
So much there ain't nothin that we love more than +Pullin Your Skirts Up+
And exposin you hoes so much, people are startin to wonder
What's up with them fuckin one dough a man under-els
Do unto others of you will have done under you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
When someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you 
You will ask youself, how come your mans
Didn't enter that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any irrationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start buildin
Soon as we enter the '106th & Park' building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
If someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fuckin with a ..

Fuckin with a peacekeeper, see you the nigga that greet this lyrical meat cleaver
That I eat ya, niggaz wanna keep speakin, like it ain't even that deep
I got heat that'll sweep a niggaz street 
See I wouldn't fuck with me neither, only heaven can help ya
I'll be searchin for you longer than the "Legend of Zelda"
Without a failure, there's gonna be hell to tell the
Captain that a bassett hound couldn't even smell ya
Body, when I hide ya, I be on that mob shit
You another Hoffa, under the Renaissance bitch
You get bombed like Lebanon  with my own tactic
I snatch your head like one of Saddam's kids

Motherfucker, I'll handle you
We can have it out on any Avenue
A +Average Man+ flipped into an animal
Shoot out your mandibles
Cannons and ammunition, reload with precision
Nigga know the mechanicals
Break the pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Push your crack vows, young Nino Brown
Chasin green is the dream, when your young and brown
Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now
A 'Dozen Dirty' niggaz and they all get down
Dissolve any problem that enlarge with ours
When revolvers we said "all men get down" 

While your punchin and tacklin punks
I'm handlin chumps, packin a pump
That's longer than the elephant trunk 
On the streets I'm a beast, I feast upon the weak
So speak beef, I'll shot you and scream "increase the peace"
A monster, pistol packin pushin niggaz off they Hondas
Starve ya, get it crackin, yankin bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleepin stuff, I was stealin the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up, before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets takin a nap, bleedin and Lugged up
+Who Want What+ like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep
Then fuck it, it will be ten sleepin 

Know much about my a land ski
Don't tustle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast no holsters
Approach us, throw heat straight from the soldiers 
We the soldiers, ya'll the youngsters 
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster 
Upstairs the Munsters, hand full of drama
You scared of the drama, bomber the monster 
I'm back nigga , I reappear
Shoot like , homie steer clear
Blackness, carcass covered with cat fish
We murkers with no purpose other than practice

There's three things I hate: liars, fakes and cheaters
Alcoholics, sluts and fuckin wife beaters
A gat that describes my life
I don't even know who song this is 
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop
At my release party in a pink tank top in Reeboks 
This Ja Rule beef I ain't gettin in
I'll meet an are & be	 singer to sing at my wedding
I turn your face into a fuckin meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy and go fishin with your granny
I'll +Shit on You+, I'll pee on R. Kelly too
This is Bizarre, see you "Devil's Night 2"

Thank you!

Go, go, go 
What the f*** are you doing?
Mothaf***er bail on me? F*** you!

Aw, you gotta be f***ing kidding me
Are you f***ing kidding me?
S***!
Get off

The parking lot
S***, ah!

F*** it!

Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy right?
I owe you for this one

I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong

Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend

Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above

They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty

I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong

I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong

The guns spark when the shots go off
Its fifty, they say its Fifty
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
Its fifty, man that wasn't Fifty, they don't holla my name

You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face, have your ass running
Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94' "We don't love them hoes"
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes .

I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong

I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong

Its fifty

Hey Em it's Paul aaah, listen I just got a call from the label and you're probably not goin' to be surprised but um Michael Jackson is extremely upset about the 'Just Lose It' video. And aah I mean he's pissed. So I..I don't know what he's gonna do but we gotta talk about how we're gonna handle this. Um, oh yeah any way..

Girl come to me now, I said come to me now

Come to me now? You gon' come to me now?
Apple in ya mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about
Twenty minutes or less, wit' my Hannibal mask
And when you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I know I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know

Yo, yo
Back again..
Ha, ha ha!
Turn it up a little bit, pick it up pick it up
Pick it up pick it up
Yo, pick it up

If you find a phone call in a tin westword line, what the hell you gonna do?
Pick it up, pick it up!
If your ball falls out with a pad on the floor, what the hell you gonna do?
Pick it up, pick it up!

While I'm smackin up girls to keep the hoes in check
The double S, Slim Shady wreck the London set
Sit back relax while my squad smokes crack
And tap your man back and be like, yeah you see that??
Ah yes, comin from the motherfuckin midwest
Lift your shirt up and lemme see them big breasts
We molest girls three times a day three times a night
I got G Fools and criminal peoples
Jumpin out when we ten deep
Beat you down and speed off in the Benz Jeep
Brothers be like, Eminem changed his style up
Shut the hell up, I'm still 7 miles, slut!
It's 9-7 so get with it
Peep that back in the day stuff when that Infinite tape was hittin
Listen, must we forget?
I originated all that rough shit
That talk drug shit
That left motherfuckers who try to sound like tough shit
Detroit City is where I grew up, bitch
Peace to all my outsiders in Jers
Forget what you heard, this is 3 and one third!

If you got a STD and yur penis falls on the floor, what the hell you gonna do?
Pick it up, pick it up!
Hah! Yeahhh, yeah yeahhh
And if you see a Slim Shady tape on the fuckin rack, what is Dre gonna do?
Ohhh..
On the oven rack..

I give deaf MC's step to the left
I bust MC's and my name is Wyclef
How are you doing I play the banjo, piano
Whatever it is, I rock like Barry Manilow
Yo its Slim Shady on the frickin deck
Y'all don't check it out I wreck the Frim Slady set
The Frim Shady is what I said because I'm frickin drunk
I pick it up pick it up, I sound like a punk

They wish to make a Bambi black, yo you standin back
Death methods, aiyyo got my hand in that
Whoever runnin it, aiyyo you get a damn knee capped
Make the healthiest in your fam.. handicapped
You a fan of rap, my clan'll have your school home, your bitch house
Pull my nine mili you gon' die with your fists out
The new God of rap, call me Bigger Thor
Snap your back when I slap your ass in the Figure Four
For miles around, they can feel us lethal
I make hardcore groups like Wu-Tang sound like the Village People

You can hate me now
Pop me in the face right now
You can hate me now
I'm so drunk that I'm throwin up now
You can hate me now
Deflate me now
Ahhhh

Hand me an 8th, beam me up, land me in space
I'mma sit on top of the world and spit on Brandi and Mase
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white person trapped in a room with Lauren Hill
Human orifile, be a lot funnier a plot
And people will feel because I'mma still be the Mad Rapper whether I got money or not
Long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot
I'll begin the canoe paddlin, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award, for the best rapper to get one mic in the Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back strikin a Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin me off
Even a No Limit tank looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
No duh I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you, then jump in the grave and bury myself?

You can hate me now..
Hate us..
Ha! Ha!

I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared, yeah yeah
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared 

You see, I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I see, I got my knife boy, I kill you, you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up and cage me
I'll come back bigger, stronger and angry

Look look, I come from a different crew, you fuck with me, I'll get to you
A clip or two'll cripple you, just 'cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop, a pussy drop, drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie miney moe, now tre pound or 44
Pick a strap to take the mag. The hawk I'll stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name
And where you rest, I'll make a mess
The holla tips'll hit ya chest, you cough up blood to EMS
Come pick you up, You know you fucked
When you get on a stretcher
'cause I'll come in ta ICU, to see you off to heaven
The system I done been through. If there's nothing you did to me
They locked me up they let me out, you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals, why they up in corrections?
They come on get a 9, nigga me grind to perfection
It's murder when they found the gun now they doing ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint this shit's going terrific
He's so close to your target that it's really hard to miss it

Man these are average raps, I'm keepin the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady Aftermath lid
You pop off the top it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octamom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnate her then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac 10s
Triplets, quadruplets and a couple of back to back twins
Dead fetuses fallin out all over, Jack is back again
The Rippers at your service, girl I can see that your nervous
But I barely scratch the surface, like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fuckin backyard. Still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out
It's past your curfew when its dark, I'm searchin for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month. They found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter top.

I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers, what a pill is to me,
Killing so villainously,
Still as maniacal on the Nyquil and psycho as Michael Myers,
You know what we're like on the muthafucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers.

It's operation time they got em hooked up to wires,
Queezing, he bleeding, wheezing, breathing he half dead,
He must say no, but now he know how shady the Math is,
Even murderous tactics, get better with practice,
Lead showers, gun powder, fill the tellers burn burn,
Truly ours Julia, you better learn learn.

Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah homie turn turn,
I'm debating, mutilating the lady,
You've been waiting for shady
And Fif. Ain't no duplicating it baby,
There's a baby in the drive, there's a torso in the washer,
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her,
Arms and legs in the garbage cos the rest of her, I lost her,
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her,
And put her through the ringer and hung her over the wash tub.

When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that'll cough up
A hard rock, a soft fuck
Get caught up and get washed up,
In Detroit or Northfolk,
When it's disrupt and nauseas,
Look deep in my eyes, see Many Many Men die,
I swing gym stars faster than Samurai.

I sense someone's tapping into my phones why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon
The F.B.I might be tryin' to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside of the window of my living room
And if they do you can say goodnight and bye bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man
Blank stare dead pan look at my face as I gaze into space
As I wait to be scooped up in that van
Mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gon' say a sniper just appeared out of nowhere
And I'll go down in the history as the blood sucking leech
Who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the Fifth Amendment use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dying to fill out in the heroes splinters
The business way to end this I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flash back to September 7th
When Tupac was murdered in Vegas
He said that he predicted his own death
Let us never forget it or should we ever live to regret it
Like the day John F Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By a craze lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block in a library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know or do they?
Who's they for them to say touche
We're all vulnerable and it's spooky
This is about as kooky as I've ever felt now
Count down to Nuclear Meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nuttin'
When it's time it's your time
You are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy Number One

This is a public service announcement brought to you in part by Slim Shady.
The views and events expressed here are totally fucked,
And are not necessarily the views of anyone.
However the events and suggestions that appear
On this album are not to be taken lightly.
Children should not partake in the listening of this album
With laces in their shoes.
Slim Shady is not responsible for your actions.
Upon purchasing this album you have agreed to not try this at home.
Anything else?
Yeah, don't do drugs.

This is another public service announcement
Brought to you in part by Slim Shady

Slim Shady does not give a fuck what you think

If you don't like it  you can suck his fucking cock

Little did you know upon purchasing this album
You have just kissed his ass!

Slim Shady is fed up with your shit
And he's going to kill you

Uh, anything else?

There I go, thinkin' of you again

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little poem
But off of the dome it would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head
That I could think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it I'm a start right here and just be brief
About to rattle off some other reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two, ooh
Now I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim, shit
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standin' here cryin' over you, boohoo

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter, that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to
A stupid piece of paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin' coke-head slut, I hope you fuckin' die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin' guts you fuckin' slut I hope you die, die
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me want to yack, ack
But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I want to do is puke

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

Hey yo dawg... I got some shit on my motha fuckin' chest... that 
I need to get I need to get off cause, if I don't...
I'm gonna fuckin explode, or somethin'
Now look - this is a story about...
some little fuckin' girls that I know
It goes like this...

It's so easy for me to make enemies any more it's sickening
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that, I don't wanna be in shit
I never had no beef with your corny son of a bitches
But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin to fix it
So I'm tellin you right now - motherFUCK a Limp Bizkit
Now I'm gonna be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin';
see he chilled
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin cypherin name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentionin me
That little fuckin weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talkin bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
Talkin bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin sissy, up on stage, screamin how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin my ass
Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song I'm tryin to pre-warn you
Lethal when I fuckin see you dawg I'm swingin on you!
Motherfuckers must think cause I'm in trouble with the law
that I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow

Y'all some - girrrrls - y'all are some god damn girls
Why do you act this way? - Why do you act this way huh?
Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies
keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
And we all knowwww - we all know, hah
How fuckin cowards rollll - keep rollin rollin rollin 
In fuckin Bentley's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow dowwwn

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
and I won't put you in 'em
Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
and I won't put you in 'em

Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
and I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dogs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
in my coffin I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again though 
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin off me
I'm not bein cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger 
I say Fuck Christina he says Fuck Christina but meaner
So from doin a song with Method to beggin to get accepted
I'm peggin Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin you up punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin
And fuck BIZKIT! Cause I know you're sayin fuck D-12
Only not to our face, under your breath, to yourselves

You little - girrrrls - motherfuckin females
Why do you act this way? - Why do y'all act this way huh?
Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies you pussies
keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
And we all knowwww - now we all know the truth
How fuckin cowards rollll - keep rollin rollin rollin 
In-fuckin-dent me's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and bow dowwwn

Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
and I won't put you in 'em
Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
and I won't put you in it

And that's it, that's all there is to it dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin song
don't say you're down with doin the fuckin song
and then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin MTV talkin about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog
just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin song myself
and not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin-you-up shit when I see you
And I will see you too; oh, and by the way Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Haha..

 
Yo.. I dedicate to this.. to yo.. 

 
To all my fans, keepin y'all in health 
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself 
Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart conditionin 
Which I create, cause that's my mission 
So listen close, to what we say 
Because this type of fag claims to never be gay, I.. 

 
.. knew you was jealous from the day that I met you 
I upset you, cause I get respect I pet you  
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew  
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you 
Peckerwood mad cause his record went wood 
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods 
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood 
And said, "Heck, country western rap records are good!!" 
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes 
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both  
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year 
Then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere 
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year 
No one's tryin to hear some fuckin old fart in a chair 
Sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear 
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea 
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career 
I punch you in your fuckin chest 'til your heart kicks in gear  
And fuck your underground buddy's nameless crew 
Like I'ma say their name so they can be famous too 

 
You just a.. quitter, and you bitter cause I came along 
and the days of House of Pain are gone 
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again 
I'ma kill you  

 
Yo.. heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke 
To the rap you wrote, your fuckin answer back's a joke 
And I'ma tell these motherfuckin fans the truth 
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you 
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you 
Like I ain't notice you? BITCH, I had a show to do! 
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you 
You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two 
Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you 
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you 
Took your motherfuckin DJ and stole him too 
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional 
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings 
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick 
Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap 
Quicker but never last, and Everlast is a.. 

 
You just a.. quitter, and you bitter cause I came along 
and the days of House of Pain are gone 
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again 
I'ma kill you  

 
Aight listen  
So this is what we ask of our fans 
If you ever see Everlast, *WHOOP HIS ASS* 
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him 
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a hoe, bitch-slap him 
Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp 
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid 
Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it 
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin! 
Shit in five years we'll all be "Eating at Whitey's" 
And he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets 
Aiyyo.. fuck this, cut this shit off 

 

Aiyyo Head, that's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker! 

 

Kill Whitey! - Hahaha 
Kill Whitey! - Detroit! What? What? 
Kill Whitey! - .. yo, yo 
Kill Whitey! - Haha! Look 

 
First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say 
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay 
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White 
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight 
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip 
Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead 
I keep 'em comin while you runnin out of breath 
Steady duckin while I'm punchin at your chest, you need to rest 
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya 
With your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released 
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MC's 
Who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks 
I let you faggots know it's on for life 
But Everlast might die tonight, haha 
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed 
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know! 

 
Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady 
Call the doctor to heal your heart 
They shocked you back to life at the clinic 
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute 
Honkey, I hit 'em up! 

Hahaha, yo check this out 
You faggots ain't even on my level 
I'ma let D-12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots! 

 
Yo! Get out the way yo, get out the way yo 
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped 
Eminem shocked him back, he had another heart attack 
Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin back 
Little faggot Hamburgular, I show you where the burgers are 
At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin ya 
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops 
Call the cops, I'ma beat your ass while they watch 

 
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik 
Where's your House of Pain now? There's only one of you Erik 
You a petty coward, you ain't ready to steady go a round 
with some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin Belle Isle Bridge 

 
Grab 380's when you see Slim Shady 
Call the doctor to heal your heart 
They shocked you back to life at the clinic 
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute 
Honkey, I hit 'em up! 

 
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still 
This ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin killed 
With his chest open 
Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin 
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime 
Cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme 
Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me 
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me 
I'm a paleface killer whale 
On his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha 
Erik remember when I passed you in the l

Some days I just want to up and call it quits,
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks,
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits,
My life's like one great big ball of shit,
If I could just put it all into all I spit,
Stead of always tryin to swallow it,instead of starin at this wall and shit,
While I sit writers block sick of all this shit, can't call it, shit,
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall if I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits,
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it,
I ain't dealin with another fuckin politic,
I'm like a skillet, bubblin until it filter's up,
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin up,
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough,
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up,
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts,
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,
Well I'ma show you what, you gon feel my rush,
You don't feel it then it must be too real to touch,
Bill the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up,
Goosebumps, yea, I'ma make your hair sit up,
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be,
I'ma make you hate me, cause you ain't me,
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see,
What you closed minded fucks were too blind to see,
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee, Out this world,
Ain't no one out they mind as me,
You need peace of mind, here's a piece of mine, all I need's a line,
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme,
To express how I'm really feelin at that time,
Yea sometimes, sometimes, sometimes,
Just sometimes, it's always me, how dark can these hallways be,
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half past three,
This half ass rhyme with this half ass piece of paper,
I'm desperate at my desk, if I could just get the rest of this shit off my chest again,
Stuck in this slump, can't think of nothin,
Fuck I'm stumped, uh, wait, here comes somethin,
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out,
New pad, krinkle it up and throw the shit out,
I'm fizzlin out, thought I figured it out,
Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out,
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I slave to this trade,
Cyanide, I spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up,
Want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want,
I'm a switch-hitter, bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter,
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a fuckin boilin point,
Put some oil in your joints, flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed,
An M.C.'s worst dream, I make em jinxed,
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence,
By the looks of em you would swear that Jaws was comin,
By the screams of em you would swear I'm sawin someone,
By the way they're runnin you would swear the law was comin,
It's now or never, and tonight it's all or nothin,
Mama, Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back,
He pinky-promised, I don't think he's honest,
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock,
Fuck this clock, I'ma make them eat this watch,
Don't believe me, watch, I'ma win this race,
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch,
I found my nitch, you gon hear my voice
Till you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice,
If I gotta scream til I have half a lung,
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it,
Rabbit run!

Dre 
Yeah, definitely, definitely dope.
Definitely, K-Mart.
Yeah, yeah

You find me offensive? I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw the line any fences
If so to what extent if at
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this,
Far at other people's expenses
I say your all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's down right blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I, had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman, I killed super-man
Man how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite the green chronic

'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is,
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is,
Rain man

Now in the Bible it says
Thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed,
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course, it's intercourse
And it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
But who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? 
I gotta question if I may? 
Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend 
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? 
But, up, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because

'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is,
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is,
Rain man

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where's the goddamn beat? 
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high fived Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away
And she blew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is,
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is,
Rain man

'Cause
Yo, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and seventy three thousand
Four hundred and sixty three
And seventy 

Last month I spent two weeks on a vacation
I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation
Did you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it?
I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music
I started off underground in a dark room
With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon
That transform to a pen in case of a words war
And opened the first door that led to the first floor
I got attacked by a couple of rap acts
They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks
I hit one over the head with a broken verb
The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word
But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys
And disappeared from the scene without makin' a noise
I used up four bars but I earned a punchline
And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned

We don't play those games
Would you listen here?
What I'm doin he're?
Get me outta here

We don't play those games
This is gettin' wild
Can you tell me how?
Let me out now

We don't play those games
How'd I get in here?
Let me outta here
What I'm doin' here?

We don't play those games
This is no fun
Got me on the run
Rap 2K1

I got attacked right away when I walked in
By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen
I put up my force shield to block any attempt
At this shrimp drainin' my life twenty percent
The floor opened up and I almost fell inside
But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side
And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap
I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag
And this chick was tryin' to be herd like she raised cattle
But I remembered somethin' I seen on the Blaze Battle
Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you
I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU
A record exec then appeared in a black limo
And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos
And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill
So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill

I made it to the next level: Above Ground
My soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound
I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked
And that's when this A&R crawled from under a rock
And start shootin' opinions, I stop, drop and I roll
Cause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul
I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly
His street team was up on the roof tryin' to snipe me
It took a while to finish em all but I finally did it
Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic
With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama
My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor
Now I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves
I'm runnin' towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades
But he was right behind me holdin' a flame thrower
So I jumped through the blades and I died, game over

The rap game, hip hop 101
The hardest nine to five you'll ever have
You can't learn this shit in no history book
You ready to rap motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul? hahaha
The rap game will fuck you up

I'mma disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You should've slain me as a baby
Behavin' shadier than Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of layin' a nigga down daily
You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
I've never fucked up to where I can't whoop ya ass
You'll neck'll get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
Is he rappin'? It's cool but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens: these dudes get rude then I lose it
I'm scandalous, I blow ya two niggas off the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga
You are not realer, in fact you're feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, y'all presidents since he smacked
And got a mack 10 with it, so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistakin' me black
Cause you'll be stankin' in the back of a fuckin' Cadillac

I'ma get snuffed, cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down, when the  just wiped out
When I see that little  dike get sniped out
Lights out, bitch adios, goodnight  
Now put that in ya little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute cause the hype has died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfuck ducked, what the fuck? son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword or sensai
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that utslay itchbay
Ucksay my ikcday, 'scuse my igpay atinlay
But uckfay you igpay

This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin' you, no it ain't happening
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game

I wouldn't wanna be drinkin', drowned in my own inequity
But fucked that I'ma rap 'til y'all all get sick of me
And clutch my nuts sack and spit all who pick at me
A pitt and rott mix, fuck the dogs you sic on me
I'm sayin' you motherfuckers don't know us, quit playin'
If I'm broke, then I'm breakin' up in the place where you layin'
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I look at this, why speak on when I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed, take a piss and he stand?
OK, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no Source never made me not buy an album when they say it was whack

I walk in that party and just start bussin' 
Right after I hear the last verse of "Self Destruction"
This liquor makes me wanna blast the chrome
To let you know +The Time+ without Morris Day and Jerome 
I'm low down and shifty, quickly call Swifty
To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with 50
Ya feelin' lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chuckie Cheese
With ya seed, you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable, a partyin' addict
They said no fightin' in the club so I brought me a 'matic
Coughin' the static, I jump niggas, call me a rabbit
Poppin' the tablet and guns to soften my habit

Believe me, we run this rap shit, for sheezy
Make makin' millions look easy
Everywhere you turn you see me, you hear me
Believe me, before you see my pistol in 3-D
No time to call a peace treaty
Dial 911 cause you need the- police to help you believe me

I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twistin' my words
We finally could "Say Goodbye to Hollywood"
Cause Proof and Shyne man shit nothin' in common
The nastiest band with gas in each hand
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse, fuck ya stature dog
Nothin' to do with hands when I clap at y'all
Put your jaw on the ground with the four and the pound
Then I'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with gats
Matter of fact, we can battle for plaques 

I'm too fuckin' retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick
That's why I'm datin' Lorraina Bobbet
My crew had an argument, who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well I really didn't, but I did accordin' to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
Freezin' 20 below, forced to join Bel Biv Devoe
My little girl, she shouldn't listen to these lyrics
That's why I glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm startin' a group with Garth Brooks
Hahahaha, 50 sing the hook

This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
And I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm tellin' you, know it ain't happening
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't sellin' my soul for this rap game
I ain't diggin' no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game

Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it 
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic 
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac
The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since
MC's get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I got a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
To keep up with the same pace looking boy

'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard

So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to,
Censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Marshall Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've
Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You're like normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, 
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to,
Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?

Remember me? 
Remember me? 
Remember me? 
Remember me? 

For this, why it's the X, you retarded?
'Cause I grab the mic and get down, like syndrome
Hide in Rome and to the masses, without boundaries
Which qualifies me for the term "universal"
Without no rehearsal, colleague words is controversial
Like I'm not, the one you want to contest, see
'Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got "Banned From TV"
Heavyweight get up, watch you're whole head split up
Loco is the motion, weed comin' through
Hollow tips in the lead, the .45 through

Remember me? 
Remember me? 
Remember me? 
Remember me? 

Niggas catchin' "no" for an answer, ghetto no
Yeah, I've been told no but it's more like
"No, no, no!!"
Life's a bitch, yeah it'll fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This ved is a head, the shit is all redder, you deader and deader
I better extended the cheddars and credda
Instead of vendetta, a mellow beretta from ghetto to gutter
Evidence? Nope! Never leave a shredda
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me and hate me
My moms got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dike bitches total
Want beef, nigga? Psh better dead that shit
My name should be "Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit"
Probably say "he ain't a killa", but I'm killin' myself
Smoke def, fuck bitches raw, on the kitchen floor
So think what I'm a do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a bullet too
What you want to do, cocksuckers? We're glockbusters
'Til the cops cuff us, gonna start ruckus and drop blockbusters
'Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin' wires niggas wantin' me dead
Wantin' my head, you think it could be somethin' I said?

Remember me? 
Remember me? 
Remember me? 
Remember me? 

When I go out, I'm a go out shootin'
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
I'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image,
So I promised the fuckin' critics
I wouldn't say "fuckin'" for six minutes

My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blond
So I made me a song, killed her and put Haley on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom

Came home, and somebody must've broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
Sick sick dreams of picnic scenes, two kids, sixteen
With M-16's with ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clintin's speech to fix these streets?
Fuck that! Psh you fagots can vanish to volcanic ash
And re-appear in hell with a can of gas, and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at

Don't you remember me?
Remember me?
Remember me?!
Remember me?!

Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt-chin
Callin' all party animals, get
On the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go with
I spot you at first glance and go "shit!"
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what, huh?
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow "whee"
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me 
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty 

You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too
With me on it

I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me 
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty 

Said said can I take you home, where we can be alone?
Shorty, you the shit, girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceilin'
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
Crystal, let's slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
Screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I'm fallin' in like, that's kinda, why I love

I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me 
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty

Motherfuckers,
Say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels 
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doing
What I do through and through and
I give you the news, with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade, you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
Pop toasters, and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggas crotched over
Mommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around, now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without riding 'round
Hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt

Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace, and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then why y'all  swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Using his music to steer it sharing his views in his marriage
But there's a huge interference, they're saying you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America
As a motherfucking drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fucking do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage!
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't
Think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go, he's 
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass it's just the

Renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at, any given time of day
Cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to talk
About anything  anything , renegade!

 Never been afraid to holler)
 Anything )

I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
What you hollering? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feeling braver
Doo-rag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box leftier often
My pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown, 'specially on nights
I brought something home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up
Raisin my fingers to critics, raisin my head to the sky
Big I did it, multi before I die 
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do?  I'm just a kid from the gutter
Making this butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a motherfucking

I've drowned in high from the ashes
Now I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything go grasp
At ends of what's left over
And the lights in every broken
Blown-out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival

 Marshall
 I don't have one

My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap, I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
About to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm

A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog
Can't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small
It says ever since I drove a 79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to Die Hard
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip hop ain't dying on my watch

But sometimes, when I'm sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine? Don't got, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promise land
And threaten everyone, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

 Marshall
 I don't know him, but I wonder
 Ha-ha

No! If he had, he wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad, yeah, dad
I'm The epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start dancing
Even if it is Charles Manson who just happens, To be rapping
Blue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank
Lamping in my K-Mart mansion, I'm in the style department
With a pile in my car, ripping the aisle apart
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content
Completely, despondent, and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on, a
Beat killing spree, your honor, I must, plea
Guilty, cause I sparked a, Revolution
Rebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap
To take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
 Is that me? It belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch
Cause its the'

It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time, give it to you easy, when I take back what's mine
With pleasured hands, and torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done, cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing

 Shady
 I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
 Doubt it, ha

So yeah dad let's walk
Let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block
Without me knocking your block off
This is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm always so bananas
I appeal to all those walks of like
Whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again
It's a stare ruckle, I chuckle
Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh oh, better beware knuckleheads
The sound of my hustle says don't knock
The doors broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold cocked
You critics come pay me a visit
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out
A completely brain dead Rainman
Doing a bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than
All 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef
Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look
For a fucking reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a criminal
Ten year old degenerate grabbing on my genitals
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to sing is
Dad, I'm back at it again
Bitch

Once you call my name out things will never be the same....
They should have never let us get off foot in this game...
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode
And have another episode where I let it go as far as
The one with Benzino did I'm waitin for that next beef, 
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin bananas, 
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fuckin pole vault with
Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated 
Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game
Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing,
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
They all tryin to get that stamp
They after that Shady - Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probaly just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin jackpot for me 
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery 
And a damn slot machine at the same time as eachother
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
When we rhyme with eachother 
In time we discovered that we have more in common 
Then we thought with eachother
Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
Cause we started thinkin god doesn't love us
Two odd motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up in ??
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wond-erin
Even if I'm under the gun 
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit 
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual
Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all 
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats
Stompin, I been rompin since Tim Dogg was hollerin
'Fuck Compton'
I was whilin', freestylin back when they was still makin Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet 
That tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky-Ticky-Toc-Ticky-Ticky-Toc
Still with the Diggy-Diggy-Doc-Diggy-Diggy-Doc
And you don't stop

Aw man
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?

You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
From splitting your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say "Isn't this great?"
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
That's starting to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late
It's absolute pandemonium
Whisked away in an ambulance is your fate
Nothing nobody told you when you left the house today
Could of made you anticipate auch an ass-whipping, okay
'Til the anger dissipates
You get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
Cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh hell nah
He must be trying to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
Cause they want in on the act, there's a cognac bottle
We snuck it in cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like "This guy might hurt me"
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose
Pussy the louder you yell the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose
We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us and
Adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe for nothing
My signature ligature marks, look at you all
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick it's Bizarre
Shit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As having me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ah
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches

Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feeling hard as hell right now homie
I almost feel
Invincible and shit
Ay Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool
I'm unstoppable
Damn

I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner trying to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion
Its all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
'Cause I think I started hallucinating
'Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit
And all I can do is follow the music
And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin' water balloons with nail polish remover
Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I feel uptight I gotta get looser
After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice so I'm not as diluted
Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi but that coochie that passed
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
But juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth waterin' too so I walked up to it like I'm Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll Introduce ya
Oh I'm a misogynist too but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth
A chronic abuser, not only user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
And a Rottweiler too, I'm not in the mood so
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
God, I'm gonna puke
I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, a fuckin' stone like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes
To replace next up Veronica's boobs
And uhh, paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
The girl was just not the one suitable for or

Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen
Don't laugh, please listen

Thought I'd give in to the pressure
Collapse and crumble perhaps
Relapsing under that
Well that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like its a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
'Cause push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked, I'm coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled had some struggles yeah
But that passionate hunger's back
The fantastic juggling act
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics
But in fact
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
After I strapped the duffel bag to my back
And stuck the massive punchin' bag in it
An elastic bungee strap, proper plaster, a thumb tack
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
And for my last trick, lunge on back lash
On a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half
Chuckled and laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal
And just asked him to come crash
And I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress
And ceramic construction hat
Rubbed my magic mushroom tat
Fell off then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up then gas, lungs collapse
And that's more likely than finding someone that's

Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen
Don't laugh, please listen

Couple of shots of J'ger
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
"You're top ten ain't cha?" stop cause you fuckers are talkin' crazy
And stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is
I came to fuck with your occupation
You're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs
And you brought the scalpel and sponge
The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once you done swapped your name with him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
Dug him up Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles baking
Fuckin' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle
They flung it across the table
Then bump it and knock it shake it
Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience
Since they all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Doctor Dre
So then what does it got you thinkin'
You can fuck with this operation
Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazing
I'm still pluggin' along
No need for an assumption
Here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
Some pocket change and a little integrity
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
Till I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit you not like I'm fucked up with constipation
That day will come before I stumble upon some lady that's

Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen
Don't laugh, please listen

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit 

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's , my name's 
River , river run
Call me , call me 
River , we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one 
I don't want to admit to something 
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

Ayo, this song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm about to burst this Tec at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in their Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
When snakes slither in the grass spineless

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
Cause when we die we know we all goin' the same way
Cause it's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
I'm comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
Live half a life and throw the rest away

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbin', deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
If it means I end up burnin' in hell, scorchin' in flames
If it means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
Cause right now, I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got em
I'm screaming like them two cops when 2Pac shot em
Holding 2 Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on em
And while you flaunt em I could be takin' em to shops to pawn em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want em?
Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear

Can't stop the hustle, Royce nickel nine
Glock stops the tussle, nine shots'll bust you
Pine box'll stuff you, fuck you!

"Rock wit me" *scratches* 
"Rock city" *scratches*

Suburban and city niggaz hustle together
Long as it's money envolved, niggaz'll tussle together
Long as the hustle's a hustle, the green is green
White is white, nigga we buyin if the price is right

So  drop the mics
Everything's on cock, from the shots to the dice
We are not into hype
You can't say we can't work

Either we some plant workers or we some niggaz that plant work
 Detroit bitches is bout it
You can just ask any one of ya niggaz that visit about it
Any Seven Mile bitch know how to get rich

She'll fuck you till you sleep PLUS lie to ya bitch
Plus she'll suck and swallow up outta ya dick
And she'll keep a sugar daddy that'll buy her some shit, come on!

 +

"Rock wit me" *scratches* 
"Rock city" *scratches* 
"Rock city" *scratches* 

"The city with the bars, where the goons with the cars, to produce, here we are.."

Looted casinos, car shuffles, numbers to bet
Disrespect and get a new smile under ya neck
A city full of thug-ass niggaz, and punk-rockers
Alotta niggaz act like Pac so cops watch 'em

And shot blocks up in the black or the light Timbs
White boys, look, act, and rap like Slim 
Fight Music, knife users never respect it
Guns talk  high schools with metal detectors

A city full of Tommy Hirst thumpers
Grant Hill hoopers, Barry Sanders runners, stunners
Chaldeans wit weed connects like whoa!
Type of weed, no need to test like 'dro

Type of cats who got dough, they like 
You real, then you might go.. 

"Rock city.. rock on!" 
"Rock city" *scratches* 
"Rock city.. rock on!" 
"Rock wit me" *scratches* 
"Rock city" *scratches*

Slim Shady 
Uh uh, won't you come and rock with us? 
Won't you come on the block with us? 

Won't you come and rock with us? 
Rock City... touch it... 

Okay
I am going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me

Mic check 1, 2
We recording?
I'm cancerous
So when I dis you, you wouldn't want to answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangled you to death and I choked you again
And break your fuckin' legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef wit' me, I'm even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off the funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean i lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les '
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people
And drink and jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date wit' Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat wit a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave

Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must of been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed 'em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray an Aerosol can up in the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue
Wit' your dead grandmother's corpse then throw it on your porch
Jumped into a chicken hawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat Fog Horn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, wit' deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother are you there, I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head wit that shovel
Will someone explain to my brain
That I just severed a main vein
With a chainsaw and I'm in pain
I take a breather and sigh
Either I'm high, or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't even in this room neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then It's probably obvious that I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop it off with this solo shit it's over with
I bought cages tape opened it and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake I-D
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me
I've been with ten women who got H-I-V
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me
I tied a rope around my penis then I jumped from a tree
You probably want to grow up and be just like me

I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flat screen
 Plasma
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

I ain't into S and M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off,
and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off,
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollerin' 'Why, God?'
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones,
so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin' my music,
so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch 

The wo-world is my punchin' bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic

Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
 "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a stand, still, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
 Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli
These bitches callin' me 

A-a-a-a-all you lil' fagots can suck it
No homo', but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
You have the same passion that I have
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
You ass dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids 
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's  meets 

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Roman!
Roman!
Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's goin' on?
They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell!
I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman
Please!
Back to bed!
Run along!
Let's go!
Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys

Some days I just want to up and call it quits,
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks,
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits,
My life's like one great big ball of shit,
If I could just put it all into all I spit,
Stead of always tryin to swallow it,instead of starin at this wall and shit,
While I sit writers block sick of all this shit, can't call it, shit,
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall if I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits,
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it,
I ain't dealin with another fuckin politic,
I'm like a skillet, bubblin until it filter's up,
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin up,
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough,
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up,
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts,
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,
Well I'ma show you what, you gon feel my rush,
You don't feel it then it must be too real to touch,
Bill the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up,
Goosebumps, yea, I'ma make your hair sit up,
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be,
I'ma make you hate me, cause you ain't me,
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see,
What you closed minded fucks were too blind to see,
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee, Out this world,
Ain't no one out they mind as me,
You need peace of mind, here's a piece of mine, all I need's a line,
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme,
To express how I'm really feelin at that time,
Yea sometimes, sometimes, sometimes,
Just sometimes, it's always me, how dark can these hallways be,
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half past three,
This half ass rhyme with this half ass piece of paper,
I'm desperate at my desk, if I could just get the rest of this shit off my chest again,
Stuck in this slump, can't think of nothin,
Fuck I'm stumped, uh, wait, here comes somethin,
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out,
New pad, krinkle it up and throw the shit out,
I'm fizzlin out, thought I figured it out,
Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out,
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I slave to this trade,
Cyanide, I spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up,
Want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want,
I'm a switch-hitter, bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter,
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a fuckin boilin point,
Put some oil in your joints, flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed,
An M.C.'s worst dream, I make em jinxed,
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence,
By the looks of em you would swear that Jaws was comin,
By the screams of em you would swear I'm sawin someone,
By the way they're runnin you would swear the law was comin,
It's now or never, and tonight it's all or nothin,
Mama, Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back,
He pinky-promised, I don't think he's honest,
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock,
Fuck this clock, I'ma make them eat this watch,
Don't believe me, watch, I'ma win this race,
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch,
I found my nitch, you gon hear my voice
Till you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice,
If I gotta scream til I have half a lung,
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it,
Rabbit run!

Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outs in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outs in the area tearing things up 
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outs in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outs in the area tearing things up

Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outs in a fear of family presents

Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose
Stay skeed off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies

Call a go-go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock, twice for my block,

I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck
Throw up your hands, what?

Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer

I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna
And if you ever want to get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills

Or steal my reel-to-reel
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsiders, we hot as Hell's flames is

And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges

I'm so weeded 
I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars 
Right off the top, then go back to the top
And then repeat it 

Write it down on the paper
And still be able to read it 
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals 
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds 

I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out
I been down with the Outs for ten thou-sand years

Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear

Lauryn, huh? Hill?

What? You want me to stop? Here?

Yeah
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
'Til she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head
Puff a tray bag, Outs never pay cabs

Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave
Yea, we all of the a volumes
What be the outcome?
We selling twenty million albums

Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five mic
And push a white Ac, with a bike rack

It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?
F' with we, what you expect to see
Death's your destiny, when it's my time for rest in peace

Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee

Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me

Come on yo
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what?
Outs in the area tearing things up

Out world baby

Yo
Same song and dance
Damn girl everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight

I'm looking at you yeah girl you're kinda taken back by
The whole rapper thing aren't ya?
Probably think you'll get slapped so damn hard ya
Wont even be able stand up straight aren't ya?
A couple rape charges people think you're a monster
The police constantly buggin' you non-stop
I walk up on you, well hello Tonya!
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You outta gas, do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back, why don't you put your laundry basket in the back?
And sit up front, I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a wrap
In broad day, no masks for this attack
I heard them say exact opposites attract
If that's fact it'll take task force to get you back

Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance
You'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song
You'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got
Give it your all
Look at you bawl
Why you cryin' to me
Same song and dance

The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four to six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
On nickelodeon flashed to little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in son
Look her she comes I'd better put out the big guns
"Hello Lindsay you're looking a little thin, hun'
How about a ride to rehab? get in cunt!
Starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl I'm just kidding let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wencher, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you it would have already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her with sixty six inches of extension chord

Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance
You'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song
You'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got
Give it your all
Look at you bawl
Why you cryin' to me
Same song and dance

My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts and skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me and made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs
But what was really going on was that I had developed a crush,
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collections of skeletons or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant's tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'm a tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight it's the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos and just
Climb the gate and ring the bell, like "hello my love"
I just picked your prescription for ceriquill up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one ever since at schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little girl
You hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
Come on toots give me the Valium alley-oop, I'll slam dunk it in your mouth till you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm about to make a new outfit outta you
A new outfit? shit I'll make a new suit outta you, shoot
Now show me how you move baby, do how you do

Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance
You'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't never gonna break that glass
The windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby sing that song
It's the last song
You'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing
Show me what you got
Give it your all
Look at you bawl
Why you cryin' to me
Same song and dance

Same kicking and screaming same crying and sobbing same song and dance
Same yelling and bleeding same begging and pleading same song and dance

Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood

I thought I had it all figured out I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself planted on my knees in cuffs
Which should of been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't just see this shit myself its me
Nobody could of seen this shit I felt
Knowing damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me the minute she was seen she just bailed
I'm standing and swingin' on like 30 people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' a heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, tryna get my feet on solid ground
So for now

Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood

Bury my face in comic books, 'cause I don't want to look
And nothing in this world is too much
I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would
And hit it for good and say good bye to Hollywood
I probably should 'cause these problems are piled all at once
'Cause everything that bothers me I got all bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank god I got a little girl
Now I'm a responsible father so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter laying in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cause I don't know how to do it
All I know is that I don't want her following in the footsteps
Of my dad 'cause I hate him so bad
Worst feeling I had was growing up to be like his fucking ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell em

Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood

I don't want to quit
This shit, it feels like this is it
For me to have this much I feel like this is it
This is not a game this fame the real life is as sick
Publicity my ass, consume my fucking dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done ill never look at gats
If I scrap, I'm a scrap it like I never whooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact
That I sacrificed everything I had
I never dreamed I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever could of asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood or mask
What about math? how come I wasn't never good at that
Its like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never would of rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, ill never get it back
I just want to leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from being no one and seein' everything blow up
And all you did was grow up M-Cin'
Its fucking crazy, all I wanted was to give Hailey the life I never had
I've forced us to live alienated, so I'm saying

Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye, say goodbye to Hollywood

Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good

So, goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good

This ain't beef man.
I don't know what the fuck to call it,
But no beef.
What up X?
This is it.

I float like big spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby
if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me
to do war, and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out
With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now

Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me
and make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?
I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now

I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name

Why do you hate me?  I came from nothin
Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me?  You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit  I struggle for survival
And now you tryin to act like my rival?
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
all the pain  all the agony 
All the horror  all the tragedy 
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life?  One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the FUCK?!  you think you talkin to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!

I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name

I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I "Square Dance" cause I'm sick of rappin circles
around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - c'mon
 No gangsta you ain't either
 But I know that I spit "Ether"
 I shoulda crossed your belly
 Show you I'm not R. Kelly
X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man - "Watch your fucking mouth"

I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name

For the last time man.
I'm through.

I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit, kick up dust, cuss till I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'm a pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick 'n rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going, first take
I make mistakes just keep it, no punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit, wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age, "But what about Jermaine?
"Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your lil' interviews and see what you're sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move
'Til I'm provoked, when I see you, I'm a step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of mini-yous, runnin' round your backyard swimmin' pools
Over eighty million records sold, and I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up 
Or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in
We'll have you black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry
That could save it when I'm gone and buried
To make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet, and I'm a only sting when I cornered
And I'm a only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
'Cause I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk, don't give a fuck
White-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill
Or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm, somethin' of a phenom, one puff of the chron
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer so come along wit us?
Come on

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?

Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin' all day
But I handled my business
'Cause it's work before play, don't look for trouble
But I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way, you fuck my night up
I'm a fuck up your day, bullet with your name
Sendin' it your way, that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it
And you'll die tryin' to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Like my old lady?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone 
And I'm back, I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad
And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head, you headed west, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest
And invest in something to protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth, all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best, in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend I'm a die a sudden death
Five mics in the Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect 'fore I breathe, to collect a fuckin' check

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?
'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
So who you playin' wit, huh?

What's your favorite scary movie?
Yo, Slim Shady 
Y'all wanna make a movie? 
We got the film right here

Yeah, I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really have to, I really slap you
King of Detroit, who they naming the city after
Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?
Expert, Bad & Evil is coming soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leaving all of you cats shitting kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cocking pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splitting the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packing semi
Speak darts; yo, you get paid?
Rhyming about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9", a street nigga with deep feeling
I keep illing, my steez willing to keep killing
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks; one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'm a pitbull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
Split y'all, holler, "It's on!", then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggas get pissed on claiming you pissed off

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers coming in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directing and starring in it

The one man on the planet
That'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this ' and you better inhale!
'Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy
Pushing a ten speed, screaming to Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers coming in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directing and starring in it

Bad, the Bad 
The Evil 
Put 'em together 
Two times, Slim Shady, Royce da 5'9"

Women Singing:
Ain't no one special, special like you 
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby 

Verse 1: Eminem
I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing
It's even tougher when sleeping
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving, you all I'm thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speaking
I got some game that I'm preparing to run
The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a 
touch 
I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You 
Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found

Chorus:
Women Singing:
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby 

Verse 2: Denaun Porter
Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable, nothing compares
I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie

Chorus:
Women Singing:
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby 
Ain't no one special, special like you 

(Like a verbal seduction, when
Seduction when I tell 'em)

I dunno man, just feels like, well a lot different

Kinda feels like, I'm on a whole different page right now

Feels strange but um, I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like

I feel like I'm morphin', into something that's so incredible, that I'm dwarfin'
All competitors, better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, and endorphins I effect
Your self esteem shatters his dialect
Comes blasting out your deck, she loves me
So much passion you'd expect this sort reaction from her yet
Your strong oh, you're fucking corny, you try to turn your charm on
Cause you just think you're Bishop the don Juan
But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like 'Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like "she's fucking with dude, she wants son"
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do? How you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closing her eyes, fantasizing of digging her nails in my back to this track

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

She's sitting there getting liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc, CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not, aw
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sick back and just keep rhyming one syllable, nah
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up, cause they're just not good enough
But I'm not giving up til I get my respect, and I won't stop til I get enough
Cause I'm not living up to my own expectations, aw
That hater alarm is sounding off, and Obama took the bomb from my name, aw
So quit crying that I took your dame, homie she's my dame, aw
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came for it
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man I can't call it

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker
Dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducing her, loosing up with a little freestyle
Wait, am I losing ya? Am I making you look bad?
Well I got news for ya homie, you're losing her
Let her wait don am I losing ya don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryna show how, let me slow it down some
It's still gonna be a blowout
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something
To see if you can save any of it punk, but none of it's fucking with me
Prick you really feeling that bullshit?
You think you killing them syllables? quit playing
These beats ain't nothing to fool with
They call me fire Marshall, I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From sucking my dick, aw fuck

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do

Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you

Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
Aw shit, yeah
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what?
Aight, well I brought some friends with me too

Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin' I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin'
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'
Uh-oh! You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!
What's occurin' befo', after and durin the show
has no bearing on the bad news I'm baring, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No I'm pushin' you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fuckin feet 'til you get to squishin' a hoe
It's pandemo-nium standin' know when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're givin' me wood
You should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both
Break bread while I'm coppin' over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spittin' the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop fakin' the funk and start shakin' your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian of rap
and Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazin than that?
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?

I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy Io' fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the linin'
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69'in
It's like Rick James is shootin up your house nigga!
FUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!
You're screamin' fuck the world with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shovin' my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch, know I'm perfectly fit, for murder
because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil, we go Alfred, immune in mad cerebral
You on your last burrito!
 It's a wrap if you eatin'
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touchin' that
Good day and good night, Ortiz yo where the FUCK you at?

I'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years
ahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art, of you nice swear {?}
It's type weird cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishin' off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waitin to be hooked to IV as {?} as well when you look at my pee
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink, when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit
seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgustin' hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?

I'm right here lettin' the shottie pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winnin'
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flyin'
We do it to try to do without tryin'
 Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's, Jumpoff Joe Beezy?

Yeah!
God damn
Feels like a long time don't it
You missed us
We missed you
Shady narcotics
It's the re-up
Pussies
And we're back
Myself
D-12
50 Cent
Obie Trice
Stat Quo
And I would also like to introduce
The two newest members of the family
One goes by the name of Bobby Creek
The other goes by the name of Cashis
From Orange County
And I think it's about time we just cut the bulls***
Let's go

Shady, aftermath
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole, I think I'm losing control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget once get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Knowin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch is gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg and his sing some shit

Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen and dropped
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm a continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party 
Let's get it started 
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride with it
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeah me and Nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbuly, we finna finna have a party

We 'bout to have a party 
Let's get it started 
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' slut
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can say no but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine

Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him that you like it from behind

Now, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
We bout' to have a party 
Let's get it started 
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control

God, come one,
I ain't leavin' without you bitch
You're coming home with me
And my boy,
And his boy,
And his boy,
And his girl

Ha ha, Nate Dogg

Asshole
Any nigga wit guns, we got guns too
More heated, ready to outgun you
It's too late I already outgunned you

You was around, you know the outcome too
Let's play, lemme show you what Game is
Heartbreak, I'm showin' you what pain is
Please, I'm reppin' a 'd' homeboy

Where your guns, you steppin' to me homeboy
Royce five-nine's the name, niggas know
And niggas know, dealin' wit me niggas know
Hey toots, how you get here, you want to ride

I got a five in Southside, you want to drive
Beside, I ain't got no five, you gold-digger
You want to suga-daddy, go get you an old nigga
I got money, I'm just here to bug you girl
Can't get none, but you know I love you girl

She the one that want to 
Sayin' at the same time what I won't do
And every day I say I want you 
Where you come through, for me 

And if you come would you 
How you gon' tell me that you want to 
And then tell me what you won't do 
Why you gonna lie to me 

What up girl, wit you an' your ugly friend
She a two, you like sun times ten
Anyway I heard you when you did the 
Chicken call , snatchin' up men's

Tell what what you want, baby daddy got that
Gotta get it this week while there's no sales tax
You can't detect sarcasm, me I detect a freak who like orgasms 
Tre I hold you down matter fact I'll be a blast to pin yo ass down 

Tell your friends I'm still in your ear
She actin' like your pet, what you trained her this year
Tramp wit a pissy attitude, say I grind food, and I bet she be cool
All she want is attention, lemme give her some

Take this big face, get a cab, take yo ass home 
I wasn't that rude, this ain't Outkast, me and you
Yo mama, and yo cousin too, I'm tryin' to keep it simple
I'm tryin' to fuck you, see'mon

Okay, you want money, I want sex
We can both, take it or leave it, it makes us even
We like those freak hoes that like our style
Clean up that pole, go upside down

Us cuttin' the chains, it's just easy
I call you mama, you breast feed me
Wait, your tummy hurts , you feelin' better
You can blow, like the Neptunes, after the Jigga record

Me and my nigga Tre can tag team you
Grab our two-ways and both beam you
We can take you out, but your friends talkin' for ya
Oh, I'm sorry, you hungry, we got some sausage for ya

All it needs is a bun, and you can see it get pumped
Extra special sauce, now eat it for lunch
Size ten is the dick and the heat is the pump
Oh I see what you want, she so indecisive, cause

I'll shit on you, da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you, da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you, da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you, da da, da da, da da

I'll shit on you! I will shit on you
I'll shit on you! Girl you know, its true
I'll shit on you! Bitch or man, its true
I'll shit on you! I will shit on you

I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin' bombs to the back of record companies
Blow 'em up if they ain't want me
The national guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef, I got you hoes duckin' me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna 
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes endin' up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screamin'
Keep the motor on then I'm leavin' 
I'll shit on you!

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

I'm a alcoholic, with the fuckin' toilet
Pass the hot dogs 
Bitch shut your fuckin' mouth
I'm a keep eatin' 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out 
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fuckin' wit  baby sitter 
And all women ain't shit, only good for cookin', cleanin'
And sucking dick and that's it 
I was responsible for killin' John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

My adolescent years weren't shit 'til what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignorin' the shit how borin' it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who rapped me and say they can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
 I'll spit on you
Start pissin' and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin', I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin' my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants downward

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dyin' 
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with
I hang you up naked by your ankles danglin' 
My need I stay stranglin, I don't need your help
If you gon' give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt 
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest

Yo it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in choke holds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
 I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like D-Bo fightin' Peablo Bryson 
So what you hollerin' and yellin' about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin' skeleton out
Niggas get hit wit a two piece; bling bling
Wit a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
 Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimmin' pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too (*bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child 

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you
I will fuck you wife if you fuck with me
I'll shit on you

You heard me
Bitch, I'll shit on you
D-12 will shit on you
I'll shit on you

Your life
Your wife
Your kids
Your car
I'll shit on you
Your house
Your spouse
Your rings
Your things
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you
I'll shit on you

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go

 Sing with me, , sing for the years
 Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears 
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b
It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you

 Sing with me, , sing for the years
 Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears 
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can

 Sing with me, , sing for the years
 Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears 
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

 Sing with me, , sing for the years
 Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears

Shady
Convict
Upfront
Akon
Slim Shady

I see the one, because she be that lady!

Oh, I feel you creeping
I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like tae-bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Smack that all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that till you get sore
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that till you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh!

Smack that till you get sore
Smack that, oh-oh!

Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow, with the lock down
Convicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club now, and wardrobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now 
I see it dull and backed now
I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now

Oh, I feel you creeping
I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thang on
Get a lil' drink on
They goin' flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it!
Pedicure, manicure kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them puttie-cat dolls
Trying to hold my woody back through my drawers
Steps upstage, didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, shes like, "you're"
I'm like, ya, I know, lets cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus, from the club to the crib's like a mile away
Or more like a palace shall I say
And plus, I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact he is the one singing the song that's playing
Akon!

Oh, I feel you creeping
I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Smack that all on the floor

Smack that, oh-oh!

Eminem is rollin', D and 'em rollin'
And all marvelous them rolling
Women just holding big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be on Eminem throwin' "D!"
Hittin' on less than "three!"
Block wheel style like "whee!"
Girl, I can tell you want me because lately

Oh, I feel you creeping
I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo?
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like taboo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Yeah,
Ha ha, you feel that baby?
Yeah, I feel it too.
Damn.
You know, I'm so glad we could spend this time together
See, I'm not as crazy as you thought I was am I?
Ha ha

I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling,
I'm right back on 'em, with the
I can't call it
Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin', you take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!
Now, it all started with my father
I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
I'm as calm as the breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a
S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas?

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo, first I kiss your navel
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find something more stable
I told you I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April!
But thank you for staying April, I'm a make you learn
To appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggy-bear and all the kissy face, please
Initiate phase three! Missy now service me
Take another shot of Jagger, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!
I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you
Got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped, but I didn't hit you
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go,
Cause I'm on to the next girl,
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh!

I got you caught up in the rapture
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad ya sweating
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'
Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and
Throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up
Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'm a hang a sign up
Saying "Don't Disturb", shorty I'm so superb
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, so!
I can hold you in the morning
But in the evening I gotta go,
Cause I'm on to the next girl,
And the next girl I kinda like, oh, oh, oh!

I'm so bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again

I own a mansion, but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr.Brightside, glass is half full
But my tank is half empty, gasket just blew

This always happens, thirty minutes from home
Gotta lay a log cabin and only option I have is McDonald's bathroom
In a public stall dropping a football
So every time someone walks in the john I get Madden
''Shady, what up?''- What? Come on, man, I'm crapping
And you're asking me for my got damn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
''Thanks, dawg, name's Todd, a big fan''
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him ''Todd, you're the shit'' when does all of this crap end?
Can't park my ass without causing an accident
Puff my gas, cut my grass, can't take out the fucking trash
Without someone passing through my sub harassing
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow then bass suffering from succotash
But the antacid is my stomach gas
I mix my corn with my fucking mash
Potato, so what, ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upperclass
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass
Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me

They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I would doing if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd-sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned forty and still sag
Teenagers act more fucking mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me?
I leave on my own terms, asshole, I'm going berzerk
My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her, dag
Her nylons ran, her skirt snag
And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
Fucking my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick  work, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an encyclopedia Britannica, hell with a Playstation
I'm still on my first manual from Zelda
Nintendo, bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread
Make a sandwich with welch's and belch
They say this spray butter is bad for my health, but
I think there's more white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Redd Sanford welfare mentality helps to
Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still cramming the shelves full of hamburger helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt to
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves
God dammit to hell, I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I can yell, the
Other day someone got little elaborate and stuck a fucking dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catching up with me

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me

Got friends on Facebook, all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked

I'm trying to be lowkey, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce hunched over, giant nosebleed
Over stop as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
Show's over, I'm hiding in Kroeger buying groceries
He just had front row seats, told me to sign this poster
Then insults me "wow, up close didn't know you had crow's feet"
I'm at a crossroad lost till shopping at Costco
Sloppy Joe's, buck waffles
Got caught picking my nose, ah
Look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still up in one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em stuck at the light
This fucking shit is taking forever to change
I'm stuck, these bitches are loving it rubbing it in
Chuckling, couldn't do nothing, play it off
''What you bumping? Trunk Muzik? Yelawolf's better'', fucking bitch
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with another one after Recovery
Was so highly coveted, but what good is a fucking recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hopping on shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivison to fuck with, bitch
Quit snapping fucking pictures of my kids
I love my city, but you push me to my limit, what a pity
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out
Kool Aid stain on the couch, I'd never get it out
Bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouse, I'm living the dream

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me

Pick up the god damn phone

Bitch where the fuck were you Tuesday?
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio
Bitch what'd you do screw Dre?
You went there looking for me
Boo that excuse is too lame
Keep playing me you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg

You fake, lying slut you never told me you knew Dre
Que Lupe? You want to lose two legs
You try to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
"Ok yeeah, I'm coo-coo, hey?" Well, screw you

And I'd be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, four? Dre, Drake, Lupe? Oh touche
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one True Blue Ace
But you ain't and I can see you when you make
That little boo-boo face 'cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fucking Bluetooth ache
You feeling blue too late
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurfin' puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate

My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead 
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead 
I would feel so  much  better 

Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think
Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go
'Cause I told 'em I'm only driving drunk
'Cause that bitch drove me to drink I'm back on my fuck ho's
But a whole new hatred for blondes, but bias?
I hate all bitches the same, baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch you're such a broad statement
And I am channeling my anger through every single station it's on

'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say he-art
'Cause you ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you are?
Bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I la-la-la-la lesbian
Ah
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life would be so much better if you just

My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead 
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head
And I thought wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead 
I would feel so  much  better 

'Cause you told me
You'd love me,
Forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never
Wanted someone to die
So bad in my fucking, life
But fuck it there's other fish in the sea

And I'mma have a whale of a time
Being a single sailor for the night bitch on a scale
Of 1 to 10, shit I must be the holy grailer
Catch this ho I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name 

I might hit the club on a chica's tail, uh
Made for me say fuck it kick some shots back and hammer the nailer
These bitches tryna get atached with the failer
And latch him to the tail of my bumper
To scratch them with the back of my trailer like I'm itchin' to get hitched

Yeah I'm rich as a bitch but bitches ain't shit
I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me
That's what I call pitchin' a bicth

That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void bitch I'm a droid,
I void cupid stupid wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed

Oi oi oi, man oh man, you boy boy boys
Getting sick at these girls girls girls
Oink oink oink
You fucking pigs all you good boys doink doink doing

I got 99 problems and the bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of them I need a machine gun
I take 'em all out I hope you hear this song
And grow into a cardiac arrest
Have a heart attack and just drop dead
And I'mma throw a fucking party after this 'cause

My life will be so much better
If you just dropped dead 
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head 
And I thought wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead 
I would feel so  much  better 

I'm just playing bitch, you know I love you

Skylar Montgomery?
What do you want from me Roger?
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica.
Wait a minute.
You hold it right there.
Me and that woman love each other.
Love? What do you know of love?
We were destined to be together.
I met her on the beach

Are you out to destroy me?
No, Roger.
That's not what I want to do.
I love her!
And we're gonna be together, never

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just want to see if it's true
If it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it. If you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it 'til it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never stumble

I love pissin' you off, it gets me off
Like my lawyers when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfucking bouncer 6'2"
Who needs bullets, soon as I pull it you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot whether its your fault or not, 'cause

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never stumble

I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at 30
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me, 
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never stumble

Yo left, yo left, yo left
Right, left

Yo left, yo left, yo left
Right, left

Yo left, yo left, yo left
Right, left

Yo left, yo left, yo left
Right, left

We touch I feel a rush
We clutch
It isn't much but its enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust its torturous,
You must be a sorceress 'cause you just did the impossible
Gained my trust don't play games it'll be dangerous, if you fuck me over
'Cause if I get burnt I'ma show you what it's like to hurt
'Cause I've been treated like dirt before you and love is "evol"
Spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no ones fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mofuckin' hos
Bloodsucking succubuses, what the fuck is up with this,
I've tried in this department but
I ain't had no luck with this,
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin' to start over
I gotta hole in my heart for some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Something I wont go until you toy with my emotion so it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, I wasn't jokin' when I told ya
You take my breathe away
Your a supernova, and I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think is
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you, soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take,
Let's cut to the chase, 'fore a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open, that I wont be makin' a mistake

 I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you

So after a year and six months, no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts,
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you,
Let down my guards swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin' I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin' to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezin' til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason , I could think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Then I let you just go and just give
Before I put that gun to my temple, I told you this

And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star 'cause I'm a

I'm a space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you

If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools
Who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I been down that road, and now I'm back
Sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up,
Where I started from

I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hoe
You should know between us we was like mates
Nothing could intervene us especially no hoes
You was more so the shalon type I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights
I suppose that's how it goes,
With time spent emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you re-call I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelery off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'd even knew that, who would of even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's to hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked
And reach up under your seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you haul and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing almost haunting
That taunting ring

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

In most cases Stats attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public
We suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'm gonna trick off rip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix dyin' to commit
Feed you the best of me I should have fed you piss
We started off closer than close,
But who could have predicted to know your triflin' ways
Would of stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself do I love these hos? Nope!
Em introduced us
Fifty this is Tanya, Tanya this is fifty
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you had very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like a opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Says she's an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
Yeah, Yeah, now how many times I heard that shit

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

People! It feels so good to be back
Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing the new and improved, you know who

Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push
No friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pit bull off his leash
All this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Can-a-bitch don't want no beef with Slim? No!
Not even on my radar, so won't you please jump off my dick
Lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos from seance to seance
Aw-a-aw-sh-a-aw

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back
Boo! The boogie monster of rap, yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face in, push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like
This white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave,
Won't go nowhere, do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there
Oh yeah don't think I won't go there, go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh till your muthafuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinkin' the crap can't happen
Till you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrapping
Open the plastic and then you stand back gasping
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtracks crashin'
All this terror America demands action
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby, gettin' recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now, eatin' their food and their baked beans
I'm twenty-eight, they're gonna take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy? When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait,
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more, or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me shoot me
Psychotic, hypnotic product I got it the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on
And yada yada, god I talk a lotta hem de lay la la la
Oochie walla um da dah da dah da but you gotta gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit
Produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock, and Hennessey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege, somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry, like a fuckin' younger me, fuck the fee
I can get you jumped for free
Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I'm past bluffing, pass the K-Y,
Let's get ready for some intense, serious ass fucking!

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, 'cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down, and square dance with me!

Dr. Dre, wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas, wants to square dance with me
X to the Z, wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes, wants to square dance with me
Cana-bitch, won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch, won't square dance with me
Canada-bis, don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen, wants to square dance with you
Yee-Haw!

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up?  Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'm a name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
For four hours and you just said, "No."
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan, P.S. we should be together too

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Mister "I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans"
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you
Damn!

Yeah, yeah,
Follow me, follow me
Come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go to this place
The devil only knows of this world so dark
And oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold oh!

Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real
I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
Stay wide awake

A world so dark
A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go God only knows
Stay wide awake

Fe fi fo fum
I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park it's dark it's winter in December
I see my target with my car and park it and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider hi there girl you mighta
Heard of me before see whore your the kinda girl that I'd
Assault and rape and figure why not try to make your pussy wida
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kind of guy that's mild but I mite flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian girl now lets see ya have triplets and I'll
Disintegrate them babies as soon as that out her with formalda-
Hide and cyanide girl you can try and hide you can try to scream louder
No need for no gun powder that only takes all the fun outta
Murderin' I'd rather go vrim! vrim! and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh
Shit wait a minute I mean skull my knife seems dull

Stay wide awake

A world so dark
A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn

Stay wide awake

So dark and so cold my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide n' seek like Jason I'm so hungry
She's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient see I try to be but Gee why does she taunt me
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
And I creep right through the front see
So blatantly but silently cuz I know that she's sound asleep
Who's wakin' me so violently and why is he on top of me
He's rapin' me she try's to scream somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me he's biting me he's laughing likes it's funny
She's scrapin' me she's fightin' me she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin' me no dice ya see I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's alright with me man life can be so empty
Stay away from cuz I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat

Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real
I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart

Better try to stay wide awake or you might be found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep bitch your soul I'm a try to take
Pray for light today right away why do they try to fight today
I must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools how 'bout now are you in the shower
Scour you for six hours till outage your power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya
Must of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Power there's no one fowler bound ya the tub they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown you with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power such prowess look how you cower
Jumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' star wars
Jabba the Hut be di bye bye, be di bye bye it's time to die die
Ought to not even bother to scream it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday Damien bath me in holy water
Melting like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in a hunt there's no fun in that here I come with axe
Once I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' him up with that
What was that dial nine-one-one someone's comin' in from the back

Soon as my flow starts
I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real
I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever don't ya
Girl you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
Stay wide awake

A world so dark
A world so cold
A world where only some will go
But not return, when will they learn
Were do they go, God only knows
Stay wide awake

Hey!
Hey Em what's up?
Steve Berman what's goin' on man?
How you doin'? Good to see you again what's up?
Em could you come here and have a seat please?
Um yeah  what's?
Vanessa shut the door
Okay
So what's up? How's orders looking for the first week?
It would be better if you gave me nothing at all
What?
This album is less than nothing
I can't sell this fucking record!
What?
Do you know what's happening to me out there?
Wha-what's the problem?
Violent Ground told me to go fuck myself!
Who's Violent?
Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass!
Do you know what it feels like
To be told to have a record shoved up your ass?
But, I,
I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rappin' about big-screen T-V's, blunts, 40's and bitches
You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicadin
I mean
I can't sell this shit!
What?
Either change the record or it's not coming out!
What? I
Now get the fuck out of my office!
What am I supposed?
Now!
Alright man

A lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you? Good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

Zoning off one joint
Stop in a limo, hop in the window
Shopping the demo with gun point
A lyricist without a clue
What year is this?
Fuck a needle here's a sword body pierce with this
Live in the muck, never giving a fuck
Give me the keys I'm drunk, and I never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptying full clips and bury your guns in the mud
I've calmed down now
I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brains gone, my souls warm, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body is still being operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writing this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
Yo! I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass!

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I want to crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
I got your girl in my arm
And I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant fire bomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron on
And the pants to match 
I get a master chick with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives 
'Causing hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
Yo! I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass!

I wanted a album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spend a million a track and went over my budget 
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doing some bug switches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the woman fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a click, I'm a posse
Kamikaze strapping a mother fucking bomb across me
From the second I was born my momma lost me
And I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck I was born during a earthquake

To all the weed that I've smoked
Yo! this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To all the friends I used to have
Yo! I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
To all the drugs that I've done
Yo, I'm still goin' do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you to
To every time I reminisce
I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass!

Psst' hey' listen'
I love my job' it makes me feel like' SUPERMAN
Can u fly? I can. Wanna see? 

*chorus*
*I am only entertaining u, my goal is to stimulate, making u high, and take u and I to places u cant see, but I believe u can fly. I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying, im not ur mom, not ur dad, not ur guardian, just a man whos on the mic, so let me' entertain u* 

my lyrical content is constantly undefined no wonder y i constantly ryhme back to combat, attacks with constant concepts from lyrics that r constantly took out of context failure to communicate with congresses been a problem for the longest i guess but maybe one day we can make some progress food for thought see how long it takes to digest, feeling good when I should be ashamed shit I really should of fell when I stood, see I came like a flame in the night like a ghost in the dark theres a ray theres a light theres a hope theres a spark but when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye until they decide to set their differences aside and this is why only one of us will survive so children follow my lead and feel the vibe because,

*chorus* x1

My music can be slightly amusing u shouldn't take lyrics so serious it might be confusing trying to separate the truth from entertainment, its stupid aint it?  I get sick of trying to explain it, see I can try and sit and argue with u but it goes beyond just being a snot, pointy nose, bleached blonde cuz I came to uplift, let ur woes be gone, tell'em to get fucked and just mosey on constantly movin constantly usin the constitution as a form of restitution, bless the children, nothing less than brilliant let me entertain u like Robbie Willams ill be here when y'all are gone rebuildin, world revolving, world evolving, still Slim, how many kid will copy? Probably millions, but imma go this as a fuckin hobby till then cuz,

*chorus* x1

My lyrical content contains subject matter that sucks up all these fucked up young kids at an alarming rate, common denominate add it up and you'll see just y I dominate I try to stimulate but kids emulate and mimic every move u make 'Slim u great!' but wait can u see im only here to entertain? I gotta be the one to go against the grains man I see it, feel it, live it, but its inhumane for me to see u be influenced and pretend u aint but they don't understand that ive been through pain, if u get to know me I can be a friend u gain but u cant just stand there and try to touch, it hurts but your jealousy probably tears u up inside as much and its such a pleasure every button that I touch, I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust but,

*chorus* x1

Featuring Eminem
(uhh, hell yea man, hm, oh fuck yeah
When I'm not at home, beating my shit to death
I'm listening to the Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff, and I'm still mad as hell...fuck you)

I'm crazy with this razor with this razor I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed I'm crazy!
 GO BEAT JAY Z!
 ON DRE"S BEAT!
Ran in the ladies room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it
Came in the bank with a tank, fired a blank
At the clerk & handcuffed her ankles at the
Safe and thanked her, but I didn't take nothin
Every bullet came from the same gun
Just from different angles, 'cause I was pickin strange places to aim from

pay me

Psych, no way fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister 'cause I cought 'um in bed
I'm a crazy mothafucka might shoot me a fed
Or I just might start a fist fight instead
See as far as the dough go
I go loco, see me pumpin gas at your local saloco
Stuck off the hydro mixed with cocoa
Jump turn signs, then run from po po

Chorus 2x
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's a bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, slim shady is CRAZY!

Yo yo, I wish id been aborted
My pockets got a shortage
Everything I want to floss I can't afford it
I'm tryin to sell a ? my pops tryin to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad 'cause I still stand in line for clubs
Mad 'cause my rottweiler still shits on the rugs 
Feelin kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim shady gave me shroomz and I might trip out, like...
Fuck that slim keep that for yourself
You a crazy white dude and you need some help

I got a beautiful wife, kids and a gorgeous home
What would make jump in the tub with a cordless phone
I'm straight viscious I hit you with plates & dishes
Leave you 8 stitches, what I'm gay 'cause I hate bitches?
Slut, don't be nice to me, I've had it with girls
And id still be mad at the world, even if it apoligized to me 
You're hearin the last thoughts of a man about to blow his fuckin brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse
Spread out on a blood stained couch 
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George picturin Michael Jackson 
In a little boys drawer shoppin at toy stores
Shady said it shady mean it
I stayed admitted, ill throw a stroller at you, with a baby in it
Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fuckin pill mom, don't vaccuum!

Chorus 2x

You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you
And I believe I'm striding the roads, I guess I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
Snatch the keys from your hand
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

A beautiful face is all that you had
'Cause on the inside you're ugly, man
But you're all that I love
Aggressed, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
'Cause you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
Till I woke up to discover that that dream was dead

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide, uh
We were Bonnie and Clyde
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I
Felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
'Cause if you could've took my life you would've
It's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the
Other side of my pack and stuck a spike, too, should've
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time
No one could hurt me like you could've
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer
'Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And a life we could've had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'mma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends
I'm done being your punching bag
It was the November 31st today, would've been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say
But it came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
But I hate you cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy
And after all that's said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I maybe
I may never trust someone

But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhhh
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
'Cause I'm stronger than I was

*talking gibberish*
"translation"
so you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit,
cause i was high when i wrote so suck my dick.

Two pills i pop till' my pupils swell up like two pennies
i'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
a young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
so the rats can't chew trough the last pants
I'm like a mummy at night,fightin' with bright lightnin'
frightened with 5 little white Vicadin Pills bitin' him
i'm like a fuckin' was in the hospital lost
stingin' the fuck outta everything i came across in the halls
i light a candle and place it up on a mantle
grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
so when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
it's just to late
Cause once you're hung from the drapes,it's curtains

I'm an instigator, 380 slug pentrator
degrading, creating murders to kill haters
accused for every crime known thru the equator
they knew i did it, for having blood on my gators
my weed 'll hit you're chest like a double barrel gauge
i'm like a black grenade,that 'll blow up in you're face
with a fifth of me, when i guzzle Remi, i do shit on purpose
you never hear me say "forgive me"
i'm snatching every penny
i gotta be that way nigga, face it
that weed i sold to you brigade laced it
you high and i make the president get a facelift
niggas just afraid, handing me their bracelets
chilling in the lab,wasted
i'm the type that 'll drink Kahlua and Gin-throw up on the mic
your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
and even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit,
cause i was high when i wrote this so suck my dick.
Cause i don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit,
cause i was high when i wrote this so suck my dick

I'm a compulsive lier, setting my preacher on fire
slash you're tires,flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
plates expired, soon as i'm hired, i'm fired
jackin' my dick off in the bed of barb wire

Bitch can't you read the flyer?
special invited guest would be Richard Pryor

Nah bitch, i'm retired
fuckin' you're bitch in the ass with a tire iron
i'm ripped, i'm on an acid trip
My Dj's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
lettin' the record skip
lettin' the record skip

*Dj's schratching*
i'm fuckin' everything when i'm snortin'
it's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my Pit Bull an abortion
some bitch asked for my autograph
i called her a hore, spit beer in her face and laughed
i drop bombs like i was in Vietnam
all bitches ares hoes,even my stinkin' mom

Ay-yo flashback,2 seats,2 deep up in that ass crack
weed laced with somethin' , nigga pass that
in Amsterdam we only hang out with that hasj rats
at a 'Stop The Violence' rally i blast gats
be you're momma publishin', get you're ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up you're cash stack
raid you're motherfuckin' pockets,ASAP
i don't need a platinum chain bitch, i snatched Shaq's
born loser, half thief and half black
bring you're boys and you're guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rapper and their Jag's jacked
and find chupped up in a trash bag

Strangling rappers to the point they can't yell
cause their crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Wreckless, come from behind and snatch you're necklace
gruesome, and causin' more violence than 9 hoodlums
i grapple you're adam's apple until it crackle
run right past you,turn around, grab you and stab you
get executed, cause i'm a loony
i got a yuck mouth and it's polluted
i cock it back and shoot it
i love snatching up players, thugs and young ballas
shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
brigades barricade to bring the noise
while the bullets break up you're bones like Christmas Toys
if a go solo, i'm doing a song with polo
a big chinese nigga, screaming yo,yo!!!
i leave ya face leakin'
run up in church and smack the preacher while he's preachin'
take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats i sold weed and weights
i was straight until i got caught sellin' them shaped
i'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch you're rent
i got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
with the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
i've bin a con artist since i was swimmin' in water
in Cahoots with this nigga called Fall Out Von
who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb 
i signed to a local label for fun
say i got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
ride by you in the rain while you carry you're son
call you house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
got a reputation for havin' niggas run up they funds
used to be the type of nigga that was full of someone's
'Til i met you're fat mama, now i'm rollin in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit,
cause i was high when i wrote this so suck my dick.
Cause i don't giva a fuck if you don't like my shit,
cause i was high when i wrote this so suck my dick.

They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world

Oh boy you drive me crazy

Bitch you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now

I'll never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I'll tell the motherfucking slut to her face
Play new games, say new names, ever since I broke up with what's her face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash, I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? Fly through twice
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman

Don't get me wrong
I love these hoes
It's no secret
Everybody knows
Yeah we fucked
Bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends
I'll call you again,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that
Neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride
Between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
Never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe
I know you want me baby

Come be in Shady's world

Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl
First thing you said
I'm not phased,
I hang around big stars all day,
I don't see what the big deal is anyway,
You're just plain ol' Marshall to me
Ooh yeah girl run that game
Hailie Jade I love that name,
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
Rot in pieces' aw that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good lordy-wody you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands
Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans
But I do know one thing though
Bitches they come they go
Saturday through Sunday Monday
Monday through Sunday yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway hoe

I know you want me baby
I think I want you too
I think I love you baby
I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together
Let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby
You know I want you too
They call me Superman
I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl
Come be in Shady's world
Oh boy you drive me crazy
Bitch you make me hurl

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman

'Cause I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
I can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Can't be your superman
Your superman, your superman

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it
Wait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough, last chance to make this whole stadium erupt!

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust so,
Floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mu'fucka' and if I don't make the cut
What, like I give a fuck, I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt!
'Cause I just shitted on the mic, and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut
It's survival of what?

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
So take it all

So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't de-fuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do, as soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me, so pull out your pliers and your screw-drive-rs
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be a-llergic to failure 'cause every ime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go atchoo then achieve!

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all so take it all
So it take it all

It's not about lyrics anymore, it's about a hot beat and a catchy hook

If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
then so be it
cause nowadays these kids, jeez
don't give a shit about lyrics
all they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
long as they can go to the club and get blitz
pick up some chicks and get some digits
and the DJ's playing them hits
oh this my jam, this my sh-t
we don't know a word to a verse,
all we know is the chorus
cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
and the songs ginormous, the whole formula's switched
cause we don't know anymore, what are hits
is it the beat, is it the rap
is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
and how do we adapt and get TRL votes
when 13 year olds control the remote
and Ashley's got a brand new nose
we gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables

If the emphasis on the compact disc isn't the beat
than I'm gonna feature EM and get rich
and let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
bang bang look at the way my chain glow
the ring on my finger cost Jermaine a lot of dough, oh
the fuck am I busting my brain for?
its just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
you call this a lame flow
you bought the shit
I guess you to blame too
I just found the angle
no more reality flow
I'm tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
and call my publicist tell her, "We in press heaven"
no one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
so you want the chat room or the house of Malibu Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong Syllable

They said 30's the new 20
funny, must mean 40's the new 30
interesting cause ever since then it's been innocence
an extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
of the shit coming out right now
its all trash
the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it's his last and 50 and Em
then what? Detox drops what we got then
so now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
gambling every time we put a record out
just looking for that hook

Shorty I love you
and you love me too
we were meant to be cause shorty
you love me
and I love you too
and I promise I'll be true to you

Go shorty, its your birthday
you made it just in time to hear my wordplay
its the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
and run G for days used to see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I'm sick right into show, riding on lolo's
puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo's
don't fuck with the dodo's, I sling for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
you fuck around, you could get your ass smoked
look, its not a game, me B, I ain't playing
beep behind me player, so you here anyway
you don't hear what I'm saying
me fin-nini-na
fee-fi-dididee-yay
just give me my check and I'll be on my way
sunny bunny money and funny
you ain't even listening and I just took your money

There once was a time everywhere he turned
shady aftermath was all ya heard
but they say 50 sang too much
and Em got soft
and they say Dre just fell the fuck off
well fuck the fuck-offs
all y'all eat soft, be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault, oh!
new syllables eat ball, ya fucks-off's
your house, your bitch I'm getting sucked off
East, south, midwest, even up north
falling victim to wax, spitting, bring out the white chalk
all for the gingerbread, we get it and get lost
catch me if you can, I'm running past while y'all walk

Shady made me for bringing it back
for the history of rap
it's gone with a snap, a sneer and a clap
what happened to just spittin about living in the mothafucking city you at
in the grimiest condition, I breath in drama
King Mathers and Cash me, thats freak karma
I'm everything, anything, you could never be
its a hitting, rhyme in the month deep
I speak with a piece, no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
no rest contest, contract to sign
by blood I'm in this squad for life
hear out my wind pipes and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I'm crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I'm Rosemary's baby

Shorty I love you
and you love me too
we were meant to be cause shorty
you love me
and I love you too
and I promise I'll be true to you

It is not about lyrics anymore,
It is not about lyrics anymore
its about a hot beat, a hot beat
its about a hot beat, a hot beat
a hot hot hot beat
and a catchy hook
a hot hot hot beat
and a catchy hook
nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme smo, joe, toe and glow
now get out there and sell some goddamn records

Yeah
Make my vocals sound sexy
Come on man, come on man okay

It feels so wrong cos it feels so right
But its all right its OK with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Taking my ball and going home home

I'm that guy man
Shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mud holes in ya ass girl
Now lets cuddle
Blood curdlin' you're gurglin' on your blood
What I do for my next trick
I'm filling one duffle
I think I might just do something a little less subtle
Shove a fucking tonka truck up a little kid's butthole
Feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the Valentine's Day Massacre slash assassin
I slash her in the ass with a icicle
And leave her laying a blood bath
While I put a catheter in
And jump in the bath with her
In my spider-man mask man
Just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachio's damn I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio man rolling a fat one
Shady drop the magic marker put the cap on
God damn man are you that much of an asshole

I'm like Houdini
Tuck my teenyeenyweeny between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make shit disappear like Tara Reid in a bikini believe me homie
You don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from Jupiter
I'm trying to maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot
Don't move or ya might get it stuck so fucking far in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular sniffing glue through a tube in the studia
Now who do ya think is more fruitier
Wiener smothered in peanut butter putting on a tube of ya eye shadow and man it look nice
You should have seen it mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card
Then I'll go meet Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosy on over to Rosie O'Donnell's
With McDonald's jump on her lap and watch the Sopranos

Shady what are you doing chewing on a human
Grab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back boom
Assuming the fact that dudes in the back room
Using the bathroom vacuum and a raccoon
Skewing a rat or cat screwing a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom
You should be glad he didn't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance I'm back doing my dance ooh
But there afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathing suit and take her para sailing
Shady why you gotta pick on the lady for
Why you make her read eighty four bedtime stories to you in baby talk?
Cos I'm scared there's monster's under my bed
Kelly Pickler hit my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti dike well I can pee pee and write your name

Ayo, before I start this song man
I just wanna, thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was going through, growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too,
God it feels like I'm going psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?
You're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying
You're denying your health is declining with your self-esteem
You're crying out for help

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talking to the wall though I don't see nobody else 
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them it's you you fucking baby
Quit worrying 'bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fucking going crazy

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

So I picked myself off the ground and fucking swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fucking around
I got something to prove to fans 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowing up, oh and I'm blowing up all over my life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up
T.I. keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slaying 'em, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um

Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one whose crazy?
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)

So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just, forgot who the fuck I was man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else. I'm back! Ha ha

One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture why'all
Brought to you by the WOOOORRRLLLD FAMOUS Wake-Up Show!

Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!

When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling "Tech N9NE's filled"

This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit Withe-out
'cause why'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows 
Climped out of a nice house, 
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
"Hey that's my couch, bitch!"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys 
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
'cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, see now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of jake investigate

What? Sway can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do?
Rev can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!

Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway & Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin wit the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway & Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!
FRESH, FOR NINETY-NINE YOU SUCKAS!!!

And everyone should get along,
OK children quiet down, quiet down 
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day 
His name is Mr. Shady 
Children quiet down please 
Brian don't throw that  
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute 
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia  
Good luck Mr. Shady 

Hi there little boys and girls
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels 
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob  
Say hi Bob!  Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom 
And he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot 
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot 
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot 
And wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clock 
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog 
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks 
And even if they escaped and they got the cops 
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge 
Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job 
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk 
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off 
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker 
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka 
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr." 
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her 
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her 
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander 
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner 
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 
And what it might do to you 
So see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for you 

See children, drugs are bad  
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad  
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom  
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time  
So kids say no to drugs  
So you don't act like everyone else does  
Then there's really nothin' else to say  
Drugs are just bad, O-K? 

My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? 
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut  
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels? 
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world 
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it 
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid 
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back 
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back 
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old 
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold 
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys 
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it 
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyper-drive 
And his eyes roll back in his skull 
His back starts tah, look like the McDonald's Arches 
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him 
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!" 
Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny 
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money 
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over 
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga 
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac 
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you 

And last but not least, one of the most humongous 
Problems among young people today, is fungus 
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
Bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it 
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff 
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em.. 
And sometimes you see things that aren't there  
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair 
 It's yarn Claire 
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em  
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms 
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus 
Ya tongue gets, all swoll' up like a cow's tongue  
Cause it comes from a cow's dung  
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact 
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at  
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. 
They're gonna come for me and I'm a have to grow a goatee 
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault 
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
Cause I'm bad for you 

 

Come on children, clap along  
Sing along children  
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad  
So don't do drugs  
So there'll be more for me  
fart Ew, ah!) 

I'm gonna kill this bitch
I'm gonna kill him
I'm going to fucking jail
'Cause I'm gonna kill this bitch 

Yo man 

What? 

I don't know. I gotta really really bad feeling about this 

Man would you shut the fuck up Gary you always gotta bad feeling man
That's her car right there 

Alright let me park 

Just park 

I'm parkin'! 

Fuckin', turn the car off dog

Alright 

Alright we wait 

We wait for what? 

We wait until she comes out and then I'm gonna fuckin' kill her 

Man you ain't gonna kill no one. What the fuck did you bring that for? 

Man shut the fuck up dog
Just shut up. Fuckin' clip is empty 

Man don't point that shit at me 

Its not even loaded bitch, look 

Dude, God I fucking hate it when you do that shit 

Yeah but its funny as fuck 

Fuck around and kill me one of these days I swear 

Gets you every time
Is that her? 

Where? 

Right there motherfucker 

Yeah

Alright get out, get out

Fuck, here we go again

Get out!

What the fuck you want me to get under the car? 

Yo, who she walking with 

How the fuck am I suppose to know, you told me to duck down 

Its the fucking bouncer
Did she just kiss him 

I don't think so 

Dog, she just fucking kissed him 

No she didn't 

She's kissing him 

No she's not 

Oh shit

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothin' 

Well, that's nothin' 

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothin' 

Well, that's nothin' 

Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Well, that's nothin' 

Well, that's nothin' 

Yeah, we should do something like that

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady!

Yeah, we should do something like that

There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeroes and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'til we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' dem pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex, a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this whack ass rap, kiss my black ass

Nah, Em, tell 'em to kiss my black ass, the clean parts, to shitty parts,
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks, the Fif'll tear you're ass apart!
A game in this game, crush a motherfuckers free start,
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich, bitch,
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick,
Teflon wrapped on, 'case I get clapped on,
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home,
Still grindin', still shinin', nigga lord knows,
If I can whip the kick to spit sicker sick flows,
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it,
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it,
E'eryday Dre day, front and cause a maylay,
Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down,
I smile through summan' fowl, and watch my money pile,
I'm fuckin' with strict stacks, I'm kickin' you stripped fats,
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back!

Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Go 'head, funky funk up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, I hit yo' ass up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up! 
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, 
Shady, Shady

May I have your attention please?
May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're going to have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced
Throwing her over furniture
It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
And Dr Dre said
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement 
Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
Flippin' the you know who "yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parent's bedrooms
Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a women's clitoris is.
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
They got the discovery channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals,
Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too.
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me.
"But Slim what if you win wouldn't it be weird?"
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears.
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first.
Little bitch put me on blast on M-T-V
"Yeah he's cute but I think he's married to Kim, he he"
I should download her audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem V.D.
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I've been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me, who dress like me
Walk, talk and act like me, it just might be the next best thing,
But not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only giving you, things you joke about with your friends
Inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it 
I just shit it better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums, it's funny
'Cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting.
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jackin' off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' he could be workin' at Burger King
Spitten on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot circling,
Screaming I don't give a fuck with his windows down and system up
So will the real Shady, please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And to be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady, please stand up,
Please stand up,
Please stand up

Haha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us,
Fuck it,
Let's all stand up

Its all bad now man, its all bad
But yal done fucked up now
Yeah ha ha, new shit, hey yo
I just want the whole world to know: 

That I did not start this, but I will finish it

Comin up it never mattered was color you was
If you could spit then you could spit, that's it, that's what it was
Back when, motherfuckers was straight back packin
Cypherin, fightin for life in this rap
for the mic to get past and you psyched and you gasped
and you hyped cuz you last and you might whoop some ass
If you lost then you lost shake hands like a man
and you swallowed it, when the unsigned hype column
at The Source was like, the only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin, a four was like
you were the shit, now its like the least you get
three and a half now just means you a piece of shit
four and a half or five, means you Biggie, Jigga, Nas,
or Benzino I don't think you even realize
you playin with motherfuckers lives, I don't watched Dre
get fucked on The Chronic, probably cuz I was on it
Now you fucked me outta my mics twice I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin breath to get a five
Sh*t I was right, Ida fuckin died already tryin
I swear to God I never lie I bet that's why
you let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit we knew
You'd probably try to fuck us with Obie and 50 too
Fuck a relationship we through
No more Source with street cred, them days is dead
Dre's got A-Ks to Dave Mase's head
Every issue there's an eight page Made-Mens spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid, hes just a fuckin waste of lead
on my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old Gs bout to get smoked like raw weed
You don't know me or my motherfuckin mother you motherfuckin punk
Put me on your fuckin cover to sell your little sell out mag
I ain't mad I feel bad, here's an ad, here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit that you don't know about? ya
Lets talk about how your puttin you own son out there
To try to eat off him, cuz you missed your boat
You're never gonna float bitch you're just too old
No wonder your sore now ?? you're bored now
I'm pushin thirty your kickin forty's door down
Bitch this is war now, and you'll never beat me
all you do is cheat me out of quatables but you know
that you'll always see me on your TV
Cuz you gotta stay up till three in the mornin
To see your video played once on BET
So he-he-he who gets the last laugh?
Aftermath ya so on behalf on our whole staff
kiss our ass-hole cracks we'll never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzinos wack
no matter how many times I say his name, hell never blow jack
Your better off tryin to bring R-S-O back
Look at your track record that's how far it goes back
Its extortion ?? proportion
so half of the staff up there is fresh outta jail from Boston
Bullyin and bossin, caged like a slave they've completely brainwashed him
And forced him to stay locked in his own office afraid of the softest
fakest, wannabe gangster in New York
And its pitiful, cuz I never woulda said shit to you if you'd kept your mouth shut
Bitch now what? get a clue, spit it slay
New shit, exclusive ?? whoo kid
You know what to do with this: use it
I'm through, this is stupid, I cant believe I stooped to this
bullshit to do this...

And who you callin a bitch? Bitch. You owe me.

Dr. Dre

All you see is the sun, reflecting off the gun. Im Ready for the showdown to go down at one.
Sweat on my brow, let's settleit now.Im a show you how real cowboys get down.
Im polishing gold, waiting for this drama to unfold.I got a {blunt} rolled
Feelin bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
but I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said

You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
but I know you - the name's Slim - you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you..

Chorus: {unknown singer}

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die

 + 
He was "Shady," I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
 {*imitating Slick Rick*}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned

I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you

The Chronic!

Who?

Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun 

This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin around sayin he took the game from us

But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps

I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a "G Thang,"
and a verse from "Keep Their Heads Ringin"
I said "It's Dre's Day," and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin every which way

That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled

Chorus 2X

Always die..
The Wild.. Gotham
The Wild.. West {*BANG BANG, BANG*}
Ha ha, riiiiide 

This is the calm before the storm right here.
Wait, how was I gonna start this off? I forgot. ...
Oh yeah.

That's an awfully hot coffee pot,
Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Prob'ly not,
But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot.
Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it,
Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk,
I'm a walk inside a mosque on Ramadan,
And say a prayer that every time Melania talks,
She gets a mou' ah, I'm a stop.
But we better give Obama props,
'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze,
That'll prob'ly cause a nuclear holocaust,
And while the drama pops,
And he waits for shit to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up
And fly around 'til the bombing stops.
Intensities heightened, tensions are risin',
Trump, when it comes to givin' a shit, you're stingy as I am,
Except when it comes to having the balls to go against me, you hide 'em,
'Cause you don't got the fucking nuts, like an empty asylum,
Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for,
'Cause that's how he gets his fucking rocks off and he's orange,
Yeah, sick tan,
That's why he wants us to disband,
'Cause he cannot withstand,
The fact we're not afraid of Trump,
Fuck walkin' on egg shells, I came to stomp,
That's why he keeps screamin', "Drain the swamp!",
'Cause he's in quicksand.
It's like we take a step forwards, then backwards,
But this is his form of distraction,
Plus, he gets an enormous reaction,
When he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that,
Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada,
All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather,
Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.
Then says he wants to lower our taxes,
Then who's gonna pay for his extravagant trips,
Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same shit that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered,
Then does it more,
From his endorsement of Bannon,
Support for the Klansmen,
Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that's black,
And comes home from Iraq,
And is still told to go back to Africa,
Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa,
Who keeps ignoring our past historical, deplorable factors,
Now if you're a black athlete, you're a spoiled little brat for,
Trying to use your platform or your stature,
To try to give those a voice who don't have one,
He says, "You're spittin' in the face of vets who fought for us you bastards,"
Unless you're a POW who's tortured and battered,
'Cause to him, you're zeros,
'Cause he don't like his war heroes captured.
That's not disrespecting the military.
Fuck that! This is for Colin, ball up a fist,
And keep that shit balled like Donald the bitch,
"He's gonna get rid of all immigrants!"
"He's gonna build that thing up taller than this!"
Well, if he does build it, I hope it's rock solid with bricks,
'Cause like him in politics, I'm using all of his tricks,
'Cause I'm throwin' that piece of shit against the wall 'til it sticks,
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his,
I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against,
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split,
On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this: fuck you.

The rest of America stand up,
We love our military, and we love our country,
But we fucking hate Trump.

Only reason I dissed you in the first place is because you denied seeing me
Now I'm pissed off
Sit back and relax homey, kick back and relax, grab a six pack while I kick facts
Yeah Dre's sick track, perfect way to get back
Wanna hear something wick wack?
I got the exact same tat that's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now
Oh gee, is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee
Wow Mariah, I didn't expect her to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up before I put all them phone calls out you made to my house when you was wild n out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about
How many times you fly to my house? Still trying to count
Better shut your lying mouth if you don't want Nick finding out
You probably think cuz it's been so long if i had something on you I woulda did it by now
On the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixing our studio session down and sending it to mastering to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do
Mariah, it ever occur to you that I still have pictures?
However you prefer to do and goes for you too, Nick, faggot
You think I'm scared of you?
You gonna ruin my career you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt who made me put up with her psycho ass over 6 months and only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah, what you gonna say? I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly that you fucking had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base? What the fuck you tell Nick, punk?
In the second week we was dry humping. It's gotta count for something.
Listen, girly. Surely you don't want me to talk about how I nutted early cos ejaculated early and bus all over your belly, and you almost started hurling and said I was gross, go get a towel you're stomachs curling. Or maybe you do.
But if I'm embarrassing me, I'm embarrassing you and don't you dare say it isn't true.
As long as the song's getting airplay I'm dissing you.
I'm a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued.
I was gonna stop at 16. This is 32. This is 34 bars. We ain't even a third of the way through.
Damn, Slim. Mariah played you. Mariah who?
Oh did I say 'whore', Nick? I meant a liar too.
Like I've been goin off on you all this time for no reason.
Girl you out ya alcholic mind. Check ya wine cellar. Look at all the amounts of wine.
Like I sit around and think about you all the time.
I just think this is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme.
But it now i'm about to draw the line.
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb.

I can describe areas of your house that you wouldn't find on an episode of Cribs
A blubba load ribs if I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs cos every time you do it's just another load of fibs
I ain't saying this shit again, ho. You know what it is.
It's a warning shot for before I blow up ya whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fucking thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryin' to stick two CD's in the same spot

I love you too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo. Now what you say?

Guess what I'll do?
I'll refresh your memory when you said 'I want you'
Now should I keep going or should we call truce?

You bet your sweet ass I do

And I'm Superman, mmm

Comin' at you
So if you'll still be my 
Then I'll still be your 
Yeah, I'm right here

Nope. Not anymore, Dear.
It cuts like a  when I tell ya get a 
But I'm movin on with mine
Nick, is that your 
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
If she don't  then I'ma just keep goin

Whatever
Dre just let it run
Ey yo turn the beat up a little bit
Ey yo this song is for anyone
Fuck it just shut up and listen

Ey yo
I sit back, with this pack, of zigzags
And this bag, of this weed
It gives me, the shit needed to be, the most meanest MC on this
On this earth 'cause since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in its self to relieve
All this tension dispensing me, sentence is getting it
The stress has been eating me, recently
Off of this chest and I rest to get peacefully
But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When I'm eating or feeding my daughter to not come and speak to me
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr.'N Sync and I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr.Friendly, I can be a prick, if you tempt me my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me I'm lifting you ten feet
In the air, I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer
File you a lawsuit, I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean but it's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant, and "oh it's his lyrical content!"
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me and it seems
Like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or the pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up when you don't give a fuck
When you won't just put up with the bullshit they pull
'Cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn
And the heroin, where were the parents at?
And look at where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy, now it's so sad to see
An upper class city having this happening
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel
That I need for the fire to burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And drop from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is"
And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensations
They cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, what
When and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
You've been driving me crazy
I can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shit
In the bathroom without someone standing by it
No I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the papers, the news, everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Yeah! 
Aye em you ready? 
Herk, you got them thangs nigga? 
You know
Detroit city

There they go
Those d-town boys, carry the calico
Whenever there's war, you gots to know
Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

You are not convincin'
When detroit blocks stay flocked with henchman
Niggas get popped for instance
Infrared dot for distance
Get knocked by the cops, cop on some pension
Straight detention, a nigga doin' tension
Once released, he on that music business
Been viewin' 106 in them cafeterias
Only to find that raps actually serious
Deliriously so its back to crack and vigilance
Same shit to send them up in michigan
Us is pimpin', a difference from any city I've visited
Its that detroit spirit and if we in it
Ballin' out to the end, period
Use o' as the reference to that sentence
The message I'm sendin', you best just pay attention

There they go
Those d-town boys, carry the calico
Whenever there's war, you gots to know
Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

If you don't like how I act then blow me
I don't really give a shit, I represent the real cats who know me
Man what's up with that scratch you owe me
Now run my chips before we fall out like shaq and kobe
Big herk on a track with obie
When you come to the d, its cut throat, better be packin' homie
And niggas get they shit split for actin' phony
We're known for the glocks and the choppers
These niggas will rob you, leave you standin' in ya socks and ya boxers
We got real g's and lots of imposters
I smoke the real trees, see I cop from the rosters
Y'all niggas ain't impress me yet
Y'all yappin', not rappin', turn that shit off and press eject
See we known for the car shows, runnin' from the narcos
Keep them bottles comin', we gon' pop 'em till the bar close

There they go
Those d-town boys, carry the calico
Whenever there's war, you gots to know
Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

Meat cleaver, leave a gash in a bitches ass
She had dreams of being an r&b singer
Diva, leave her face cut up from the waist
Of me, what a waste of a pretty face
And this place ain't just safe, its just straight gangster
It ain't just new york or la that bangs no more
There's latin crown kings here, southside folk
Eastside them gangs and nothin' but gang lands and
Spray paint cans and when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancin'
That window rolls down and that trey . 8's dancin'
And them shooters don't miss homie, man they hate chancin'
Its straight for the dome and its vacate fast and
Get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue dodge flashin'
Red and blue lights, no ambulance you got flattened
And this was not supposed to be no detroit anthem
But just so you know if you see them d-boyz passin'

There they go
Those d-town boys, carry the calico
Whenever there's war, you gots to know
Them boys got toys, tear down the front do'
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go

It's  be  cause  of 
these drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do
Be.. cause.. of..
these drugs I do; that's why I do the things, I do

It was like.. whoahh and then the fuckin room started spinnin and shit
And my friend came in he was like, "Yo! Yo! Em! Em!
You puttin that shit up your nose again?"
And I was like, "Naw" nuttin like - everything was just spinnin
I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster n shit
Then I just started laughin and threw up all over the fuckin floor
It's crazy

It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me
do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do

My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it
You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it
It's got the power to get you to do it 
So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did
Cause times like these, got me doin lines like these
Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed
It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does
and is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids

Hey Stephanie  Let's take some ecstasy 
Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next to me
 'Til I'm dead I'm takin blunts to the head
Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead
These mescalines got me sure
that I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour
Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?
Cussin out Interscope 
Fuck it, I was born with half a brain
Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games
You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick
cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit 
The last time I sniffed blow
I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show
Bizarre be smokin a half a pound
Fuckin the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down

It's like, back when I first went on tour
I like, went crazy I was like out of control
And - just was fuckin wasted every night, like
wakin up the next morning like - where the..
Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is goin on
you see what I'm sayin?  I was just like, out of control

These Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin
Eight years old swallowin Anacins, standin over my bannister
Laughin with a chromed out caliber 
The weed that I'm sellin this  look like the back of a tarantula
I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura
Smashin it, after framin a nigga with smack and dust
I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months
Crackin capsules to expand our blunts
I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head
Now I'm lookin like a extra on "Night of the Living Dead"
until they find me on a stretcher
I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester?
This crank'll have me blowin up banks like Uncle Fester

Ahhhh.. watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend
Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines
Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens
Got a Jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings 
Blue pills, and purple mushrooms

Missin since yesterday, perfect just for rape
See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K
Two tabs of X and vitamin C
Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3
Grindin the teeth at the signs of the E
I lost six days at a time in the week
The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom
while D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson
In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic
Barf up my stomach linin, drown in my vomit

 - 2.5X

Cause I like, I always tell people - yknowhatI'msayin like
If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody, yknowhatI'msayin?
Keep that shit to yourself; because if anybody sees that, yknahmsayin
when you're out in the public eye and shit
they're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not
That's why I always tell my friends, knowhatI'msayin but
I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck
I'll probably end up, dyin from this shit one day
Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like
"Eminem dies from, drug overdose" - youknowhatI'msayin? And
And my friends, they ain't no fuckin better, yknowhatI'msayin?
They ain't nothin but influences, bad influences to me, y'know
It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure
That's what it boils down to - and, I give in to it
So do they..

Yo yo yo yo yo 
This is my motherfucking anthem 
To hip hop music 
Cause I'm gonna keep doing hip hop music
until the day that I die 

Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and ouji boards
Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like Tupac's
Jumping off roof tops drunk after I do shots
Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rotts
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizza's, now i got twelve visa's
So tell jesus I'm gonna quit sending when hell freezes

That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over

Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap
I think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap
I go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song
And smoke pot till I get high and i stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced aint, it taste tainted
Your whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like sci-fi t.v
Fuck ICP buy my cd
cause while I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut
telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you
Aint no shame in my game I turn the party out
Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over

Uh, uh uh uh uh
Ah ah ah ah
Uh uh uh uh
Ah ah ah ah
Uh uh uh uh 
Ah ah ah ah  

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof 
The roof comes off 
Until my legs 
Give out from underneath me 

I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

Women Singing:
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight

Verse 1:
I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
The tall shit that will end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carried on my back 
Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it
Baby all I wanna do is swallow one and two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you 
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience

Chorus:
Women Singing:
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight 

Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Verse 2:
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandealous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking cabe of undeserving lime lighters
I think a living never meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talkine that junk like you went black, guarded your back
Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly said it

Chorus:
Women Singing:
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight 

Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Verse 3:
Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece 
of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous 
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire
I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting, with the romantic
Freaking the vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like

Chorus:
Women Singing:
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight 

Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright

Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! 
Please, stop! Fuck! Stop!
Thank God you stopped
Fuck, my fucking On-Star isn't working
I left my fucking phone at home
God, I've been standing out here for like an hour
I'm soaking wet, freezing
Thank you so much
Really, you're a life-saver
What are you doing?
Fucking get away from me
What the fuck?
Fuckin asshole
Get away from me, you motherfucker
Get away
Get away you fuckin' freak
Get away from me
God damn it, fuck
Help me!

When we touchdown

In the Midwest we OK
Everybody know them southern boys love that bass
Atlanta go bananas, Alabama, Louisiana
Mississippi tenekeys, every mothaf*****' state
When we touchdown
Go right from the plane to the range
When we touchdown
On the private plane gettin' brain, till we
Touchdown, eh ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
Wit T.I. and Shady baby we bout to insight a riot
When we touchdown

When we get in town, you know how we getting down
Pull a cling an hop on out, snatch all the freaks then walk on out
I'm livin' what they talkin' bout, shinin' if it dark or not
That 100DX double R, you'll find that in the parkin' lot
You barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this s*** for zone 3
4, 5 and 6 as well as 1, atlanta I'm forever son
Still be on whatever coat, grindin' blowin' heavy smoke
Him you better tell 'em fo, won't hesitate to let him go
They know I put that green light on them haters
Keep on tryin' me I'll put that beam right on ya tater

You don't wanna see T.I.P he irate
Try to keep in a cage but some how he keep escapin'
That's why I be on vacation, Virgin Islands I be takin'
Private planes out to Spain, now keep on flyin' I ain't fakin'
The money ain't a thing, think I'm lyin' your mistaken
You can find long lines, and all kinds of b****** your way
When we touchdown

Welcome to the Midwest, yes
Where the Detroit players, ball like you have no idea
The boy is here
Got the whole place lookin' like its candy painted, ain't it
Like we left the kids at home and just let 'em loose with the crayons
F***, I just hit a jogger
People lookin' like frogger
They hoppin' out the way whenever they see Marshal's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black, permanent marker
And left the rest of the car color cover like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin' but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they're crumpin', the way they're tumbling
I gotta do something
But soon as I hit the carwash, to get the tar off
Then it's right back at it tomorrow
They're like dad, this is in, so get with the trend
This is for the pimps, listenin' to MIMS, nail polish on the rims
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show
So go on with your bad self, just have it back to normal when I
Touchdown

From my arrival, to my departure
I guarantee I put this d-i-c-k in somebody daughter, ey
I still have my way with the ladies across the water
Flew from Paris to Haiti, just some s*** that I thought of
Its ironic kind of s*** that we buy man
Make us psychotic
Threat to corporate America, then why they runnin' from me
How could they be so ignorant look at what hip hop den done
Its allowed us to run a business, we should of made it our money
Got us out the ghettos, relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here, ain't no way you takin' it from me
So excuse me Oprah honey I'm sorry really I promise
But n***** b****** and hoes do exist I'm just bein' honest
But why am I bein' punished why is you so astonished
Now I ain't got a degree just intelligence and abundance
So you ain't gotta like me I know millions folks that love me
Well u can tell how they yellin' and screamin'
An waitin' for me
When I touchdown

I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

Now I'm the one thing, you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves me'my friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, "Screw her!"
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it!
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings

Big Proof, rest in peace dudey, we love you
We just wanna keep makin' you proud, heh

My life is trapped in these lines
That's why I'm packin' these nines
I got a rap I ain't dyin'
That's in the back of my mind
Got a strap made of iron
Can't relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers
'Til I'm snappin' my spine
Natural high, I gotta focus
On these bogus poachers
Lookin' over my shoulder
Proof get it poppin' like show'd a hold up

We nothin' but soldiers!

Slow up!

This gun is loaded!

Roll up!

They beef 'n we leavin' 'em coked up!

If Em say it I spray it
If he will it I kill it
We kilpatrick 'n ill it
Yo Detroit, know I can feel it
Will at this gun on my waist-line
At war we don't waste time
Blow up magic can't take a punch
And Fifty can take nine, BLAOW!
We got schoolcraft here at the Seven-eight and Dexter
I'm up 'n holla spendin' dollas ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes suh', ya texta' is b****
Bet'chya ya flinch when Proof shoot up they crew
And wet ya whole clique

So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick, ha ha!

Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
It's just too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it  for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed will hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that will blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin' every penny it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the president get a face lift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire

Bitch didn't you read the flier?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
 Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My D-J's in a coma for
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip 
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost three hundred dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom

Ay-yo flashback, two feats, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin', nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a 'Stop the Violence' rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin', get your ASCAP-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

Stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cause I'm a loonie
I got a "Yukmouth" and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin' "Kuniva yo yo"
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' 'em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from U-P-S for tryin' to send you a bomb

I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some one's
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
'Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
'Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick

Ha ha, suck my motherfuckin' dick
D-12, dirty motherfuckin' dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre kid
Swifty McVeigh
The Kon Artis
The Kuniva
Dirty Harry
Ha ha, and Slim Shady

A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been last few years
Shit I don't know
But I do know I'm back now 

Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run to now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Dre I'm down here
Under the ground,
Pick me up broken tibias,
Fibias, yea fix me up
Sixty sluts all of them
Dieing from asphyxia
After they sip piss
Through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, box of oxypads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job and I'm back with a black stockin' cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
You can't say that yes he can
I just did faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next of kin
Tell 'em shits about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin lesbian in wet cement
Faggoty faggoty faggoty raggedy Ann and Andy
No, raggedy Andy and Andy
No it can't be, it can't be
Yes it can be
The fucking Antichrist is back, Danny
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville,
Calamity goddamn it insanity pills
Fanny pack filled with Xanax
Through every nook and cranny
Looking for trannies
Milk and cookies
Spilt on my silk negligee, lookie
Razor blades with me
To make you bleed
Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on the table with weed
Slim Shady, shit sounds like a fable to me
Till it jumps out the fucking toilet when you're taking a pee

Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run to now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Six semen samples
Seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot for Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe on canopy beds
And gladbags yeah, glad to be back
Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn what he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in brighton, I ain't enlightened
Biting into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a viking
Oh lightening is striking, might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck jason it's friday the 19th
That means it's just a regular day
And this is the kinda shit I think of regularly
Fuckin' lesbian, shouldn't of had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missing both legs and begging to stay

Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run to now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming
To spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of funions
Mad at me, understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
out of a cannon and have him catapult, add an adult
Captain of a cult, with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a trick or treat holiday
Have Michael Myers looking like a liar
Swipe his powers, replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a forty, stuck a suppository up his ass
And made him tell me a story, gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetables section and gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krugar, and Edward Scissorhands too
Then came out with a little scratch, oh
Looking like I got in a fucking pillow fight, with a triple back goose
Insanity? Can't it be vanity, where's the humanity
In havin' a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
Straight jacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back, then they latch it
Cut your fuckin' head off, and that's where you headed off to
Get it, headed off to? Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic, so's this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco

Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run to now
I'll disappear, they'll wonder how
Lookin' for me, I'm underground

Nah man
Not quite finished yet

Girl I think,
You just might'a tried to pull a muh'fucking fast one, I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling, and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games?
See this saw blade? See the silhouette of a stalker
In your walk-way? Better co-operate
Or get saute'd and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
M-C's get so quiet you can hear a muh'fucking dog whistle while I walk by
'Colt Seavers' on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fucking Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
Cause it will turn into a Gremlin and run over kids, women and men
Vrinn-vrinn! Motor's so big you can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits while you're cringin'
Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
While I spin spin even ten cents on you, since when
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny?
Shit, if I think a penny's pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie meenie miney mo, catch an Eskimo by his toe
While he's trying to roll a snowball but,
Don't make him lose his cool
If he hollers better let him go y'all

Now here we go go go!

Get up! Baby get a move on, 
Like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You will never think of this shit
Yeah, honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I reek it
Evil I see, hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady
Fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every muh'fucking chicken fore' it hatches
Cause, you can bet your ass that we gone get it crackin'
Like a Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in so bad
You gone have Kurt Kobain askin'
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
I'm fashionable and 'bout as rational
As a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it
Don't stand there and look stupid at me bitch
I ain't in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it till it pops up
Y'all are so motherfucking full of shit that you're stopped up
Me I'm always shitting diarrhea of the mouth
Till your speakers crap out, "Ohp, What?"
Girl you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette "Chik-Chigarette"
But you won't get a hot butt Sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut! Because

Here we go go go

And now that I got your panties in a bunch
And your bowels in an uproar
I'm a show you why I Kang Xi
Stop asking me what the fuck for
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore know you want more,
Bitches tell I put the Mat back into Mathers
Cause I'm a fucking problem, Run boy!
Every flow got it mastered
So every last word that you fucking fags heard
Comes straight from the fishes ass, Yeah
In other words I'm a Bass turd!
Looking at me like I killed Kenny
Gassing the tank near steal plenty
No morals are instilled in me
So remorse I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal
Understandable why you're jealous, fucking animal
I got cannibal magnetism, cant resist him now, can ya hoe?
Shady, I don't understand your flow.
Understand my flow?
Bitch I flow like Troy Palumalu's hair, boy.
Don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy.
I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare
Stay the fuck outta my hair, boy!
You can look, you can stare and point
But you can't touch since you're queer boy.
I don't get it man, is there a void
All this weak shit, what am I steroids?
Well bitch I'm back with some shit for that ass
And your trunk, Elephant hemorrhoids

And remember boys
Here we go go go

Thank you for coming out
Hope you enjoyed the show
Till next time

Ha ha

Peace!

Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talked to like, you're just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a

White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it, they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty 'cause we're black
"But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats'
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a Derringer
Or be 'capped in America' like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach Congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the "Land of the Free" that made people slaves to build

Tell yo 'bout Venger
Straight out of Michigan
Slim Shady

Venger is a big fat bitch
He's the biggest bitch I know
And he stinks like shit
Remember back then,
The days when he was skinny?

Yo.

Now he's fat
And he still thinks he's pretty.
He's such a slag
People who smoke grass
Are saying "Shit.
Goddamn, that's a big fat ass"
Fuck that slut
He's a big fat trick
And I still won't suck
His ten foot dick
Slim Shady
I'm a crazy thing
Down with Dr Dre 
With a Darkhaven swing

Yo

I don't know much
But I know this shit
Venger is a big fat bitch

Venger is a big fat bitch
Venger is a big fat bitch
Venger is a big fat bitch
He's a red eyed, stink ass, horn headed bitch

Uh huh
Dr Dre
Check it
My homie Shadow Demon
Lives up the block
He's got a big fat master
Who sucks my cock
Non stop, he's a sight to see
A real evil bitch
Who does right by me
He might be the best slut
In the mountains
Ten times a week
But shit,
Who's countin'?
I'm astounded 'bout the things he does
He used to suck in each,
Fuck in each town there ever was
He ain't a slut
He's a super groupie
And I'd pass that bitch
Around like a doobie
I don't know much
But I know this
Venger's a big fat bitch

Oh shit
Tell 'em, Em

I'm Slim Shady
That name's really cool
I might be a fuck
But I ain't no fool

Uh uh

I just moved from Darkhaven to Boulder
'Cause Venger's trippin' on Kelek's own shoulder
He's just colder 'cause I'm like that
Little freak ass pain
But you know that

Yo

I've been followin' tracks
Like a puppy
Old horn head
Doesn't take shit from yuppies
Word up
I am Slim Shady
To a mother fucking T is the place to be

Yo

I don't know much
But I know this
Venger is a big fat bitch

Well
The dude's right
Dr Dre
Eminem
Best bitch around
Fuck Venger
This goes out to all the fat bitches in the realm
Yo,yo
What's up?
Gotta drink some duff

Yeah! Oh! Get Up! I said get up! Let's go!
Better watch out 
Cause here we come 
And we ain't stoppin' until
We see the mornin' sun 
So give us room to do our thing
Cause we ain't come to hurt no one 
So err'body come on get up on the floor
Right now and grab someone 

Now first of all I'm a boss
I just wanna get that across
Man even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto likes it's a Porsche
Garbage bag on one of the windows
Spray-painted doors with the flames on 'em
Michigan plates and my name's on 'em
Baby, Shady's here come on get him
If you dames want 'em
But he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him?
Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now could I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussy who's the man
Now, get up, dance!

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody!
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party!
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party!

Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Lookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead
And tomorrow I'll prolly still be too high to get outta bed
Til I feel like I been hit wit the sharp part'a the hammer
Mixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot to kill like I'm hollerin' "Die Santa!"
Miss the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryin' ta play the wall like you pawlin'
Get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'
Cause as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'
Makin' it rain for them ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's
From the north, east and west, but when
It comes to them trailers in them South Parks
Muffle it, cause homie that hood's tighter then Kenny's
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
C'mon

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody!
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party!
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party!

Now whether you're black, white or purple
If you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck
You weren't doin' shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil
And you're no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood
Now honey, don't let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot
Cause girl I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift and
Make a five seater
I'll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain't like me to split a piece 'a dry pita
I'll be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground
And flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I'll tell ya now
I'm so raw I still need to un-thaw
You feel me, y'all?
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up!

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody!
Ain't nothin' but a White Trash Party!
So let's have us a little bash
And if anyone asks
If there ain't no one but us trash
You dunno, you better ask somebody
Cause we're havin' a White Trash Party!

Yo, speed racer, 97' burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer
I'm on some low ish, 
I'm fed up wit the being broke ish
I'm not to joke wit
Bitch, I don't sell crack, I smoke it
My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets
Loosing battles to wack rappers 'cause I'm always too blunted
Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, "Who want it?"
Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it
My 9's at your frame,is that your chain? Run it
Who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor?
Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mom's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her
 )
The doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics
I'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you, 
and I'ma make sure you come back for it
So barricade your infants, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses 
..Take em' on long vacation trips
Kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit )
Mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone
I'm so high, I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber
I'm sick of the crap, what's Dr. Kevorkian's phone number? 

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes 

Why, are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flying trapeze
Into the dark, I plummet
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark's high
Butter-flies rip apart my stomach
Knowing that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna hark, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow
So I scrap these, as pressure increases, like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers disc set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect, I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hitting the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen, and pick it apart
Like, "this shit is garbage"
God's given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me like as a God, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try to not listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are trying to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, Pac, Big, James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water 
But only when it freezes 

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh

It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doing my best to not ruin your expectations 
And meet 'em, but first, the "Speedom" verse
Now, Big Sean, he's going too fast
Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eating out my palm
Every album, song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm getting clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's Deshaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question, though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home is burnt to the ground
And all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtains drawn
They're closing the set, I'm still poking my head out from behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I, ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around 'cause

I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes

'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown

'Cause I'm just a man, but as long as I got a mic I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote "Stan"

It's Fifty A-K-A Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it

You said you a gangster but you never pop nuttin'
We said you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't a friend of mine 
You ain't no kin of mine 
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with the nine
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and copy and go selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
A a** like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm f***ing with they mind
I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme
Been on parole since ninety-four 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did it three to nine
If D's ran up in my crib, you know who dropping dimes

You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing

You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing

Damn Homie, in high school you was the man, homie
What the f*** happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the chedda
And if you play with my paper, you gotta meet my berretta
Now shorty think I'm a sweat her, sipping on amaretto
I'm living once than deada, I know I can do better
She look good but I know she after my chedda
She tryna get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gonna let her
Be easy, stop the bulls***, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doin' the same ol' two step
Guerrilla unit cause they say we bugged out
'Cause we don't go nowhere without toast we thugged out

You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing

You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing

Me I'm no mobsta, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no acta
But it's me you see on your TV
'Cause I hustle baby, this rap s*** is so easy
I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
N****s saying they going murd' Fifty, how?
We riding 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about A-Ks and are fifteens?
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and F-bangs, huh

You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing

You said you a gangsta
But you never pop nothing
We said you a wanksta
And you need to stop frontin'
You go to the dealership
But you never cop nuttin'
You been hustling a long time
And you ain't got nothing

Remix, Lloyd banks, ha ha

It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
It's like a joke, he's like a king, but he don't rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold, don't want the jewelery

He don't want the fame, don't want the loot, he's in it for the sport
Runnin' circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin' for it
And you can love it, you can hate it but you can't ignore it

You can't be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin' then you better come confront me for it

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain, yeah
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Your stomach's ache while he's loungin' at the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand with a nigga's skate

House's with just a bigger gate, houndin' him is a big mistake
He won't surrender, he'd rather give up a rib to break
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand
So he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan

Created a buzz so that you gotta mention his name
When you discussin' the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them
G Unit records ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit you're corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's no magician man, he can't make sometin' outta nuttin'
So now niggaz from his hood act like he owe 'em somethin'
They talk crazy 'til he send niggaz to where they buck 'em
Ask 'em if it's a problem and he'll say na it's nothin'

He's was gonna help 'em out, but since they fronted, fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate 'em or love 'em
He hold his own on his own the kid is really thuggin'
He's rich now, he ain't changed so niggaz think he buggin'

He bulletproof everything 'cuz niggaz try to buck him
Keep two pistols on his hip, I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch 'em slippin', they creepin' and start bustin'

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

I can give you niggaz somethin' you can talk about
I can turn you're smile upside down
You ain't no G, you're a fuckin' clown
I can take your girl a turn and turn her out

Don't hold it in, let it all out
I can give you fuckas somethin' to be mad about
Invite her in, send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth

I hit harder
than Forman
landing both both gloves to a low blow
with no cup
leave you Speech-less like when Arrested Development broke up
carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
crack skulls
through helmets
with the penetration of a screw nailed in
return like I was sending self addressed postage
throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
before battles, we pour blood
and toast, death to wicked infants
found on the sorceress' doorsteps
slaughter lamb
and boar's head
every MC's cause of boredness
and mind bondage
bronchitis, lung failure
language unfam-i-liar
art through a flooded air brush
??? leave craft
sentences joined with words holding hands
it's a tight squeeze
from where your head will be landing
in exact time flight leaves

Verse Two :
Who's arm is this?
I must have cut it off of the pharmacist
and refused to renew my seventh prescription of darvocets
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
and never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life
that's why I degrade my wife
grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich
and just ate the knife
my mother's screaming 'please heal him, take him straight to Christ'
meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
made a bomb threat with a fake device
strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
and if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'
I was probably just tryin to shake the lice
bugs fallin' out of my head
I'm wishin' I was dead
while I'm crawlin out of my bed
found it red
and my rash is returning
I feel the sensation of burning
occurring, usually during pain for release in my urine
screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'
these pills keep screamin' 'please quit swollin' me'
the devil keeps screamin' 'please get down on one knee'
took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me

Ladies and gentleman
You are now about to witness the strength
Of Aftermath straight out the mothafuckin streets of Compton
Put your hands together for Game bitch
Hahahaha
Yeah mothafuckas
Compton's back on the mothafuckin map
Aftermath in that ass bitch
Game let's go

Me and Marshall ain't start shit they listen to our shit
They talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But its hard when they hate us and think 'Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them
Shady one of the greatest like Biggie n' Pac was
We saw the throne was empty and decided to chase it
Me, him and 50 racin' this rap shit is basic I followed that Jay shit
Thinkin what I wanna say, step in the booth in one take and
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical LA, NWA shit
The media is bullshit now we can't even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired this black shit this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this

So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame
Bitch you're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face
Which- way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving in my face
Looking for answers, rap sensation Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted
The Mask of Jason was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting too much time
Me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then we ain't going

So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

Low get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em' just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 mile, startin' to get home sick
I'mma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is anybody armor under the Pendleton
These niggas is killing it take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For tellin me its hot when its not and you got what you got
From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin Dre you got shot
With a Glock that don't phase me
I'm crazy why the fuck you think I'm rhyming with Shady ?
I don't care if the radio don't play me
I say what I say when I feel like I'm feelin today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks

So I'm gone bitch

So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day 

Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn niggaz' moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggaz' vibes
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggaz, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
Ho's in animal skirts get mirked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
Trust in "God"? It's 'cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggaz up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day 

But as long as I'm here, I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty will make your ass bet on words
Touch niggaz in jail make them wanna finish their last set
They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case, then get a bigger one
You don't think I'm packed to pump cause I'm out of the hood
That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
Cop rings like Mike, Larry, Magic and them
Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds, you don't see me in the train
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, cause I ain't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain's soft 

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day 

We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gon' get it
Name 'em we gon' hit em, chew em up and spit em out
HRRK-PTT
Too much venom, and if you roll with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode, soon as you go to step in 'em 
You know how we do it, when we do, how we do it, when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie, we all move like assassins
Ski masks and gloves Consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask be Real
We burn source covers like fuckin' Cypress Hill
Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, "you better believe the hype is real"
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin "P.O." choke
I'm an OG you fuckin with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a Vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people
At San Ysidro Ranch, huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back, or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and indo
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco, esse?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Sha "D" in the "Dy" is for "deez nuts"
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months I'm having an E party for Easter, please come squeeze guns

We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gon' get it
You name 'em, we gon' hit em, chew 'em up and spit em out
Too much venom and if you role with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a 12 gauge Mossberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around you know how I get down
I watch gangster flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before the end cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns, I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fiendin' to touch something
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fiendin' to cut something
See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her, then the bitch don't know me

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day 

There's an intruder
in my house
He cut my phone-lines
can't dial out
I scream for police
but I doubt
They're gonna hear me
when I shout

A couple of cocktails will send me to jail
there's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
there's a doberman pincher and a pitbull in the seat
these pigs 'll get bit fooling with me
quit fooling with me
Bitch, you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat
why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
and which you're gonna see in the long run
Im'a be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass
flashin that flash-light on my ass where was you at
last night when them assholes 
ran up on my grass
rapper slash actor
kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
they took away my right to bear arms
what I'm posed to fight with bear palms?

but you know who
whith an "s" tatooed to my chest
But I've innested
Now I got the Industry pissy
eversince me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty it's funny
We got a buzz spreading quicker than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead
It's never been said 
but I said precedents and their standards
and they can't stand it
My name should've been bastard
the shit should've been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap pulled in my ass
but I'm too swift and fast 
for that one, im past it 
I'm too old to and cruise grass shit
Fuck that shit

I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans either side of my penis
under my Long Johns 
under my Sean Johns
when running with the long arm or the long long gone
Im'a do five years no less than that
no questions asked
it might be a good idea to stop right here

A target on my back

Bin Laden on my ass

Guess who? You miss me?
Jessica Simpson sing the chorus, Jessica Simpson

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me 
You're the one they adore, who they came to see 
You're a, rock star 
Everybody wants you 
Player, who can really blame you 
We're the ones who  made you

Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac or ant'-acid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic, is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man no don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashians a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive Gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then Squish it, then pass it to her friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can
Yes he can, can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a two, you're practically a ten
I know you want me girl, in fact I see your grin 

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me 
You're the one they adore, who they came to see 
You're a, rock star 
Everybody wants you 
Player, who can really blame you 
We're the ones who  made you

The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie Horse her
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Excedrin
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, 'Baby say hello to my little friend'
Brit forget K-Fed let's cut off the middle man
Forget him or your gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl pay them little attention
A little did I mention, that Jennifer's in
Love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me 
You're the one they adore, who they came to see 
You're a, rock star 
Everybody wants you 
Player, who can really blame you 
We're the ones who made you

And that's why, my love, you'll never live without,
I know you want me girl cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you
Damn girl I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that's bad you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put a breast in my mouth
Wowzers, I just made a mess of my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Lord help us he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's about to flip
Jessica rest assure, Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate 

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me 
You're the one they adore, who they came to see 
You're a, rock star 
Everybody wants you 
Player, who can really blame you 
We're the ones who made you

So baby, baby, get down, down, down

Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down

Oh Amy, Rehab never looked so good,
I can't wait, I'm going back! Ha ha woo! Dr. Dre, 2020, yeah

Shady, we're back!

Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think you the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the radi'
O, and they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends, which has amazed me
'Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big'ba'big'big bay'ba'baby

So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryna get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin' the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so

Shady  we're back!

This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed
My kids would it fulfill all my family needs 
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I receive
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "suck my dick"
Take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin' shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin', where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? Drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns own, Aftermath, Shady!

Shady! we're back!

Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't write yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'til I show I
Go out on a limb with Em 'cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin' me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin' through the track nigga

Shady! 

I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the Shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in the Midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin' weight from MS 13
With S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Prozac, D's and E-Pills, it's a wrap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back nigga

Shady!

And gangsta been bangin' the underground since '95, we're bangin'
Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame

So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fucks with us

Throw them hands up and show some love

You know, it's gonna be what its gonna be

Ruff Rydas

Welcome to D Block, the city of broke down dreams
With things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers,
Pin handlers Hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun don't shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
'Cause every cities got a ghetto and every ghetto got a hood
Take a good look around you 'cause there's a D Block near you

Place where ain't no body that proud, it's a fucking black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Word get around though, see if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
Five minutes flat the whole town know
Lot of assuming a niggas salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body is a technicality
Other than that catch em and Clinton on a gallery
The determination and dedication of discipline
Listening and catching the jewels you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the haters gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but the older they get,
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick,
We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say 'em exquisite,
Anytime you can pay us a visit

Welcome to D Block, the might mighty D Block
The place in New York City where Diddy won't even walk
Its D Block, the part of Yonkers where I wouldn't be caught
Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
D Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walking,
Stick up kids every block who walks with that free op-
Portunity, as soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you won't even notice your mind will be so preo-
Occupied on that new watch you just copped
You won't even see that ride pull up along side you
You'll be shot fore you even realize you were spied over three blocks
D Block the place where G's get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked
You don't even see cops, hip hop police don't even stop,
On D Block, where everybody wants to be Pac
And you can get popped over the new G-Unit Reeboks

This the beat you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
My bad almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick, head of the Goon Squad
And gangsta, been bangin' the underground since 95 we're bangin
Elected to be the villain, and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled, up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you'd ever see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain

So its evident, its time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fanbase thats bigger than the average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine

Hahahaha
Welcome to Detroit
Come back soon!
Sorry we missed you
TRICK TRICK!

I'm like a white Michael Vick, psycho enough to stick
Michael J. Fox in a microwave with a Rott
I might make a little Aliz' with a side of Nyquil
And ride a motorcycle bike right through the side of my high school
Satan's disciple with a sniper rifle and a knife and a white diaper
Liable to shit on you while I snipe you
So dope he gets off opiates, what an appropriate
Way to start off his day; he may just smart off to Dre
He may be hard to contain cause his rage is so hard to gauge
See Hannibal ate off his face and made Jason gnaw off his leg
Amazing hard-on for razors and blades and anything sharp
Even poisonous darts; It all plays a major part of his game
Holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick
He's so sick, it's ridiculous; sawed the crazy part off his brain
He's still insane, why's there bloodstains on his carpet man?
There's some crazy shit going on in Shady's apartment again

Newsflash, I'm still trashed, those pills should have killed my ass
But they didn't, they just made me stronger
It's like they re-built my ass
Like the Six-Million-Dollar-Man after the crash
It's Aftermath bitch! And my milk-glass is still half-empty
Yeah, tempt me! Hell isn't enough 
They need to invent somewhere new to send me
As sick as I'm getting, they'll stick me in a conventional oven
With a rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating
Shit, I done laid a verse, said some foul shit
Tried to go back, fix it, fucked around, and just made it worse
Yeah, I'm back, looking no worse for wear, got these haters
Mad enough to rip out their hair, start punching the air
Panties so in a bunch, they can't function
It's Shady and Royce, fuck yeah
What a dysfunctional pair
So stop acting like a punk get a pair
Take a pill and fall the fuck out, spill your lunch in the chair

I'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash Kim Kardash in the ass
With a shard of glass from Nick Hogan's car crash
You'll end up like the passenger of that, don't be a smartass
Yeah, laugh while you sit there thinking the hard part passed
You ain't seen pain till Leatherface flips man
I'll cut your fucking balls off, homie, my saw's off the chain
I chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs
And the top half of her torso fucking crawled off insane
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to Mike Jack's
Took the Elephant Man's skull, fucked it, and put it right back
Handed my dick to Bubbles while he sucked it and licked my nutsack
Gave him a reach around while I fucked him right in his buttcrack
Nah, I ain't taking it back faggot, fuck that
I give a fuck about nothing so here's where you fucked up at
Don't go touching that can man, you don't wanna open up that
Wait a min'Ah shit'Alchemist, cut that

Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab sticky right quick

Hey yo stick, stick

Yo slim shady
Yo I just had like a nightmah
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah
Well it wasn't a good 
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man 
Yo, yo I dreamt I was white! 

If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - if - he - was - white?
What if he was white?
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?

Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as cocaine?
Blond hair, blue eyes, the whole shibang
I know one thing; police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me 

The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn't need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
Security wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something 
Because I'm black I rob and automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white I wouldn't of thought o.j. was innocent 

If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? 
What if he was white, white,  white, white, he was white 
What if he was white?
What if he was 
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? 

What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - if - he - was - white?
What if you were white? 
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white  
White, white, white, white, white?

If I was white
It would be a different world for me
If I was white  what shade would I be? 
Would I be redneck or skinhead, preppy or high class?
You probably live in a trailerpark and be white trash!
In any case that be the ill shit right? 
But there's a good and bad side of being white
You can't say the n word without startin a fight 
Couldn't dance to a beat, I'd have two left feet
Even if I was white plaque still have a ghetto shit 
Is it a myth or do I really have a little dick 
If I was white, I would probably listen to hard rock
And cover my ears when ever I heard hip hop 

If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? 
What if he was white, white,  white, white, he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? 

What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white 
What if he was white? 
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? 

Yo, yo, yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I'd watch tennis and golf and bet on hockey games 
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
And there probably would of never even been an onyx, shit
I be serice sippin vodka and tonix
Smokin on a marlboro instead of a newport
Id live in long island instead of new york
If I was white, I probably couldn't dunk
'cause everybody knows white man can't jump 
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spot
'cause all of the dreads would think I'm a cop

If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - if - he - was - white? 
What if he was white
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?

What if you were white?
What if he was white?
What - if - he - was - white?
What if he was white?
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
If he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white

What - if - he - was - white?

White, white, white, white, white, white,

White, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
White, white, white, white, white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?

Yo, what if I was white?  uh

True professional 2...

Now that Bush is president n**** we all through

Wooooooooooord!

It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
Why I keep on duckin' under the bed when I hear thunder
'cause I ain't crazy, I say s*** that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that! I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, there'll be just as many muthaf***in' murderers
And heroin users without Marlilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just want to be there when you do it!
Now the parents are suein' 'cause little Darren is screwin'
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new s***
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is f***ed up
'cause of me? Two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'f*** it' like Pac's was at one point
want to come join? Pick up a glock and just point
Now everybody's killin' everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughin' like it's funny
Cause I don't really give a s*** about no-muthaf***in'-body
I'm so muthaf***in' nutty I don't give a f*** about nuttin'!

My wrist is...water and freeze
And mix this is...audio Jesus the repent s*** gets big
Keep it sharp like knife in a pop device
So "Duro you gotta let it bump!", I came from a hard knock life
They say this kid be rude like this can't be true 
I suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down I'm still wylin'
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock City baby knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all-a my dogs wit' me
And they all rich, and still all-a they palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walkin' like we talkin' drunk while we stumble over words
Clue *inhale*...Duro *inhale*...Slim *inhale*...Meth *inhale*...
Five *inhale*...Nine *inhale*...Hold up *inhale*...breath

It's just...Mr. Meth and DJ Clue
I ain't crazy, I just do what the beats say do

It's just...Slim Shady and DJ Clue
I ain't evil, I just do what the beats say do

Unnh..Royce 5-9 and DJ Clue
I ain't bad, I just do what the beats say do..unnh...

*kiss noise*

DJ Clue!
Desert Storm!
Come oooooooon maaaaaaaan! *echoes*

So this is it
This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert

I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no where for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it

Every CD critics gave it a three, then three
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorce, re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, and I can still walk

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I got a letter from a fan, that said
He's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you at least

A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit

So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

I said

Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold

Haha, swifty mcvay! 
Mr. porter, the kon artis 
I told you we wasn't leavin, c'mon! 

I come from a jungle, with a trunk load of punk hoes 
Muzzle this animal, f*** with mechanical
Gun totin hazardous cutthroat, cantaloupe can split it
And the pope couldn't prevent me from s***tin on n****z
Fitted caps get blew back like bad wind, imagine backspinnin'
Into a casket, it happens when bastards try to act masculine 
A hell raiser, I smack the skin off your man's face
So fast it'll leave acne on my hand when it land 
Placed in a cla** where professors came to school with smith 'n wessons
Just to teach us a lesson, had that a** hangin' up with the flag 
Parental discretion, I'll send you a video
With me naked havin a session on my urinal 
When you kill in the nighttime and claimin' yo' innocence
I'll be waitin' ready to a. K. you and yo' egg bene-dick {ahh! }
Usin' yo' balls to play tennis with 
You'll be in some s*** like flies and f*** the witnesses

 n****z that doubt and thought we wasn't killin' s***
 whatever you want, we providin' it diligently
 double barrel wherever we go willingly
 on opposition in the streets or industry

You was born I was hatched, but you came out deformed
I have nuts of a horse, and you ain't got no balls
Come runnin' with tec-9's whenever n****z would call
Bang-bang-bang, bang-bang, shoot up cla**way halls
I don't give a f***, who you call to come
You came with thirty n****z, I only came with one
That just goes to show you how much scrap a n**** got in me
You gone off henny, that liquid courage drivin you into these
Situations you in, don't get that "purple pills" s*** confused
With us bein cool up here singin "my band"
I'm sure you see these little kids cryin over me man
They'll do anything for a f***in autograph
So say that s*** loud enough out of the f***in crowd and
I'll show you the meanin' of die-hard fans
Saddam hussein who sews, who radical act
A mechanical bomb attached to my pelvis
That's what I mean by get, back; I mean get, back
Or find your head detached from that mitchell and ness
So find your spinal cord, uh-uh-oh I digress
I guess I'm just too fresh, to finish that line
Denaun's ain't next

Yeah, it's my life
My own words, I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much
You'd give an arm for
Not the expression, no
Literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
"Daddy look what I made"
"Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy where's mommy?
I can't find mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself"
I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

I keep havin' this dream
I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'"
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, daddy you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "you got one more chance to do right
And it's tonight, now go out and show 'em that you love 'em before it's too late"
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'"
But baby we're in Sweden
How did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you daddy
You told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"
"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want
They want you, Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!
You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real"
I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Cock it, put it to my brain, scream "die Shady!" And pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up
Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Music, reality, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
Or would it matter
Can never be the lead-off batter of things
Shit for me to feed off
I'm see-saw battling
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for? A joke? You smoking crack?
Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back
I get up 'for I get down, run myself in the ground,
'For I put some wack shit out
I'm trying-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
You all steady trying to drown the shark
Ain't gonna do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull the piece out,
Fuck shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap
Yo slim, you're gonna let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him 'scape with that
Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,
This is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh
If so you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey,
Got drunk then I finished he
I'm every niggas favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently

I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I murder you
Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'll allergic to dying, you think not? You got balls? We can see how large
When the music stops
I was happy having a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worst,
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
When you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with they hands out
Checking for your record when its selling
When it ain't, that's the end, no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin you drink till your car spin, you think
Damn!

You slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up looking for you
With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode
With red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you
Niggas, if I was you niggas, I'll run while given the chance
Understand I can enchance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really
Irks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, fuck the tour and the mic
I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like
You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night

When the music stops
Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors
You all don't want war, you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
The more you all breach, the more I moves
This hill street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels 
Or make the news betcha all you all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
Music's changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N-W-A said fuck the police

Now I'm in jail
93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up hair cut
Listen to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike
Ass cheeks painted white
Fucking Priscella at night
Flying down sunset smoking crack
Transvestite in the front
Eddi Murphy in the back
M-O-P had me grimey and griddy
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue
And grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bow's
Now I'm in the hospital
Broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock,
I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops

I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought
Standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on

White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get

Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
If they were brown
Shady lose
Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby 
Look at myself!
Let's do the math
If I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so fuck school
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the fuckin' studios at
When I was underground
No one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like "Fuck it"
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
I'm like "My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?"

White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much muthafuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped
When they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like
"I dont like this, no!"
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say fagot
Shit,
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal
A poster child
The muthafuckin' spokesman now for

White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get
White America!
I Could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to T-R-L, look how many hugs I get

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney
Fuck you tipper Gore
Fuck you with the free-ness of speech this
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you!

Ha ha ha! I'm just playin' America, you know I love you

I never knew I
I never knew I
Mic check one-two
I never knew I

Who woulda knew?
I never knew I
Who'da known?
I never knew I

Fuck who woulda thought?
I never knew I
Motherfucker comes out
I never knew I

And sells a couple of million records
I never knew I
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
I never knew I

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this 

Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?

Oh you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out, and turn em around?
Look, I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out

 I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up

Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
 But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You should of been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

So who's bringin' the guns in this country? 
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row,
Screamin' "Go" with their 17-year-old Uncle
I'm like, "Guidance, ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?"
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the makeup you allow your 12 year old daughter to wear?
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse

And fuck was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird 
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like 
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night, Ike
So how much easier would life be
If 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

I never knew I, knew I'd
Have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop 
Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin' some trees 
How many retards will listen to me
And run up in the school shootin' when they're pissed at a
Teacher, her, him, is it you is it them?
"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!"
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you would of been
If you would of been, in my shoes, who would of thought
Slim Shady would be somethin' that you would of bought
That would of made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not

'Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch

How the fuck was I supposed to know?

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an
Eighty degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see, the b****'s hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism

The devil ain't on the level same as him
Just someone who rebels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving him an adjective an a** whooping
So bad they should put his a** in prison
I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally
Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap

Cadillac from a K Car, my a** from a hole in the ground, still can't tell em apart
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a f*** I don't play!
You think you saw this basket first?
Yeah backwards like motherf***ing Bob and Silent Jay
Illest s*** you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?
With a gaping hole in it
Whip out, whip down

Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray
But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scalar
Being gay little faggot but by the way
Plus it's getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent Jay

It's a f***ing miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face, I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, a**aults you like an ultra violet ray
I'm sellin' hatred buffet style all the s*** you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm s***tin' on the competition
In the meantime it's always mean time

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I've been a career a**hole
I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much f***ed up s***, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this s***
And I'm coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
That cougars a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'm a snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed would have caught a flat

If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it
Indigestion my suggestions's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
Its 'cause I am don't speculate spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace
'Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase

'Cause baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me I think my face is melting
If you felt these migrains, see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-empty hole in my empty head
If you read my mind you can see my pain
And you could see why I'd be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Or shut the P-I-E hoes that peep my game

'Cause I'm about, like a f***in' echo
Psycho on a cycle
If I hear Iko
I'm out of control like no
Other mike-o, stab you to the nightpost
Nothing but a hole inside your skull where you eye close
'Cause I'm gonna sock it to you, dyko, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it, like a motorbike
I'm gonna blow the mike the whole night so strike up the f***in' maestro, I'm like nitro
And heigh-ho, hand me my shovel I'm libel to dig my hole deeper
It's off to H-E double hockey sticks I go

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I want to dig my way to hell
I want to dig my way to hell

Oh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God
S***.
It's a girl
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a c*** in mouth and get my balls blew out
And gay into the A.M
And lay with eighteen guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
But f*** it, suck from the tucket
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body

Who is that? Where are you going? Mm come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? F*** you then
Blow it out your a**

Obie Trice
Real name no gimmicks

Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside,
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside,
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back, guess who's back?
Guess who's back?

I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, then this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that will jump start my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating 
You waited this long to stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem is complicating
So the F-C-C won't let me be or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on M-T-V
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, "Fuck you, Debbie!"

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells "Bitch!"
A visionary, vision is scary,
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the air waves, a rebel
So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
"Testing attention please"
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A-tiskit a-taskit,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over,
Nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly 
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey, there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerged
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

And smokes purp' does a word search gets circles wrapped around him like
You do when I come through, I'd like you to remind yourself
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
Or your the kind of girl that I can take a liking to
Sike I'm spiking you like a football
Been this way since I've stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Gotta pretty mouth and a good jaw
Gimme good brain
Watch the wood grain, don't want no cum stain
Bitch you listening tryna' turn me down
Slut I'm talking to you, turn me back up
Are you insane tryna talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shits playin'
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
Whats the saying? Where there's thunder there's light-ening
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations
On four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stanking ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road took the psychopath
Poison ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
So hit the dance floor cutie while I do my duty on this microphone
Shake your booty shawty I'm the shit
Why you think Proof used to call me Doodi

You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no I won't back down
Oh no

My words are weapons, I use them to crush my opponents
These words are weapons, I never show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use them to kill who ever's steppin' to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

The rage I release on a page, is like a demon unleashed in a cage
Lunatics soon as i hit the stage, my mind is like a fuckin' stick of dynamite
Once I get behind a mic its like the wick is lit 
You bitches die tonight, my nine inch dick shinin' bright
My fuckin' grip is tighter than my wifes vagina
These cock suckin' cops got my Smith and Western
I guess its time to pick a different weapon, man this shits depressing.
But swift gettin' me a new one for a Christmas present
Come on slim lets go and teach this fuckin' bitch a lesson
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I ?
But the plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage.
Shady stay creative baby, hold your head up don't you let ?
One bit on these motherfuckin' suckers, your a soldier get up 
Stand up for what you believe in, as long as you breathin' 
They jealous of you man that the only reason they beeffin'

Its that Dirty dozen renegade, who done pulled the pin outta my grenade
38's so move your shit up out the way, you niggas won't forget about Mcvay 
You got summit to say let it out today or watch these bullets spray from these ten black fingers Huggin' these deadly mm's make Jeff domers think he caught a mistameaner,
See I'm dirty so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater don't lemme see you wid your heater you gets wet wid it,
Tell the motherfuckers Swift did it, packin' summit special in your crib, bitch get it,
Physically fitted to run your digits, I'm pastel with this rascal pointin' up your nostrils
You can split it and guess what we blowin' up the hospital
We wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe, I'm Hannibal Lector
This vinal cord disconnector findin' whores to lock them up in motels to inject her

I'm eatin' crews like I'm Hannibal 
There's no way I could be the gay rapper  I only fuck animals
Stupid trick got my dick startin' to itch
Went to my mothers grave site and called her a stupid bitch
One on One in this blunt sport
I'm in divorce court 
Suein' my bitch over a pack of newports
Six times I've been arrested 
How would you feel if you were a Jehovah's Witness and always gettin' molested
I'm smokin' dank and drinkin' drink, I can't have any kids 
Cause I'm fuckin' shootin' blanks
Don't you know Bizzare don't give a fuck
Nicole's a whore I'm glad OJ murdered a slut, responsibility I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, how could Richard Simons beat the president
Call me a weirdo, call me bizarre, I stick it up your ass while you shit diarrhea

What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved. Not in a religious sense; but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throw-away children.

We seem to be approaching an age of the gross.

We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better.

Alright, come on, let's cut the bullshit enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to basement
And we can discuss statements thats made on this tape
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
The music we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
Crossin 8 Mile into Warren into hick territory
I'd like to share a story, this is my story and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, and I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Ok there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a past I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks

So, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Come on, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

I'd roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and Van Dyke
And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park that was the halfway mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mamma's on chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
Thats about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborne handin' out some flyers
He was doin some talent shows at Centerline High,
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind,
Shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

So, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Come on, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool till your man MC Shan came through
And said that Pumas the brand cuz the clan makes troops
It was rumors but man god damned they flew
Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land, suede too
And we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X clan debut
Professor X "Vanglorious, exists in a state of red, black, and green
With a key sissies"
now with this bein a new trend
We don't fit in crackas is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butter would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showin 'em off not knowin at all
We was bein laughed at you ain't even half black
You ain't posed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flava Flav clock we gon' have to snatch that
All I remember is meetin back at Mannix's basement
Sayin how we hate this,how racist but dope the x clan's tape is
Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool cuz I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gon' say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize 
I was wrong  cuz no matter what color a girl is she still a soul.

let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

Shady! Yeah

Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you do know but you actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know

You do know but actin' like you don't know

Now homie I say I run  it 'cause I'm in control
Hypnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patron
I have you feelin' aight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin' shorty said she's comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga you front you gon' get it, ok now maybe I said it
'cause I want you triddip, yeah I be on that shiddit
You should see when I'm stuntin' I flash the stones that be wantin'
Push the whip see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know The Units the game
I got my grimy Shady with me
You front you'll have to get me off your ass

You know, you actin' like you don't know

When me and Fif' got together to do this music then move it
We became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemisis is su nemisis
The same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honour, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoevers holdin' the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady After-mizz-ath back in that ass, you izz-ass
Come hizzon what kinda fizz-uckin' position is that

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', JFK
HK to your chest plate
Cave out and ride till the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'm a be a Shady 7-4 Gangster
Plus I survived everything you got in that chamber
I thrived off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad called me

Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa-queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin'' G
I'm a hold a 'matic, when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho
This flow is gon' bring more dough
You do know but actin' like you don't know

You know what this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath,
Lloyd Banks, Cashis, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50,
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Talk of Tony Yayo, go

The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days alone, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors, on Dre's Phantom believe me clowns
That means suicide homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me
Bitch I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards homie
And the balls in my court and it's lonely
On top of the world when you're the only
One with the balls and your shorts
To leave them jaws on the floor with no re-
Morse, remember that when they get to doggin' you boy homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop the saga
Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi, I'm moppin' the floors
With them, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won't be, long til this sport is O-V-
E-R, just blazin' and we knockin' them doors and no we
Ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days alone, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
And it don't stop 
And it don't quit 
And it don't stop 
And it don't quit 
And I miss you 
I just miss you 
I just miss you 
Homie I'll never forget you 

For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit hisself
Tap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Yeah it's the best thing I could do right now for you Doodi is to rap
So I'm a fuck til I die, yeah I'm a do it to death
And itstead of mourning your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'm a need two mics
Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finished the rhyming and bust it and excuse the corny metaphor
They'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game, pacin' these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'm a show 'em, blow 'em out the water slaughter 'em homes
I'm on so many bells the only place they can hit me is below
Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same with you
I woulda never came in this game, I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up and spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me nah Doodi you're not layin' on that table I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said think of Hailie, I knew
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doodi

The days are cold livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days alone, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
And it don't stop 
And it don't quit 
And it don't stop 
And it don't quit 
And I miss you 
I just miss you 
I just miss you 
Homie I'll never forget you 

One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four

Out the gate I brought the horsepower
Rev-Mex to your hard drive
We run a hard bargain
Pardon the trip

I sneeze jealousies into these rhyme cartel
We park the art well
Hung on all fours, box and start sell
Available to you and yours

Other songs only make attempts
To love they inner
Understand I am just saying it
To validate displaying Ozomatli

Stance at first glance
It's like the train
Brought to hit you like James
With the 1, 2, 3, 4

True martial arts
Official souls my brainchild
Sing the song name now
1, 2, 3, 4

Bust a track till they flat on they back
Have the referee smacking the mat like
1, 2, 3, 4

We do it on the phone
When we stuff the funk in it, huh

Now wait a minute, so allot of us
Yo, I'm the East Coast south paw
Hanging with these West Coast north stars
Shining bright, height five elev'

Come on

Formatic for the handlin' the trouble
Comin' my way
The highway to heaven
Is a long road among the lyrical coves
The bus

Allot of us
Punk minds with the one of a kind rhymes
I .M.C., spit, kick for fee
Then all, not the player baby
But I running while you crawl

Too fast on your comprehension
Did I mention
Dave Madden scored a goal from the team
Second team I

I'm ready for crunch time
The lunch line was my favorite
Till I graduated to bus
Uh, uh, then I spewed to spit it

Now it's the three of us
Connected like Siameses
We on time
Like shiny bits of metal

Strapped to your wrist
We are tattoo to this rap thing
With invisible ink
I'm gone in a blink

Lethal like my pinkie
And clown like Bozo
Don't you know that Ozo bring the
1, 2, 3, 4

To hard to face
But lovin' the taste
Squeeze it out like paste alright
1, 2, 3, 4

Plug 2 will only rock a few
So now I roll with Ozomatli crew
Bringing you
1, 2, 3, 4

We know the backs to break
Ozomatli the great
Bring it
1, 2, 3, 4
1, 2, 3, 4

Smoothed out without the r and b
 come on!
 come on y'all!
 come on!
There's no r and b in this song
So come along fly children come along
Come along fly children come along
Come along fly children come along
There's no r and b in this song!

Pushed up a dame by the name of crystal
Who flaunts to the point just like a missile
A habit wit ear kiddin' wit gold mags
And since she fancies facial hair she asks my name

Now ever so fab I said I'm wala
Miss wild who used to run tough wit koala
She was a winner of my metaphor and she knew that
I said I'm gonna feed your mouth she said you do that
Now crystal stops the jeep I think I'm mad fly
She used to have a man wit lots of mad signs
Her strut was guaranteed to make a gay smile
And in bed she had proved to be real agile
I show her to the lounge and I dined her
Then she gave me some digits where I could find her
I licked her like a stamp
Laid and sticked her like a champ
But the um she gave me burn
I had to go see the doctor

 skeezer skeezer skeezer

Well it was thirty after nine and I was loungin'
Tokin' on some smoke that I was poundin'
I rang up seven up so we can skip to the mall
Thinkin' a good day to shop
But then we got stopped
A shooter man said "yo this is a stick up"
A whole lot of dirt was 'bout to kick up
I had screens in my pocket
And man, tonight's my date
Wit smokey sue, now what was I to do?
In my head I'm thinking, 'should I dodge the bullet?'
'man this kid is bluffin' you can pull it'
I feared the whole scene
The shooter didn't bluff
Now look at me now
He shot my ass dead

Skeezer skeezer skeezer

Come on, yeah

Yo I'm from l I fella, vison had you tune into my figgida

Microphone is mobile
Holding mic's is so while I be just day dreaming
Drop for like, nine months, and rock from backyards to
Fronts
Who wants to live the gutter life, we got sidewalks to walk,
Baby
I need a chick with big potatoes to mash, baby
Hang like parachutes, I've been floating for years
Went from rapping in cars to rapping careers
One beer, two beers, I got the gift like santa
I go from ny to dc, and down to atlanta
Make you fly like propellor, we be down in the cellor
What I guess you call the basement, cause thats where all
The bass went
When we turn it up a notch, old school like ed kotch
Toss my foot up in the air and grab my crotch
Who am i? michael, keep the music on a cycle
So we can finish up the flow within your fro
Word out

This is called frozen style
Shatter your teeth style
Freeze like artic style y'all

Come on
Check it out
I'm the p to the o to the s
Known to pinpoint the flow to the chest
So wear your vest, nibble the thighs and breast on
Vanessa
Had to sneak it cause her moms kept me under pressure
As the sun appears to rise and set
Some cats live for the hood cause it's as good as it gets
But my plot is much thicker, I move it much quicker
Three-hundred and sixty mile to the p h
So I'm balanced, not a fella to fall
Connecting the dots, I got two propellors in awe
Went from ghetto to the meadow
Seen all degrees of hot, and froze when I was not
Like lot, my lady threw salt in the game
Invested cheese in the mouse who sent pork into fame
Now you hear my name being screamed on the ride of life
It's too late to get of, to get off

We in the house y'all, we in the house y'all
We about to get evicted, there ain't no lights or liquid
The bills ain't paid and last week we had a raid
Cause we partied too much but that's my family's trade
Invited all of my folks, and yo all my folks stayed
They tried to silence our shit, but we just pushed up the
Fade
Sat back to charge a dollar, hadn't got paid
And called on the band and got stupid when the keyboard
Played

Keeping funky with the propellerheads y'all

Now listen
You see, I'm here to usher the pain with no relief
But still get the great scotts, are you a thief? 
Seems like you got a mouth full of gold.. records
Sorry for that, platinum plaque soon to come
Till then propellor got me working the drum
For a fee so notifi the foe looking for the fumble
I hear you want to rumble on the mic, so check it out
How you want it, I got it -- oh yeah?

We gonna do it like this

Like that

I'll never give you up
No, I'll never stop
Keep it comin'
Keep on comin' 4 more 

It's that brown man from long islandin' shores
Got a way with women, so I get away with yours
Because you're whole game's outdated
Which leaves all the pretty women heavily sedated

Mummy you can play your ripley's
Or believe it or not
I shoot gift like heron
With skills of gil-scott
Nights like sir lancelot can get heated
Prescribin' your vibe, love,
I know how you need it

: 

I like to mingle sometimes
So I head out of state to find a couple of dimes
But a government rate can't settle for no nickels
Even pennies for thought for short
I need connections
With big bank selections
Securing all the sections
With sing-sing corrections
Seedin' like nature, escapin' like gas
Tell me how long this love is gonna last
Thinkin' fast might spoil somethin'
Turn a  to nothin'
 to your lady is special
Seen a bigger picture on the screen
But you're a movie, you move me
You soothe me like holidays, getaways
The brochure said do it
So true
It's not a hold hand mission
Cut the public display
Heard you're headed for the stars
Put the gazers away
Mine times out of ten
We cut to good friends
But when we on the tenth
We gotta go the length
I'm not a playa
Yet I get more play
Than a talk show shown
Cross the usa
Have em' moanin' out the vowels sounds
Ooh, eeii, and aahh
And how by now you should know me and my
Do members of the opposite sex
Have their boyfriend screaming out
We got more techs
Than that ball team in georgia

All because the ho wanna go to the casbah

: 

You can get with
Some of these women
Some of the time
When your face is in the light
 stirred with lime
Is it a crime
To set your mind to death? 
Resuscitated
See how many brain cells left
I feel your body's drawn to my positive
Don't even want a baby
If it's that easy to give
I live right around the corner
Three states away
Take a holiday
Come check me
Watch how I set the
Mood, check a movie on the tube
Get your belt mad loose like lee
Phone's turned way down
To avoid the beef
Or the questions
If she's the only one gettin' lessons
You're into crime faces, huh? 
Well I'll play your capone
Suzy q got the grill
To make the cake chrome
Situation's gettin absurd
Hot on a plat
So work the format
See how we do that? 
And you're figurin
We love on the rock
I'ma keep it up front
To maintain the stock
Displayin all the goodies
From your knuckle to knees
Make it hot like the island degrees
Now that's special

:

Please listen to this simple De La style I'm gonna sing
It's strongly directed to all the misery you're bringing
Now I'm not all about dissing someone else personnel
But there's no quota on your odor
That's right, you smell
Now you might feel a little embarassed, don't take it too hard
And don't make it worse by covering it up with some Right Guard
Before you even put on your silk shirt and fat gold rope
Please take your big ass to the bathroom
And please use

Okay contestent #2, do you have the answers?
No, no I don't

Q-tip:
Girl meets boy on thursday night
Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings bad boy joys
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on saturday
Saturday

Pos and q-tip:
Saturday, it's a saturday
It's a saturday, it's a saturday
Saturday, it's a saturday
Saturday, it's a saturday

Pos:
Back once more with the wallop in the score
Must I ride and rip, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights

Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
'cause you've worked like heck to get the week in check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody dig the funky output

Vinia:
Five days you work
One whole day to play
Come on everybody, wear your rollerskates today
It's saturday, saturday
Saturday, it's saturday
Saturday, it's saturday
Saturday, it's saturday-ay

Pos:
Now as you pump your fist I reminisce
To a bounce, rock, skate, roll
Fess to impress
Hey, pretty diamond, do you like the way I'm dressed
Cool, keep the faith and be my mate
'cause all we need is feet

But promote the hustle 'cause it keeps me thin
No need to talk, look who just walked in

Dove:

Yes, man

Oh mr. sprinkler, mr. sprinkler
Wet me for one, mr. sprinkler
I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
With a yawn I trip to the dawn
Out comes the bodies following the one idea
It's clear, rattle to the roll
Hold back up the track, grab your rollerskates y'all
And let's zip on by
Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
Sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' quick
Come on, there's no time to hide
Season is twist, spinning and winning
No hackeysack, let let me in
Spill on the bottom away, but it's okay, huh
It's a saturday

Pos:
Now let's all get baked like anita

Q-tip:
Watch mr. lawnge, don't look at the peter

Dove:
Feel on the fun, I'll feel on the

Vinia:
Hey, watch that!

De la soul:
It's a saturday

Vinia:
Now is the time
To act the fool tonight
Forget about your worries and you will be all right
It's saturday, saturday
Saturday, it's saturday
Saturday, it's saturday
Saturday, it's saturday-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Connection A, click, what?
My dick, chick
I smack a fish if you thinks
My connection ain't thick, dick
Headed like a punk whip
I travel miles with a rhythmic lip
I rock an Afro
In '83, gee, yo
And spray the sheen so I get a Soul Glow
I play the corner tough
And me and Mase pull puffs on a blunt

Givin' high-five is what I want
So I puff a blunt, I don't front
I get spliffed, get a stiff
Then I go hump a stunt
Like a pimp pro

That's cool cause I'm still an Afro bro
Yeah, I'm live for my life is hectic
Every hour, every minute, every second
I keep a level head and stay down to earth
Cause I've been an Afro since birth

Yeah
Now I hold my crotch cause I'm top-notch
I run amok Sasquatch, and I like to eat live crab
I've got five beepers, you scab
But you can find me directly on the Ave

My breath never smells wack
I eat the watermelon Tic-Tac
Before I kiss myself I always jump back

I do three flips
When a punk flip on my duke lifts
But I flex more strength when I'm asleep
On the other side with his main tapes
Make her dry her face, buy her gold earlocks
But I may, she flocks round me like a donut
She got sprinkles but I bite my way out
More brothers come about, try to scheme slick
But the Native Tongue's thick
Lick 'em real good, like a real hood should
But the fly tape let the car speakers shake
I ran a cop down, I smile a frown with a but
Show gold teeth, cause I ain't a vegetarian
Not scared of beef, sport a feather like Chief
Got a scribble pad, you can get these gonads
Cause I'm big-willed, blow off like a seal
Cause connection with the Afro is real

I be the gift of gab, but be a bro with a diss
Because it's tough to bluff a cab
No wonder Melle Mel is 'Rrrr-RAH!'
I play of tape of the son of La-di-da
My cousin Rilo sells blow, a G a day
Keeps his kids hooray, a size nine and half
I kicks my tricks, is to live for Island
I mug a mug vic, but I's cool, I self
With the quickness I bust the true slang
Show no pit to those who don't understand

The Maseo got tailed with the big bail
I busted loose but now the blue goose is on my tail
I seen the ghetto go lower than it is

My jeans are brand new, with twelve more
In the closet with my silk, and below
My 45 pack thick, draw quick
If a nigga starts some shibidibidit
My crib is uptown, downtown, L.I
And another crib in Queens
I munch some cornbread, Boar's Head
My favorite pork chops and
A plate of collar greens
I chill with Shymel, Akeem, Jaheed
And the Rastafarians'll be the crown in
And the Poppa
But the connections are still a high-five

Pos:
In america today
People think they know the way
Of the soul
De la is on the road
To blink and clear the hay
Behind the line of inner fine
We 've explained this time and time
Daisies don't mean everything
Daisies don't mean anything
But the word itself when broken up
Wears just a larger pound
D.a. stands for t-h-e
I is inner
S is sound
Y is y'all, that's you
Should see the inner sound
Will help you breathe
But still I sport a heavy sigh
When I have to explain
It's just me, myself and i
It's just me, myself and i
It's just me, myself and i
It's just me, myself and i

Paul: so, you're just yourself, huh, pos? 
Pos: basically paul, that's it.
Paul: you mean you're not a hippie? 
Pos: no.
Paul: not even a half a hippie? 
Pos: not a nugget.
Paul: wait. what about you and dove's parents? 
Pos: straight up soul brothers and sisters.
Paul: so what the full equation shows is the inner sound y'all
Should be focused on, not just the word 'daisy' itself.
Pos: most definitely.
Paul: wait a minute. did you say 'most definitely? '
Pos and paul: rrrr-rah

Ooh no-ohh, no-ohh
Ooh no-ohh, no-ohh

Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan

It ain't all good and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should it's all on you

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you-whoahhha-ohh-yeah

I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want right
The lovin' that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's invitin' so visualize the verb

You curve thoughtways when you're handlin' the candleabra
So you sittin' on the baby grand
Transmittin' like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that

I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together no pepperoni
Yeah, you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora

Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with reppin' for D

We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claimin' never been gone
Niggaz who cut us off, wanna reattach us now

Yeah, I give that ass a number and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick

So stick to the same plan, don't come shakin' my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all

Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan

You see them kids be schemin' on what we done copped
Always out there schemin'
They steady fiendin' for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiendin'?

Your people might have your back
But you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothin' guaranteed
That's the truth, things ain't goin' like you think they should

A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Aight then, here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here, keep a clear head

Tryin' to keep my pockets on stuffed like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't faze
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been there and paid my dues
I can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all, on you-whoahha-ohh

Ooh no-ohh, no-ohh

Chaka Khan, Chaka Khan

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh yeah

It's a pity that you're so dirty
Worthy of some Southern hos-pital
See we them Northern boys with nose and how's
NYC livin' ain't nothin' like it
See how me and my peeps fit, we jigsaw
Sometimes I play big saw to cut the deal
And we keepin' them bills paid with meals in the mouths of many
A noble job at Feni
Money ain't everything but everything makes me want it
But won't dishonor my name so the claim throwers
Act like game on the dice on the mic device
Stay above middle class for life
Not an easy task but I've grown to love it
Dub it to tape, why don't you whip a grin
While I speak to my mens about the world problems
And girl problems with no immediate way to solve em'
But I'm on hits

I make the best of the life I be with it
Making the most of the moment among the livin'
And it feels good
Being the man that I want to be
Do what I can cause I refuse to see
The best of luxury, God's been good to me
Now I'm asking am I worthy of you, of you
Am I worthy of you

Pull them quarters down
I got some things on these nine ounces to vamp
Me on a mission why'all
Dug fresh dirt out the ground
Lookin' for the treasures in life
A bambino picket fence around the residence
I wore these shackels here for thirteen years

But the only real slaves is the ones we record on
We off all checks and God's blessin'
Tryin' to own a thousand island like we salad dressin'
Patience for the main course
Don't have me in position to remain boss
Cause the man next to the man above the exec
Don't give a damn if I papered yet
Sometimes it make me want to go make a bet
I did away with knock em' and release some stress
By any means, these petty greens will only get me stuck in a box
Doin' a dick shot in Oz, jerkin' off in the J
But anyway I keep my head on

I know people who tippy-toe through they own stompin' ground
Master not makin' a sound to stay safe
From the local star renaissance
And the response is usually the same
Wishin' like it used to be
Nothin' in that life is new to me
We roll like eyes on a ghetto girl
Brushin' off some no-man cause she's his ghetto pearl
We into livin' beyond not livin' fads
Me and my comrads became dads young
Try to have fun amongst responsibility
Like fillin' these accounts full
Got caught up at a party in Bull's
Sometimes gotta have the nerve to say some rhymes
Because some minds take offense
Try to make ya life tense but we still here
Still gainin' the love, still standin' above most

 

Just another area 
For me to patrol 

Just another area 
That shows I got soul 

Just another area 
For me to patrol 

Just another area 
That shows I got soul 

I got soul you see  
I'm swimming in the De La 
I'm in my hood man  
My manhood worries ya 

I'm known for sampling of soul food 
Off the old school plates 
When I met up with my niggas from the 718 
One the Jungle Bro, the other Questers from Queens 
Yet I had the matrix of the 516 in my jeans 
So I sided with my funk to bring my second on call 
For me and the Sheep, our mission's on the beach of 804 
 
But still get paid in full 
 
Man, I'm packing gravitational pull 
Bring the instamatic avalanche, my code intervenes 
I'm out to scout the areas that remains to be seen 
 

Well, many many digits had me seeking in my Wizard 
Man, who's ringing up my area  oh! 
I used to shoe it to the bridge but that's gone 
Like the 718's out of Vietnam 
Sniffin' skypagers had me drugged 
 
703's on my love bug 
I made mates with the brothers up in 215 
Crazy Buddhas in my mind 
My Chattanooga champ had me late for the camp 
And my 202 keeps me marvelous 
I guess Mars was my hideaway 
But if the stars for a getaway

Since I'm capable I conjure up a walk in this way 
I slip a syllable for Aspen and a Chester souffle 
I be the 919 seeker, 'cause ain't off logic 
So when I'm with my crew I always have a place to sit 
Due to this, a brother tries to play me 
 
Yo, some kid tried to flip on me 
They instigated a brawl 
 
Then I just laughed 
 

 
And put the feelings aside, I know who I am 
I cast the grain by the pound 
I make sounds with the horn 
When I color the corn, caught the fit 
And sit the two when honey slung the tip 
Well I'm taking my finds to the 301's 
And I'm playing my flute in the rear kibbut 
My man from the 908's, he don't like it like that 
So I pipes till the sunshine hikes 
A kettle of our master plan makes a Malibu idol 
 Well, it's a hook 
The third to the 0 to the 5 had top feel the vibe 
When the 516 played convicts 

The man Maseo is here to put the habit along 
And what you have, I'm 'bout to speak about your area code 
Is it 918?  
Is it 212?  
Speakin' on 404?  
What about 516?  
What is it?  
What is it?  
What is it?  
What is it?  
 

Just another area for me to patrol 
I got status 'cause I'm baddest with the paint 
Giving upside down frowns to London wood 703 
Her moms didn't like it, I had to let be 
For the fact I lays bricks 
'Cause my semen ends with the letter T 
My seed is hard to submerge 
I play the tack in the wall if my rear's not watched 
'Cause some knuckle might just head for the urge 
But I got Prince Paul in the Area 
 
I got Hot Dog in the Area 

 

I got the Violators in the area  
I's got the Violators in the area  
It don't matter where you hide, I clear up the fall 
Cop the fuck outta here, you fake-ass fraud 
Clear my area 
 
 
 

Oh there go that bullshit again
You heard that shit?
Nah I ain't hear that
That's that bullshit from the other day
They done took the Buffalo Girls beat and changed it all around
They playin' themselves!

Jazzyfatnastees
You remind me when I reminisce of you 
All the freaky things I want to do, to you 
Rub me up, rub me down, rub me all around 
Kiss me here, kiss me there, kiss me, kiss me everywhere!
Tell me what the cost to get in line 'cause you are mine tonight
Gonna give you all I got to give, as long as you rub it right
I will love you right 
I will do you right  *come on*
Baby baby won't you be my baby baby
Be my baby baby baby baby baby baby 
Baby baby won't you be my baby baby
Be my baby baby baby baby baby baby (yo, hah, kno whatI'mean?
Gonna set it like this, what)

Now I forgot how to forget so I remember your face
With your pretty accent, wearin' man-attract scent
Others fakin' constantly stakin' out pockets of dreams
Always tryin' to sham too that's why they crave champagne
But the blame still remains not to be on you
I know your style and your love lasts Long like the Island I'm from
I'm on the drum man, and it's all good
Cause I flexed on your ex, make sure he understood
That you would, never again want to be his wife
So we connect lips to hips, and uh, eyes to thighs
You're my so-phisti-cated, lady
All mine, if you wasn't I'd go crazay

Baby baby won't you be my baby baby yeah baby, this is uh
Baby baby be my baby baby baby baby Posda on the microphone
WRMS rocks the best hey hey hey it's the fat man
Scoop Wonder ear in your hand

With Busta Rhymes, the mighty infamous
Zhane, A Tribe Called Quest, nonetheless WRMS
Fat man Scoop, tryin' to get this rap loot yeah

Phat Phat, uh
Ain't nothing wrong with big broads
Phat Phat

It's a sure bet
When I stare into your dark browns I get
Overwhelmed, overjoyed, overstep
My bounds, on your touchy subject
Your weight, your shape's not what I date
It's you, my crew don't mind it thick 
Every woman ain't a video chick 
Or runway model anorexic
I love what I can hold and grab on
So if you burn it off then keep the flab on
We gonna stay gettin our collab on 
Girl we gonna stay gettin our collab on 
We gonna stay gettin our collab on

Don't stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryin to get with ya anyway cause I know you're a nasty girl
We ain't never gon' discriminate so let me compliment your size
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

It's nothing but a little baby, phat phat
It's nothing but a little baby, phat phat
Yeah it's nothin but a litte baby, phat phat

Claim you outta shape, you not outta place 
You keep it natural with no powdered face
Without exercise you got the eye
Starin you down, make me wonder why
You women wanna frown at them stick figures
On them little ass girls, when a clique of niggas
Run up and try to hurl game for real
Your frame holds appeal in the everyday
World, and conceal is not the way
To go, I'm tellin you I had to let
Ya know, ya need to let it all hang

Don't be scared to show a little of that thang thang
No matter how you weigh it girl, it's feminine
Kinda body everybody wanna know 
Be the private dancer in my Luke show 
Skip the salad girl, bring us both a menu
Eat the whole box of chocolates I send you 
See girl, ya more than just an apple in my
Eye/I, confess I wanna get up in ya
Thighs, the rest'll tell you all the things

Don't stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryin to get with ya anyway cause I know you're a nasty girl
We ain't never gon' discriminate so let me compliment your size
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I love it when y'all broads wear it skintight 
Make the big panties look like little panties 
Tryin to lose that bottom girl you been right
I saw who make ya cookies I should go and thank ya granny 
Don't mind you being conscious of ya calories
If gettin paper was fat man you'd be salaries
You ain't in this alone I got a tummy too
Just lemme watch the weight don't let it trouble you 
Nine ten specimen up in ya jeans
You buy the size seven and just make it fit
Slim Fast, lypo, and body creams
I pray you won't endorse, I got a candle lit

Don't stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryin to get with ya anyway cause I know you're a nasty girl
We ain't never gon' discriminate so let me compliment your size
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Don't stuck on the things they say, now you know it's a nasty world
Tryin to get with ya anyway cause I know you're a nasty girl
We ain't never gon' discriminate so let me compliment your size
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

 

 

Mummy I saw one day
She was on some fume vapors
Givin' me lip so I continued with the caper
Cat litter had me sniffin
Since outside the palace
Eyes sicker than aids
Game harder than a callous
Tried to enter in her shit
She had locks on the session
Tellin me how her last man
Taught her ass a lesson damn
Well, I'm not the mayor
I take care of my dimes
But I excluded I had nickels
Addin' up to her kind
Short stacks with a wristful of jewels

Sayin she didn't need a man
To make her out for a fool
Dig it, miss, my love is credited in cupid account
And if you need that extra help
Gigglin, figurin' I had jokes for her humor
Then she broke out with the words
About knowin all the rumors
"See, all you niggas rappin be like pedigree dogs
Thinkin you can have me leashed
Around your microphone cords"
Somethin 'bout her lit me up like july
And with them onions in the pants
I couldn't help but cry
Seemed lost in the essence
But i had to find my way to take
Action for the digits just to set up a date
Thought my shinin was on
I had the skirts in the bag
Until i took a bit of time
To peep the price on the tag
She said "I'm that salt and pepa
Who like pushin it to sisters
You need to get to walkin with it mister
I think you betta listen"

 

We was at some outside jam one saturday night
When this pretty ass girl got locked in my sight
She was a ghetto philosopher
Yeah you know the type
Thinkin' Mary J. and sade understood her strife
Caught me lookin', "Yo what's cookin?"
"Nothin' from around here
So don't approach or hope
To be the man of the year"
I said listen deer or rabbit or whatever the hell you be
I'm not the one to embarrass
But the one to emcee
I traveled the world q uarters on my relationships
Used and abused by hoes
So my royalty stubs
But above all
I brought my daughter into this earth
So I understand the need
Of women feeling of worth
She glanced deep in my eyes
And said "oh shit, you're ill
I like the way your mind
Moves around at will
Still, let me apologize for soundin so sassy
But you niggas act as if my ass
Has a sign that says harass me"
Her name was gail from the union of dale
I made her remove the shades
So her eyes could tell me the plan
Yo where's your man?
"Oh that nigga's past tense
Painted bruises on my face
Haven't seen him ever since"
Gave a pinch to my bottom
And started rubbing my back
She said "i bet your ass is darker
Than a mobb deep track"
Only one way to know it
And i was down to show it
So we jetted back to my crib to set it
She made it known
"I've owned thoughts of you
Since that song 'meeny-meeny'
Can't believe you're about
To be all up in between me"
Man, the flag was lowered
So my wood was raised
Followed a shielding of my building
To protect me from the blaze
This granted access to
Southern parts of her borders
Did you have her comin'?
Like the new world order
I caught her with the right combination
A good combination
Keepin' it in her hard, man
You betta listen

 

Ha ha ha ha
Ha, ha ha ha ha
Ha! ha ha ha ha
Ah-ha ha ha, ah-ha ha ha ha, ha!!

Now this goes out to all area clicks
Centralized and way out in the sticks
Remember to keep the de la/de la/native tongue
In the mix
Just like log cabin syrup my sound is game thick
Now this goes out to all area clicks
From manicured lawns to projects bricks/bricks/from 718 to the 51-6
Remember to keep the mos def/native tongue
In the mix
Straight butter hits, drop as a good as it gets/gets/straight butter hits

Now, come on y'all, get live get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So don't none of y'all just be misled
The de la's gonna do the body good like wheat bread

Shakin laces out of shoes, mos def bought the brews
Sittin indian squats to make that red tie knots
See I'm out to get the core like in them rainbow pops
Swingin life like a hammock, invested like stocks

Via sinus complex, I aims to clog it up
Snappin by the pain as a crew hear the gain
We remain on your mind like skulls, not a golem
I'ma show it in the house all perimeters are blown

Native tongue come through to make you say yes yes
This is the body mos def style fresh like baby breath

We are the killer combination with the size to administer
The beatdown to swell up all three of your eyes

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop

I don't bug out I chill, don't be actin ill
No trick in ninety-six, native tongue gon build
But we be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
'Cause to me, mc mean, make it clean
When I speak on groups and I'm smooth like gabba d
Tryin to hang out with dove and catch love in aberdine 
I bag dimes like my man born on august 17
Life be nuttin but a river son I'm swimmin upstream

Playin wait up, with the data servin your ears
With information due to confirmation of the nation's most
Wicked ways of livin, like them glassy eyed beans
Inhale to smoke the fiends, while bangin a table
Rated at the high point of the mass
Rippin mc's at the top of a class, occasionally
Rippin some sucker's face
Or some suckable ass from a girl
It's a big brother beat for the wide wide world

I'm makin memos off these demos back in eighty-nine
Took you all on encounters of an unknown kind 
Did the hustle with a couple of us, but soon noted
That my niggaz buttered benedict rolls, and then voted
I wrote in the dark so I could feel it like braille 
Heard the big brother beat, got locked with no bail
Came to set like equators invented, with the heat
Yo mos def how you radiate to make it complete

Right, so when I shine the light crabs wince
Manifestin for the future here in the present tense
No doubt, I love the sound biggin out off your jeeps
Son I want the little kids bangin big brother beats

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop 

Now check it out, and ya don't stop
We got the big brother beat, ya don't stop 

We straight butter hits, we straight butter hits
Perfecta, perfecta
Perfecta, perfecta
Perfecta, perfecta
Word up

-- Welcome to the second installment..
Why'all know my name so we ain't gotta get into alla that
Why'all know the deal
This is AOI part two, and we call this one 'Bionix' 
And as why'all always know, we gon' hit why'all with that De La shit
Yeah.. yeah..

Uh  yea 
Yea 
Yea..

Ladies and gentlemen, we in the trench again
Makin it relevant, just for the hell of it
I'm introducin it, throw a little juice in it
Got on that old bullshit to get you used to it
It's been a minute now, only a minute now
A little re-evaluatin, hope you feel me now
I'm on some new me, focused on the new tree
Tryin to shake the money off the limbs so I can do me
I blame the fans for it, I heard demands for it
Went to Somalia, they holdin out they hands for it
Went to the hood, these niggaz tried to trace a dance for it
Dancefloor it after Mase brings you out of the break

-- Before we go any further we want to send a special thanks
To all those folks out there that been supportin De La since '89
Now that's a long time
Overseas, city to city, state to state

Yeah, we gon' keep bringin it live to you..

Unlike these underground MC's who rock for heads
We include the throat chest arms and legs
No need to spit in the cypher to show you I'm a lifer for rap
I cultivate moves larger than that
And I don't ball too much, ya dig
I gotta ball and chain at my crib who want my ass home
My heart-BEAT N.Y.C. metronome
But can't adapt to where I'm at
And even though I sing it sick 'til I'm blue, I'm not a crip
So unlike non-GANG members I won't see-walk to look hip
But if I had to join a gang I think I'd join GangStarr
Me, Guru and Primo with them beats for the car
That bounce trampoline style, revamp the deen child
Hot and mild and I hustle rap the same
Cuff a little shit, due to muscle fat, I gain
We them God type dishin the grunge to make you love

-- Yeah kids
Just a little taste how we gon' get things started in a minute
Sit back, get your headphones straight
Whether you're ridin in a Escalade or a Pinto son, turn that shit up
Oh remember AOI part three comin soon, on some DJ shit
Yeah - we about to get this shit poppin..

well it was a Wednesday
Me and boss hog was kinda hungry
Like two eggs, and a slop beef slice of lettuce
And a glass of milk and some cookies
Spotted in the mist was a bk logo
What we said well what do you know
This chick thought I was trying to play fly
'Cause I had a pair of blue jeans on

Young girl, won't you take my order? 
She said, "yeah, but right now I'm sorta busy
Can't you see I'm trying to put this band aid on my finger? "
Lingering, I could tell
She's a b-k mademoiselle
Ripped uniform and bottom bell
And some jelly stuff on her sleeve
Look to this cause I had no name tag on my collar
Could be pissed cause she's clocking 2. 45 an hour
And then boss hog hollar
Girl you better make this quick! 
She said, "I ain't your girl and I ain't your chick! "
I had an idea and lickity split
Took my hat off and that was it

Dread locks fallen all over me and then I said
Yeah now we'll see! 
And o' with quick velocity honey was mesmerized
"ain't you that guy? "
Ain't you that girl! 
"de la soul, right? "
No tracy chapman! 
"why don't you come over to the counter and write me out an autograph? "
Ha ha ha, I had to laugh
She was quick with the bic just to get that autograph
But me and hogg just laughed, and laughed
"what's the name of that song you sing? "
Living in a fast car, I said
Forget about the order I made
I'll go get a slice of pizza instead

bitties in the Bk lounge, all they do is beg and they scrounge

Excuse me, would you take my order I have to go
Shashawna's got a real job, dag don't you know! 
Oh yeah, it's you now I recognize
The real real bitty with the fake fake eyes
Yo, can I interest you in some burgers and fries? 
Yes you can, but you can keep your lies
Cause you know you can't diss me
But your pissing me off
I know where you live and I know that you're soft
You're as booty as they come 
And you dress like a geek
My shoes cost more than you make in two weeks
Look, you don't have to play fly in here
I can tell your fly by the weave that you wear! 
but you must be aware that a fly can be swatted by a Bk tray
By the way yo, here's yours
I know your just sweating me to kill the noise
Of your polyester pants and thier o' so high waters
Look at what you do all day but take orders
You bow tie wearing, clocking and staring
I know your just upset because you can't get the rap
I think you chubby for my man is living slack
Yeah, I know your man, the biggest punk in school
Selling devil rock to the fiends and the fools! 
With one hand that punk I could snap the kid is so skinny
But we be livin fat
Speaking of fat, would you like a diet soda? 
'Cause less fat on you would spare us all the odor
Better yet pour it down the pants and let the acid kill
The smell that should have been left to masingel! 
Let me make you a deal, take the soda free and jet
I got to much family to heed your threats
Are you a family man? 
Well I shouldn't be surprized
Your sister's flipping burgers and your momma's frying fries
Don't even try that shit! 
Oh damn look! 
Here comes one more
It's your father he just finished mooping the floor
Now give them a hand, its the bk clan
So you can't talk garbage about who I am
Well, arn't we living foul
Speaking of foul how bout some chicken for the cow? 
Oops I meant you sorry for the mix up
But your stomachs always big from the sexual slip ups! 
I could buy you and sell you for pennies, young man! 
I think theres something you should understand
I try to be nice and help the poor make money
And since I know you need it, I'll go elsewhere dummy! 
Now b-k workers is too damn rude
I think I'll go get me some chinese food

Eh ha-ha, eh ha-ha, eh ha-ha-hah
Maseo, what goes on? Maseo, what goes on? 
I don't know
Maseo, what goes on? Maseo, what goes on? 
I don't know
Maseo, what goes on? Maseo, what goes on? 
I don't know
Maseo, what goes on? 
I don't know, but check me on out
Bitties, y'all be flippin
Ah-ah, ya buggin
Bitties y'all be flippin
Ah-ah, ya buggin
Ask for a burger, catch an attitude
The taste is worse, come off extremely rude
But when I snap back, you tamper with my food! 
Ah-ah, ya buggin
Bitties y'all be flippin
Ah-ah, ya buggin
Bitties y'all be flippin
Honey, your hair really looks a bore
A fool of a hat, not mine's for sure
Forget the burger, let's walk up over a donut store
Eh ha-ha-ha-hah

Yo yo, hey man, ain't you guys among, Plug One? Plug Two?
Potholes in my Lawn? You're those weird guys, De La Soul, right?
Yeah, what's up little man, how you feeling? I'm Dove, how you feeling?
Yo what's up man? My name is Pos, yo yo I'm Mase
Yo shorty, what's your name?

Oh, my name? Jeff, you guys are walking?
Now rappers ain't supposed to walk, sorry little man, but you know
Jeff, I told you, my name is Jeff, if you guys are rappers
Where's your dukey gold chains? y'all don't have no dukey gold chains
We don't wear gold chains, we'd rather spend our money on more Important things like, equipment, necessities and video games

Y'all are crazy, no chains, dag, okay, where's your BMW?
You're not supposed to walk, where's your jeeps, your Maximas?
Maximas? Yo, Maxin' would break my flow and with the cause of gas
Jeff man, I'd rather take the transit that's mass

What you say? You are see are A Z E E, crazee
Don't you know you can't be def if you don't have no gold?
Or a car, man? What's up? Who told you that?
Everybody who's def has gold, cars, money, girls, clothes

Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute shorty, you're buggin'
Do you like Plug Tunin' and Potholes? Yeah that song's def
But we don't wear no gold chains, nor do we ride BMW's
And Maxes or Jeeps, but you still think our music is def, right?
Wait a minute, did I say 'def'? Rrah! What?

Nothing, nothing, it's just that we don't deal with all that
Materialistic stuff, but we still got what it takes to please
And supply our listeners, understand my man?
Where's your beepers? Why don't you have beepers?
Everybody wears beepers, you have to have beepers to look down

Augh, little man is brainwashed indeed
Nah, nah, beepers are the least of status situators, man
Plus I find them ugly as parking tickets, you guys talk funny
Well ,actually our verbal is kinetic, so when released flow A to Z
Is perfectly pitched in andvance in intricacy

Yeah, you homeboys are really bugged
Wait a minute, did he say, bugged? Rrah!
So no car, no beepers, no gold, that's weak man, that's weak
Jesus, did he say weak? Jesus, they never learn
Foolish mind, have I, have I actin' like that lady, that lady
Peace, my brother

There's a lot of people out here 
Who just don't know 
What plays a factor 
In movin' heads and toes 

It be them hits 
Hangin' out of them stereo kits 
Whether cassette radio or cd bits 
Mix tapes from the best 

Going on and on 
Throughout the city grounds 
To suburban lawns 
Man  we don't play 

Even where we stay 
Videos shows the visuals 
Of jams today 
Coinciding with the rhythm 

Of the heart and neck 
The brakes got you 
In your proper context 
You let your lex or your 

Sixty-four suspension 
Bounce away all your tension 
En route to the club 
Where girls need the quenchin' 

Diamonds on your wrist 
Sunroof top 
But niggas out front 
Makin' guns go pop 

So the spot gets shut 
But on to the next 
'Cause your ears get vexed 
When they don't get the fix cause 

 
It be your listenin pleasure 
While you're doin your chores 
 

No matter where you from 
It's for you and yours 
 
Bringing it back to the brakes 

Like the 'yes yes y'all' 
 
So let it be your anthem 
When you're havin' a ball 

Well it's silly of me 
To think that I 
Would never get a chance to see 
A piece of this pie 

I sat dead in front of speakers 
Thinkin' that could be me 
Anticipatin' open microphones 
So I could emcee 

Had a catalogue of raps 
Impressin' all the 'round-the-wayers 
Before I went to bed 
Included rhymes into my prayers 
But that rhyme is all on paper 

I want my song on vinyl plates 
I dreamin' hits and doin' shows 
Makin my niggas spines shake 
Expectin' nuttin but a little bit 

Of radio play 
Gettin diced on 1 and 2's 
By the best djs, hey 
Time was kinda tight 

But still i dotted on the line 
And some expected me 
To start buhlooning in the mind 
Seein' spaces and places 
That i couldn't pronounce 
But still i had the pulleys 
To make all the bullies bounce 
With the blessings of the great 

We took it from state to state 
'Cause we landed on the good foot 
And got our biggest brake cause 
 

A mother gets mugged 
By her crackhead son 
"That's the brakes, that's the brakes" 
You're in the wrong part of town 

So the shots make you run 
"That's the brakes, that's the brakes" 
Your best comrades put six tabs 
In your o.e. 

"That's the brakes, that's the brakes" 
Your boyfriend made you a carrier of HIV 
"That's the brakes, that's the brakes" 
Now what's gonna happen 

When the sun don't shine 
I'm buyin tickets aboard 
The caravan of love 
Hey fellas 

See, money don't make shots repel 
I break woes and compose 
Some rhymes to tell 
So when the party's live 

It shouldn't be beef 
Or playin' indian roles 
I guess you thought you was chief 
Seems all broke up 

And now you woke up surprised 
Situation's gettin sticky 
Dead in front of your eyes 
We play the wall 

Similar to tacks 
Until the dj plays 
The necessary track 
In fact as the jam plays on 

Out comes all your bread 
To pay for drinks 
For them girls you want to spread 
Don't be mislead 

When the brakes inside your head 
And have you reminiscing 
On them kids who got you fed 
Until reality reveals a miss 

Who wants to know 
If you can play her real close 
Out on the dance floor 'cause 
 

It be your listenin pleasure 
While you're doin your chores 
 
No matter where you from 

It's for you and yours 
  
Ringin it back to the brakes 
Like the 'yes yes y'all' 

  
So let it be your anthem 
When you're havin, a ball

Ah one two, ah one two

Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two

I was born in the Boogie Down catscan
Where my building fell down on the rats and
People sorta super wanna trip to the penile 
While I settle off the shores of the Long Isle
My father's clean not mean my mind is clear when I transmit
I am the man-ner of the family cuz the pants fit
I want to let forensics prove, that I can mends
Groove wit the thread from needle outta hay, wanna say
Salutations to the nation of the Nubians
We bout to place you in that 3 Feet of stew again
I got the frequency to shatter Mrs. Jones' perm
I gotta +Hey Love+ all the honies cause they're short term
Tallyin the score I'm for the shottie in the jacket
For the brother he's a nigga when he packs it
So get your butt out the sling, I stung Muhammad float a note
That means I'm def, so like the autographs you sign until the

"Breakadawn, breakadawn"
Ah one two, ah one two

Ayo groove with the mayor, hazard on the sayer
Wave the eighteen mill', eat a still
Sack or bag of troubles, make the single double
Loop the coin and join the minimum wage
I had a plan if I was the man, I'd throw the J
Lay it low and late night I get sessed
Uncondition my ways, of the everyday sunset
Wagin my days, to the one bet
Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
Cause the days of the breaks, be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm EXPLODING

I be the fab I be the fabulous but see unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name "ah one two, ah one two"
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
Latchin on to when I caught the fame "ah one two, ah one two"
Pass the task to ask me bout the Native Tongue again my friend
I tell you Jungle Brothers +On the Run+ "ah one two, ah one two"
I'm shakin hands with many devils in the industry
Believe the Genesis like Phil with stills mean that I'm def
So like the autographs you sign until the

"Breakadawn, breakadawn"
Ah one two, ah one two

We in the mornin at the end, but in the end I be the is
Cause in the mix, man, it's alright
Momma got the rhythm to my daylife
My pops gots enough so best to leave or sail the waves
To the Long I laid the anchor in the 'Ville
And how I relate, the same side of my gates
Paper days, mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eyescan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew up with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz/fuzz
A simple, "How ya do?" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special

Now there's no Shiny Happy People in the crew we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low
You know the neverending factor while I'm over, tell a squid
I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
 Yo he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin up the stream
Plug Wonder Wonder Why you're lonely tonight
We see the girls scream as if we're shocked by the live shell
Let's round em up and get em back to the hotel
Motel, holiday, inn-fact!
I'm gonna let you know, once again, that De La Soul
Is sure to show you we will hit the charter harder
Than the normal rappin fool "ah one two, ah one two"

Ah one two, ah one two

Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two

Hello

Meany, meany, meany, meany 
Meany, meany, meany, meany 
Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean
Meany, meany, meany, meany 
Meany, meany, meany, meany 
Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean 

Hello it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best 
The best 
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch

Nets won't be needed unless

I won't lie, I love b-u-d-d-y 
Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny
I seem  like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me
Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the

Q to her tip

On the A side and sometimes the flip

Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3

Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out

My buddy helps me to

Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins 
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy I will toast
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mines and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' less Tru know 
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare  word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you 

And I watched and then I checked my swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was 

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands

Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas should we keep her aware

As soon as a La stepped off 
People started hollerin' 
Beggin' us to bless 'em with an 
You know the Peas they game to that 
No matter what the coast we, be on
Pacific or Atlantic we, stay strong
Foreign or domestically, we conquer
All obstacles professionally and rock on
And that's exactly how we made it rock 
We turn this on and then we make it hot 
We also known to cause a state of shock 
We start at 2 then go to 10 o'clock 
10 o'clock the next day that is 
No matter what city or state that is 
Don't ask no questions, that's the way that is 
Don't ask no questions, that's the way that is

Back, back, back, back, and forth
From Ca-li to New York

Introduce Posdonus y'all 
Sticky like cous-cous y'all 
Be the words that I ap-ply 
My peeps mass, karma N.Y. 
Check it out, you see you other emcees, sound like brother emcees
Raised by the same pop and mother emcees
While I got a lot of brand in my name, I'm recognizable
Leavin' me the cash amount, that's quite sizable
Rich in that English that's broke as hell
That's why my niggas in the hood understand me so well
Its the modern rap type talk
Used to walk, all over your ears
You hear the thump, this track pumps like, well order
Some others fell short of the line of finish
You didn't practice harder at the scrimmage
Now my image is the golden cup
My career is dirty compared to yours, it's all washed up

We, we, we, we regulate and cross plates, destruct ya
Toss coins to distract it and we bust ya
Minds blow bigger than tempers out in Russia
Cuss like a sailor, make you shame like Thelya
Stitch a verse tailored to fit
Spray paintin' your spit
On the deco we art, spread apart
I raid mo' tracks than flicks in "Beat Street"
With kicks until the sole/soul wear out, never that!
We weather that, you light in the ass and feather that
Heavy like black leather coats, you pleather that
Last dick on the line, we way ahead of that
Squeezin' like Freddie Foxx, and his two glocks
Rocks don't impress niggas who speak to God
We get jams to make a tuna melt
Held down by the B.E.P, we strictly, new getty
Two-fifty up in front of the mic, so what it look like?

Ahh yeah, ah ah ah
Prince paul likes buddy
Posdnuos likes buddy
Trugoy likes buddy
Mase likes buddy
Wouldn't you like to buddy too? Ooh

Prince paul needs a haircut
Mase needs a haircut
Posdnuos needs a haircut
Trugoy would you please give us a haircut?

Prince paul needs a luuden
Trugoy needs a luuden
Posdnuos needs a luuden
Mase needs a luuden
Everybody i want to just get a luuden

Paul has dandruff
Posdnuos has a lot of dandruff
Mase has big fat dandruff
Trugoy has dandruff
Everybody in the world, you have dandruff

Dante is a scrubb
Dante is a scrubb 
Dante is a scrubb 
Dante is a scrubb  

Once again it's time to buy more soul
A flavor you will savor in your soul
Wax is distributed and then sold
So watch it turn, bring your next of kin soul
P.A. Mase has rocked it on the console
Scream real hard until you blow your tonsils
Bang-oh-bang until you burn your shoe soles
Cause you are now dancing to the new soul

Live is the motion of the soul step
Set the exposure to my one step
This scene'll last to the next step
All those in favor take a big step
True to the Soul, we'll never back step
In sense to that, we don't half step
Just as a reminder from the last step
Negative ones are lost in footsteps

Levels we've set will never go down
Competitions commence the step down
Those involved with peace who know the Soul's down
Can see that the Soul has got a new sound
Dance until you find yourself a new part
If you don't then I'll give you the True part
When received you'll see the real small part
Of the new way is no part at all

Pos and Dove is rarely caught not dressed in peace
Movements always walking round now stressing peace
When this biter should know true in peace
Instead they cause violence and shoot out beef
Still we are professing to be on a roll
Public cause this party going on the road
And if you crave sex, drugs and rock'n'roll
Sent by the Quest, Jungle and De La Soul

Give 'em a taste, Mase

Peace, this is Spike Lee
A.k.a. Shelton Jackson Lee
A.k.a. loving husband and father
Of Tonya and Satchel and Jackson
I'm here with De La Soul
A.k.a. De La, a.k.a. The Plugs
We're about to get in this song, "Church"
A.k.a. "It's Reality"!

Hey yo, wake up! 
Wipe the sleep from ya eye cracks
It's time to focus y'all, fix ya I-MAX
In other words, listen to the brother's words
Ingest these anecdotes with hope!
And ya ass, may learn how to cope!
It's not always good just to get by
Who's coverin' ya stakes when ya bet high?
You're cha-sin', cars, clothes and rocks
Identify with the goods you got
Make sure it's V-S-One, not
And perfect, leavin' you one clear
I really don't care to see ya tattoos there
I'd rather see you graduate the school year
Black folk, go put a book in ya face
But first give the hook a taste
Bring the preacher in!

Heal! Heal, y'all!
We comin' healin'! {It's real!}
It's real! {It's real!} It's real!
It's realer than real, realer than real

It's a sick world that we live in, let some tell it
Some put it in books, some yell it
You need to make your own choice, be your own voice
Set ya soap-box up, let your talk fight
Pull ya socks up, get ya walk right
Or the chalk might outline ya one day
You oughta try steppin' outside you one day
You circle round yourself like you the answer
To the question of your inner son
But keep ya falsehoods to a minimum 

We all need a little church
A life update, keyword, update
If they don't serve change, don't bite the bait
Instead of givin' you a share, servin' you a dish
I lead you to the water, show you how to fish
Ain't nothin' wrong makin' that bread wid'it
But don't let the bread get to ya head, geddit?
Admit it, when you can't stand alone
I want to stand up, give all the pretend up
And get a full blast of my demands of
The rhyme runner said the man's come
There's something in our words that reveal 
Sure 'nough real!

Heal y'all! We come to heal!
So let it heal you! It's real!
 It's real!
It's realer than real, realer than real

Heal y'all! We gonna heal it!
So let it heal!  It's real!
 So real!
It's realer than real, for real, for real

The early bird gets the worm in this rotten apple
But explore deep and you will the find the seed
Plant more ether, get your mind free
We roll passionate, put your lights last in it
You're holding fear too close, unfasten it!
And like old age invades youth
Invade falseness with truth
Replace rebelling with rebirth
Face new dwelling, that's your turf
Lean back and put your feet up on the sofa
Relax!  learn how to punch back
And do your work to the max
The payoff's much sweeter than the payback
Even the hay sack needle wouldn't play that
So let's pray at, church 

Heal! Heal, y'all!
We comin' healin'! {It's real!}
It's real! {It's real!} It's real!
It's realer than real, realer than real

Heal y'all! We comin' healin'!
So let it heal! {It's real!}
It's real! {It's real!} It's real!
It's realer than real, realer than real

Reality!
Reality real! Real!

You know what I mean? Rap outsold crack
You know, so rap, or hip-hop culture
However you want to dice it, you know what I'm sayin'
It's the most powerful drug there is, man
It changed corporate America, it changed the way you feel about me
It change the way I, I do my thing now
Busta was the one who came out, on the award show and said that
Hip-hop provides jobs for people who don't even love the shit
I mean, come one man, I mean what else is there to say?

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

Yeah, ha-ha
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now time for me is nothing 'cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless
To those the definition for what life is
Priceless
To you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it?
Gun smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among those
Possess you with one go

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future  is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on

The essence, the basics
Without, did you make it?
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise 
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ' and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless 
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
My future

Look man!  You're botherin' me G
I got shit to do right now, aight?
This is for De La Soul, why'knahmsayin?
Word up I got shit to do you test tube baby! 

Check one two, check one two
De La Soul, is now back on the map
Long Island, is now back on the map
Good rap music, is now back on the map
Yo check one two, this is the voice of yours truly the Flava Flav
And I just want y'all to know, we ain't goin nowhere
Old school is here to stay boy!

On the outskirts, of what works
Live those who go for broke, and merk to get merked
Live by the sword and die by the semi
Not part of my ways, but stays right in my
N.Y. mentality for me to be the best
The current, the ones who weren't
pressed, to confess lies over hot joints
to sell to all who want to hear some

They don't give a SHIT who's hot
Just long as you're not, pussy, and be the would-be King
But once crowned, the same want to pull you down

And I be the world renowned Wonder Why
Wonderin why you can't stand me
Is it because I'm the main Jackson
and y'all just Titos and Randys? 
Bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last
At the same time, I want respect and cash
And a few paragraphs in them books
Tellin you how us Native Tongues made hits with no hooks
Rapped in every prefixes, gave birth to rap remixes back in '88
No disrespect to Diddy just settin it straight
Instead of zig-zaggin', got a degree in braggin
My daughter says I'm a teen, cause like a teen
my pants always saggin and I walk with a bop
The {?} part of my time, I walked from my pop
No longer on timey and was never on Loud
But cooked rhymes that make the Chefs of Wu proud
I'm top cloud to rain on your show
And still "anything goes when it comes to hoes" because

Music  New York  Detroit  c'mon down!
Miami  L.A.  Vegas  c'mon down!
Boston  Tucson  Long Island  c'mon down!
V.A.  Portland  Chi-Town  c'mon down!

Make you shake like, sunshine, naked shoe was once mine
Had bottom inner drawers and used to hit it from the mids
Fix your playground player or some kids'll
come stomp in your sandbox, swollen hands cocked back
No knives, no drama, no guns
No disrespectin' your seed or Ma Dukes
I puke rhyme and you laugh, take a sniff
of these fricaseed raps on Caribbean riffs
See last night's change was today's dough money
No time for your freestyles so roll money
No more whack albums with two joints
No more ballplayin' rappers who shoot ya two points

Your flows bore like seashores with no bitches
Switchhittin' niggaz will receive no pitches
No diamonds on the field, just keep the game real
simple, see the God flows healthy
Wealth in the mind is like money in the bank
Exchange cash like thoughts in conversation
Thank you for your purchases, we dough out
and roll out the cool-Aid, {?} see us pimp strut
Ain't really pimpin', I'm tryin' to catch the bus
The Krush Groove ain't got shit on Cold Crush!
We dolly dolly babies cause we shootin' cats
'Back to the Future' rap with Doc Brown shotgunnin' it
And pantyhose your whole style and start runnin' it
You dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello
The mush-in-your-room son, we stay portobello
Can't settle for the same picket white fence
I got dreams of barbed wire in front of factories pa
Still push the truck with the factories pa
I'm bound to wreck the whip and turn insurance out, make 'em shout

D.C.  Oakland  U.K.  c'mon down!
New Orleans  Little Rock  be	-More  c'mon down!
Memphis  Utah  Jersey  c'mon down!
Atlanta  Brooklyn  Philly  c'mon down!

Yeah that's right!  Flava Flav, with De La Soul
Act bold, and we knock you straight up in the hole
why'knahmsayin?  Six feet deep, that's the way that we keep, rollin
why'knahmsayin?  Operation tech sensation in the nation
Ready to take it to Penn Station, why'knahmsayin?
Yeah, ah ha ha ha
Long Iz one is, that's where we is man 
De La Soul, you done it again!
De La Soul, you done it again! 
De La Soul, you done it again! 
Flava Flava, De La Soul, you done it again!

(once again my friend the funky beat has hold and we going on down to
The a.m. for you and your friend, sounds here tough on the ear, you
Know that, coming at you so loud and clear so you have no fear we got
The voice of the people's choice, the man with the plan who's got the
The groove that makes you move, take your body higher, set your soul
On fire, playing so dance to the beat and move your feet, top
Performers cold hardcore music deejays....)

Pos:
Johnny fever, I won't catch
I'm mr. shockin' body rockin' finger pop I never stop
That means I run it to the break
'cause I'm a sugar blizzard
I'll blow you like a chicken and stab you in your gizzard
Nah nah, let me back that up
I think I'll freakin' shoot ya
Parlay and smoke a l with my honey for the future
Man, I'm happy as can be 'cause I got my oe
Nah nah, let me back that up, let me back that up
Johnny fever, I won't catch
I'm mr. shockin' body rockin' finger pop I never stop
That means I run it to the break
'cause I'm a sugar blizzard
So when I come girls run the tongue like a lizard
Yo, my style was created from the tapes of boys and girls
Who had the second generation dubs of crews at harlem world
Like the fearless, the crush, the furious
Where I transform to the physical in the latin quarters
I was curious to how kris and scott blew the stage
Back then I didn't know you kept the ego front page
I didn't know you had to keep the ego front page
I didn't know you had to keep the ego front page
I didn't know you had to keep the ego front page
Like my man from black moon when he enters the stage
I didn't know you had to keep the ego front page
I didn't know you had to keep the ego front page

Dove:
I got seventeen kids who speak to peak rhythms
And they all know I didn't come to make any sense
I heard mikey roads bust licks like
Hey ma, what's for dinner? , spit cuss like a winner
Malibu down 'cause they can't see the standard I clown
Bundles and bags is sniffin' like
Dragons  and dragons  and dragons 
Hit the pit stop on the corner 'cause I see brothers flaggin'
Party on the moon but first I gots to spoon
It's wiggle your ass man, you made the jam jiggle like
Whoomp, not that, ain't it? I hit the elephant
Damn, super lover man, your shit look thick
But first things first I'm gonna take it to the sea
The chattanooga champ is gonna take it to the sea
I'm the employer, you're my employee
You gots to bust your ass for the cash money
Double on a bobo, mr bartender
Got to make this tree look pretty tonight
I'm on a kite, never trippin' on the ego
You know how we go, if I had a million bucks
I'd go buy me an amigo, a house and a pinball machine
Slip myself some spanish fly and wet dream
Amazing how I zoom to the pervert mode
You wanna know why, you ask me why
 
You wanna know why, you ask me why
 
You wanna know why, you ask me why
 
Do you wanna know why, you ask me why

Pos:
Well you wanna know why, I'll tell you why
Classic example of a date rape
Check the moves in the laces so the shoes won't fake
Standing on the bread, honey take the moves to the head

Dove:
Nah nah nah, just sit to this permanent
'cause I'm a never movin', I clown it like
Get down, get down on the illegitimate
Yes I am the chattanooga
I know this girl named joelle, her mama drives a cougar

Pos:
Ay yo, I flaunt gets way beyond the bets
Little girl be cheesin' when I'm twirling her barrettes
I'm entering through the centre in 'cause she sweats
Now her mister needs to see if my construction can be kept
I run it back to when I had millie in the sack
Where she did the nothing 'cause her father showed her something
I ain't frontin', I'm mashing all the comp 'cause I'm thorough
Like crack, that's here to clear the inner city boroughs
But jump inside your mind so there's no escapism
Yo, de la soul is here to stay like racism
You wack-ass rappers, they don't take much to see
If you don't sync with my mental
What the fuck makes you think you can touch me? 
Well anyway, I'm levelling the masses, which gets me asses
Now tell me who be the tramp
Hey yo honey, what the fuck you riffin' about? 
Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out
Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out
Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out
Hey yo honey, what the fuck you riffin' about? 
Love should have brought me home but sex kept me out

Cool breeze 
Rock that shit homie 
Rock 
Light as a 
Rock 

A a a a a as a rock 
Cool breeze 
Rockin' it  rockin' it

Rock's the best 
Rockin' music 
Cool breeze 
The king 

Of rock'n'roll 
Rock  rock 
This world for you 
King Adrock 
Rock those bells

Body body rock  body body rock 
You are now rockin' with the best 
I put this together to 
Rock the house 

Michael? 
"I want to" 
Rock! 
"With you"

Ladies and gentlemen!
We got De La up in the house tonight
They just walked up in here
We gon' see if they can come up here
and do a lil' somethin for us

Yo, it's star-studded in here
I'm on the moon like the first man
First can I grab is gon' get it
She all independent but want her throat wetted
Tight from the floor to height
See I saw the night, in dream bubbles I fiend to see double
so I sip until my bladder bust
You in V.I.P., so why you mad at us? 
By-stand, I'm in the world fox-trottin
gettin my Fred Astaire on, follow my lead girl

Me and you come over, we
do it like the cha-cha, just
like we at the Cop-a, Ca-bang-a 

For all my niggaz runnin around like the mothership landed
Or is it because there's some others who handed
their daughters over to the night life
Yes we tryin to find a night wife to get wit
Interface with they whole clique, I force the draft
I get the first pick, run this easily
?? rule like D, Joey and Jay
Around the way, we're goin
but first tell all these women who ain't knowin

Yo I talk no shame upon this
I got aim all on this to shoot and score the trout
who's actin all cute and out of position while I'm wishin
to get her bottom limbs arched like a grasshopper

Puttin in work to make it last proper
Ninety percent of the time is on my mindframe
So I'm game to reign up to par
while my fam runs it cool up at the bar, I stay clearheaded
Lettuce enough cheese to get shredded
We like Navy Seals lookin for the gold
Our natural appeal got them others on hold
Them girls dealin with us tonight
Came with the large appetite and got served
Got nerve to think less, you can bless me and my kinfolk
Rushin up against my yolk-sac promote that
pimp play upon how we get it on for real!

You see you hopeless up in the spot
Talkin a lot of champagne taste holdin 40 ounce pockets
Switch the sprocket to gear to top of the year
We gon' drop it like confetti on it, get ready on it
Her fast ass want to get all Andretti on it
Makin my main man Poke like Trakmasterz
Blazin-trail, we Portland to Nor-ton
'Honeymoon' flicks don't exist in this
I sip a little left to twist spines together
Vertical hold, we gon' combine together 
Even if we spill the love
we got compliments up at the front door
Just tell em Dullah sent ya
Thirty minute Tae*Bo shit's how I bench ya
All on a Saturday night, step to life
I love the way Sally walk
Bow legged in a two piece steel, we live in New York
We live in New York

(I love daisies, I love daisies
I love pushing up your favourite daisies)

DAVE HAS A PROBLEM SERIOUSLY

Yo Merc, it's Dave, you there?
Hello. Hello, Merc. Hello. Hello, Merc
Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me!
Huh! Hah! Huh! Huh! Huh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Feel the funk, baby!

Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh

 
]Yo how the days of your life go Com? 
That's it? 
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now 
Too soon?

I want the boom in the back of the truck
Ain't nuttin' the matter with a good dude havin' a buck
With that on my mind, I'm on the grind, it pays
We break it down in these three ways, yo

These days, I travel the Maze like Frank Beverly
To the East, lookin' for pieces of a better me
Responsibility of my man's felony fell on me
Celebrity status, make 'em think I got celery

Hell and I do sometimes, still the sunshine ain't even all day
 The life of a baller, ain't even all play
I stack 'em, so the chips fall where they must
I ain't far from a Benz, or dude on the bus

Even when I don't have enough, still in God I trust
Said baby you're a star
Said I'm on the car, seen the jiggiest of stars
Become dust, and one love become lust for the papers
Had you gassed now that - gas became vapors
Tricked your cash on ice; shoulda had acres
Now your, empire fell like the Lakers
So you're talkin' to your maker

It's the nature of the business, they givin' niggaz inches
Takin' miles and mules, it's the wildest rules
I'm tryin' to walk in the black scent of proudest shoes
Makin music that the crowds can use

Yo how the days of your life go Dave? 
That's it? 
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now 
Too soon?

I want twenty-four plus on these
Put the Pinto engine and the bus on these
I get that first class seat to escape the days
We break it down in these three ways

Check the life I got that antidote, cantelope scent, bent back
In the sunroom froze, put your flick on pause 
There's no occasion nigga it's just because
I'm celebratin' for a hell of a day

Get these barbie filets on hot charcoal tracks, so black
Darko Pecoltrane plays them back
We them freedom fight kids who gon' ball and raise fists
If y'all down for the struggle, c'mon y'all, resist

Everyday script, I exercise cheek
Sixteen on the bar, I exercise speak 
It's been a long time, Long Isle's on the map
While y'all stand on the corner, stoned like Chris Back
Kiss back, watchin' time - wrist back
Every second count but just finish this lap
You gamble on your life like casino slots
And cash out and still walk with a knot

 
Yo how the days of your life goes Merce? 
That's it? 
Watch the problems of the world go by like balloons
If tomorrow come now 
Too soon?

I furnished the rooms, and mortgage on these
See them quittin' ass rappers caused a shortage on these
The soul boys of big illa-noyz get the praise
We break it down in these three ways

My moms died from secondhand smoke; so I wish yo' ass would die
From them secondhand rhymes you wrote
Or shall I call them second rhymes - written seconds 'fore you enter the booth
Words thrown together with very little truth
And a select few can do it  you ain't part of them scriptures
And got the nerve to feel you want me out the picture
But I was never in it, I'm the frame around the flick
Or dishin' in the mouth of your dame around my dick

Ladies and gentlemen, introducin' Workmatic
One of L.I.'s finest, and this is 
Which is filled with bad minutes and good hours
And, good months and bad years and with my peers
We struggle to juggle the shit
Family life and the music game don't easily fit

My lady wants me home, sayin' rap tour three rap whores
And scores of scandal, even more than we can handle
Sometimes, the rhymes I say
Is the fly the currency to save the day
Can't turn it away, cause we out
To find presence way beyond our measure, so baby don't pout

Don't pout, De La Soul now turn it out
Don't pout, Common Sense'll turn it out
Don't pout..

This is De La Orgee

Yo, this girl called me...
Hi pos! heard your shit, back in style baby!
Heard the De La, said I'm back in style y'know? 
Heh...

You-you-you... you need to stop

I declare that only live niggaz rap this year 
Jam's off the meter yo, this {shit} is hot 
There's always one... 
Amateurs get hung with they own gold chains 
There it is!!
I declare that only live niggaz rap this year 

The average Mc sells terror
We nail terror up against the wall for target practice
Not one of your top five Mc?s
But I see clearly with ease you lack this
Coast to coast, we pop up on your scene like toast
Playin' host to your regiment
Who rally to boast, but now boast no more
They got floored by the sight of my ledger print
I came specifically, to fracture yo' ability
To grandstand anywhere next to me
This is the year, when the true better man
Keeps the cheddar and writes to his destiny 
Timeless episodes of talent got me nominated
By the ones who hated me on spittin' tighter
Salute these supa emcees for bein' clever
And never use the weed as a ghost writer

Contrary to popular truth, these youth are runnin' scared
So in one stare they gettin' strapped
Cash rules nuttin' from below the belt
The dick choose to melt asses where them dollars at? 
 musta been bitten by a rabbit
Actin' silly like that
Your pop culture need a diaper change
I'm snatchin' the mic, like I'm lootin'
With a whole lot of shootin' while you're keepin' out of sniper range
Your aim's to please, my aim's to freeze
You dead center in your tracks with your hands high
Ain't no tricks, we set it to fire like Hendrix
All the hard rocks at liquor spots
All over the scene, makin' it messy
So we make a clean getaway to a better day
Can't say the same, for them cats who left the game
Cause they couldn't claim the better pay
This ain't no masquerade
So the mass parade of people need to stop frontin'
There's truly a few makin' them hits
While us, we got our mitts closed cause you on the field buntin'
Make it to third bass, but never reach home
The word is, your whereabouts is unknown
While we're that point of view, that you never really knew
With the stitch to keep the cut sewn 

Rock a bye baby!! On the tree top!!
When the wind blows!! The cradle will rock!!
Rock!!...

I am Trugoy
A Dove-like boy
Could wingspread
But instead
I will employ

Me be Plug Three
Or Baby Huey
I eat up
All ketchup
For its tendency

I am Plug One
I'm 19 years young
I love peace
Well at least
I think we need some

I'm Q-Tip y'all
3 Feet produced by Prince Paul
This session
Was lessoned
By one Qualiall

I am Granny
Thank discoriety
The 3, 4
Yo, no more
I need peace for me

I'm China
I'm Jette
The Cue Cards we inject
We're crazy for Daisies
When we're on the set

Will rise, not fall
Definition, Prince Paul
The Mentor
Don't be sore
When I say
That's all

Now, where the ladies at? 
Yo, we're chillin' over here
And all the fellas? 
Takin over this year
I heard the party's round here, right? 
You know that's right
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Now, where the ladies at? 
Yo, we're chillin' over here
And all the fellas, the fellas? 
Takin over this year
I heard the party's round here, right? 
You know that's right
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey

It's so real when we come through
Sunshine be on my sidewalk when I come through
Schoolly d like family reunions
Midday may, it's all lovin'
Take a walk down to d dot c
The war's tuggin'
And ain't no druggin'
My credit's a gain
While you searchin for some trick
To put the shit in her name
I be spendin on wall street
And buyin' boardwalk
Dodging problems of the world
Drawn out in white chalk
Peace, mr. war
I'm seein' all dimensions
But unlike your eye extensions
My vision don't blur
'what' 'when' and 'word's
Where the gossip occur
Heard I'm sexin' sade
And I bought her a fur
Battin' eyes at toni braxton
And I bought her a fur
Now I'm hittin' whitney houston
Oh, she bought me a fur? 
Far-fetched like glass teks
And kiddie rolex
Soon comin'
But now it's time to kick the fun in
Now, where the ladies at? 
Yo, we're chillin' over here
And all the fellas? 
Takin over this year
I heard the party's round here, right? 
You know that's right
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey

I'm pourin out these rhymes
For them kids who ain't here
Stakes is high
But we gonna try to have fun this year
Before there were guns
There was native tongues on these plains
But others on
Without them being pawns in this game
'cause a pawn in this game
Is left with no game to play
So, um, you best ta check
And hear what we got to say
Now if you came to party
Just let it be known
Now if you came to fight
You might get that head flown
By the one and only
Maseo plug third
J.d. dove plays the wall
As kenny cal spurts words
And a number
To a crew of dope girls from the woods
And not dope meaning weed
But dope meaning 
Like them west coast kids
Who be throwin' up signs
I hate a buster
Unless his name is busta rhymes
So check the way my mind moves
Over times and grooves
Got some money to blow
Wonder why wanna know
Where the ladies at? 
Yo, we're chillin' over here
And all the fellas, the fellas? 
Takin over this year
I heard the party's round here, right? 
You know that's right
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey

(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Uh-huh! All right now! Oh yeah! Yo! Word! Oh! Yeah!
Uh-huh!)

Yo yo yo yo! We got De La Soul in the house, the producer Prince Paul
P.A. Mase, and I wanna know one
Thing! Yo, yo! You gotta show right up your hands, let me hear you say
Aa-ow!

Tell that brother, come on, tell him "Take
A Luuden!"

Say take a Luuden!

Plug Two!

Sto-o-op! Here we go!
If you like to drink some soda, let me hear you say Coca-Cola!

Coca-Cola!

Stop!

Ah yeah, pump it, pump it, ah yeah, pump it up!
You if you got doo doo in your pocket, you got doo doo in your pocket
Put one hand in the air like this, wave it
Back and forth, say doo doo!

Say doo doo!

Come on! Ah yeah!

Yeah yeah this is Plug Three! This is Plug Three! Yeah! Say hoo!

Hoo!

Hey De La Soul, you fucking lasagne heads, that's better than my mama's
Lasagne! Hey! Hey, come on! That was
Freakin' A, man! I really wanna take it back home with me, you know! I
Really get into your fuckin' music! It's so
Excellent! Ah, you big sconzilli heads! De La Soul's so fuckin' great!

Let me hear you say 'I like to eat that'

It's a dog eat dog competition  
I'll be gone like you're wishin  
'Cause i ain't got time 
For hangin around 

When you're fuckin' my love 
In all the wrong places 
It's a dog eat dog competition  
I'll be gone like you're wishin  

'Cause i ain't got time 
For hangin around 
When you're fuckin' my love 
In all the wrong places 

Extra  extra 
What's that all about? 
I'm wishin the position 
Of my loving's sorted out 

I shed a tear cause i'm hearin' 
Nothing new or particular 
Status once parallel 
Now it's perpendicular 

And everything is just as clear as day 
Realistically explicit 
In the things you say 
I guess a "bitch" in the batter's 

Gonna make the flavor fatter 
But you gots to keep it for real 
Forget about your jewels and gems 
You won't be needin 

None of them 
The tool'll fix the era 
My mellow used to wear a 
Namebuckle, now he chuckle 

'Cause he earn a dime Quicker 
Talkin bout a burnin' 
Sippin on some malt liQuor 
And all these kiddies 

Wishin they were supa emcees 
But to earn my "s" 
I had to learn some less 
About a crime'll make million 

A dime'll make a call 
I'd rather hop on the line 
And drop a rhyme to prince paul 
'Cause it's a dog eat dog competition  

I'll be gone like you're wishin  
'Cause i ain't got time 
For hangin around 
When you're fuckin' my love 

In all the wrong places 
Hey kid 
What's the word? 
Man, it's all about mind 

Keeping focused 
On them self-mechanisms of rhyme 
So no longer stand erect 
'Cause your thoughts are drained 

Walkin' round 
Manifesting attributes of shame 
Used to sQuabble for the mic 
But now accordingly 

We act 
Unless a club can't afford the fee 
We act 
So name that any best man 

To put us under 
Created from the ground 
Yet know nothin 
'Bout the under 

Take a glimpse 
At them pimps 
Playin record exec 
Addin up all your zeros 

So's to cut you a check 
Saying why the blunder wonder 
Could've g'd today 
So you can put up some swings 

For your seed to play 
But a swing ain't that important 
When the park's around the corner 
Filled with life causing death 

Greeting victims for the morning 
It was the moment i feared 
Nah, the moment i steered 
Upon the right path 

To know the right math 
To over stand 
It's a dog eat dog competition  
I'll be gone like you're wishin  

'Cause i ain't got time 
For hangin around 
When you're fuckin my love 
In all the wrong places

I be that mind blessin' blessin' these lessons we've ignited 
Want to bring it to my face man you're cordially invited 
'Cause I've cited  you possess no science in your thinking 
So I'm gonna  you're blinking! 

Fingers be pointin' and leakin' falsifyin' the stink 
You think I'm pink I bl l link with them shades of thought and think 
 so play on William Rhodes 
'Cause at the sound of the bell my circle square controls 
And all MC's best sweat, we bringin' buckets of heat 

So don't fret kid I let you lick the love I secrete, yo 
Even my foes give me bravos, and that shows 
Total domination in this rhyme complication 

Yeah the skill is a cinch I rock the womb with a mic 
And in the days of the nickel and breast, I knew de yes yes y'allin'
Was the callin', clearly not for the gat 
For combat, I bring a bag of my rhymes for the SAT 

I'm Plug One-of-a-kind, for you people's delight 
And for you sucker MC's, step to your knees 
Ain't no second thoughts and all your thoughts are from Orion 
I can tell that you a devil by them rhymes you're designin' 
Your play doggin' tactics can't fuck with my facets 
Just because you talk all that glock shit don't mean you can rock 
Shit! 
Your identities on freeze 
Just a form of protozoa tryin' to cross them seas 

See high horse riders gettin' shot by the sheriff 
'Cause nobody's safe for crimes 
And even all you skirts need to checkin' in your upstairs attic 
'Cause Mase is smackin' hoes if hoes is startin' static 

Now it ain't all good when your jam goes wood 
So as a deterrent, I use mental current 
Got them brothers shook, peep the look comin' out of the face 
'Cause they all catch a bruise from the hits we make 
Your fame and cars should be listed as magnets 
Legends never die but they can get shot and killed 
Ain't nuttin' glitter when you're battlin MC's 
You once imitated in a mirror so to down syndrome you kneel 

The same status I heard, the same nothin' 
My ears fears the faulty locks tryin' to lock down the stops 
But I earn more than your Menudo or your Boyz II Men 
While down syndrome keeps you immune to frequencies I send 
Fresher than a sniff off havin' them J in fifth 
I identify with your rhythm 
But I exist for more than just a Benz, so mends 
I'm cuttin' off my friends to keep a smile calicum iron grain 

Let me tell you a little something about Soul  
I be a piece of the East coast, so give a toast to 
Plug Wonder why back in the day who soaked his words in jigga 
So when I ran a phrase in June you didn't catch it til December 
I'm a member of them kids from the inner city 
Giving you kitties audible treats, you be aching for making 
More money than a pagan holiday 
Not from the PJ's, yet I still got something to say 

Say what man? You gritty like a diamond grenade 
For the cameo spot you tries to fool Parade 
You acrobats flip the star gazin' map, for alla that 
You'll be the first to place, and ran it all to a waste 
And all the style that you bring  
You gotta rip it from the start 

In rap goes apartment leave your chart bent off of hits
And catch mad love with a mix
Scream on fire like grits, and make sure the shine spits
Do away with all ignorance
Look out for the roaches and the pits mr. burns beware

I be the mr. bern like the bernstein bears
Keep it sloppy like joe, cuz joe don't care
But as long as I maintain savoirfaire
And the bums on the street chump change I spare
Keep it slick like james brown hair, do
Keep it raw like the z ave crew, true
The temperature's high up, or h-d
If the last thing's a booger you can't count on me
I'm a give a cockroaches, mos definitely

Now the apartment is getting kinda hot up in here
I guess a de la soul jam's been placed in your ear
Added sugar to the thoughts of the inner-city circle
Who might have to hurt you on a night that's late
When you're in the wrong town picking up your date
I guess your date wasn't set on having you for a mate

Chorus: dove

Sweet dreams are made of these
Who am i, to disagree? 
I travelled the world and the seven seas
And everybody, say it's gotta be funky

We be the suns party people rotate around the fun
 one never played no guns
I specialize in never putting wool over the eyes
This is the tower of stain that wouldn't be surprised
If you didn't apply it to the ordinary skin
I'm a mc in love with the way-back-when
Match pens to pad, I be ayamo's dad
Doing laundry to clean up on reality's fad

Now we in a sticky situation but we make it fon-kay
And bring it back to the days of watching pu-nky
Brewster, used ta, be in l.i. flats
With the bricks, jibbin this and that, upon tracks

We came to thank kids, not the blankets, but the towel
Shed love with the verb and the vowel
Move grooves like a bowel, de la representer
See funky is the way we keep it settin in your dreams like that

Chorus 2x

Teah yeah, gonna keep it real for the apartments in your area
Yeah, gonna move it like this everybody just funk in your area
Pos one's in your area, maseo's in your area
Too much plug, two much plug
Plug two's in your area
De la's in the area
Attic entertainment
Peace

I'm buggin'

Yep, yep, big trucker man's rollin' in town
How ya do, how ya do
I got the joints to make ya

Because I'm headin' eastbound
Tired of the merry go round and around

And everybody's talkin' 'bout you're so funny
But they still tellin' lies to me
I got the trees in my backyard
And it's hard for them to tell a lie to me

And who's the foot, I'm the foot but who's steppin'

You know where I'm steppin'
Skirts play wit it 'cause I'm slick like that
I'm the greatest MC in the world

You gots to gimme, gimme mine
'Cause I'm heavy when I weigh it
Watch the way I say it

Change my pitch up, smack my bitch up, I never did it
The flavor's bein' butt but brothers ain't gettin' it

Get it or else you're a goner
When I rolls over ya gonna have to wanna lamp
'Cause it's the chattanooga champ
Takin' a train, takin' a train, takin' a train, takin' a train

Now I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Well, I'm the hourglass cat
Drug it out of jack
For Jill

'Cause I spilled the phenomenon
Pack the holes in my lawn
The girls in my sauna
Word is born I'm a livin' phenomenon

Well, I'm a better brand 'cause I'm a Superman
I run the block with my circle 'cause I'm Nubian
I got the platinum rust, so don't even fuss
'Cause DJ Paul, he's down wit us

Now people stop takin' my stylin' for a joke
I don't sassafrass I put the foot up the ass
Sometimes I'm fast, blow off like a seal
When they reminisce over you
For real

Mase chopped the record down to the bone
And now Renee King is on my telephone
But I got the ring, ring, ha, ha, hey, hey
'Cause this type of shit it happens everyday
I got to make me a connection so my imports stuff

Wo, word 'em up, 'cause I'm so fly
Yes on and on
I'm ins like  go buy my yacht
I got Gills like Johnny, sail at 7 elf

Bigger than bigs, dig it

Ways that amazes popes

I am the is equals is 'cause it's caught up
When the tides taught me the ropes
No weights for the baits

For a verb unheard of

Alright you got it if you're special
With a dapper toe tapper when a lot's goin' on

The answer to the riddle is me and here's the question

Who can be

Yo, somebody's cryin' here

Ya go beats, meats, son sheep
I can't cook, but being a cook I'm servin' much to eat
I got multiple stabs of jazzy
Sassafrassy as I caught the fame of soul
Years after mama had me tell ya gladly
I plugged for the tunin'
Which cause eyes to zoom in

Which put your person into focus

No longer kelvin mercer but the posdnuos
Plug one yo I found fun
In the scribblin' of speak
On a naked white sheet
Most recognized by my dark brown self

Yo you found some wealth?

More in my mind than in my pocket
But I's got every girbaud that ever sagged
I met some hoes, met some girls
Did a tour that took me all around the world

Did a tour that took me all around the world

I hit the shines but I'm shooin' it now
Remember when the floor might have had a spine
Well it's all bent over
The dayglo nigga gets the red door mat
It's a roller coaster
When your shit's burnt toast
Now Mr. club owner knows your jam
When your jam is tha jam
And there's a tab at the bar
My mindstate's great
No thanks I don't drink
I sip the bobo
Then I kettle it quick
I felt the heave in the jeave
Tap it in the basement
Diggin' my own understanding quick
Let me get the single out
Think mr. radio say the starlight
Is the same star bright
I'm thinkin' how a nine and a blunt is a switch
But turn out the lights and some will go bitch
It was one mc after one mc
Play the lamp post do the blow wit dynomite
Well it's okay and it's alright
Cause our birthday cake's external light
It'll all get graphic
People made of plastic
Look at the shine wit my 50 watt eye
But when I got the eye patch I hit the latch
I fame it to a name from denver up to maine
And lovin' deluxe
She won't catch me in no tux
Nah, man I won't honor the style

Dres: how you doing, my name is dres, listen
Shorty: isn't that posdnuos? oh, my
Dres: baby, what's wrong with me?

Funny funny how time flies
When you have some light on the face
Cause the focus is the fickle
'stead of fusin' I'm a use it
To the utilize the trickle caught the rush
But I play hush
While andres titus is the grabbin'
As a fan will put the hearts to mush
Lush dalea would hear the public beat
The same way for titus when he blacked the sheep
But as the knee went deep
To deeper off the charts
The album faded to black
That's when the amnesia starts

Shorty: aren't you dres from black sheep? 
What are you doing here? who
Are you here with?
Dres: I'm with my man pos, you know pos
Shorty: oh yeah, positive k, I like him

Hey boy, I watch that star man, shit's all in
Should I shot it or begin
I saw bootleggas no shinin'
I saw big 4 go get shinin'
A typical flick was the moment
When the man said
"Ain't you?" yeah I is 'im
Hush your mouth fallin' in cog
Caught the light being true dog
A fist of funk and I pocket that screen
In the scene or in between
Gimme but a little bit of the starlight
I mail my ass to the darkness
I dig it, I dug it
I dig it, I dug it
I wiz it, I was it
I wiz it, I was it
Oh lord let me switch it off
Because ya find some'll do it all
For the light

Ya go beats, meats, son sheep
I can't cook, but being a cook I'm servin' much to eat
I got multiple stabs of jazzy
Sassafrassy as I caught the fame of soul
Years after mama had me tell ya gladly
I plugged for the tunin'
Which cause eyes to zoom in

Which put your person into focus

No longer kelvin mercer but the posdnuos
Plug one yo I found fun
In the scribblin' of speak
On a naked white sheet
Most recognized by my dark brown self

Yo you found some wealth?

More in my mind than in my pocket
But I's got every girbaud that ever sagged
I met some hoes, met some girls
Did a tour that took me all around the world

Did a tour that took me all around the world

I hit the shines but I'm shooin' it now
Remember when the floor might have had a spine
Well it's all bent over
The dayglo nigga gets the red door mat
It's a roller coaster
When your shit's burnt toast
Now Mr. club owner knows your jam
When your jam is tha jam
And there's a tab at the bar

Greetings girl and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

Eye know Eye love you better

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true

Eye know Eye love you better

Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Take my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me cause

Eye know Eye love you better

It's I again and the song that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you posess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how
Eye know Eye love you better

(Thank you, thank you, and for my latest basket of cherries, here it
Goes, baby!)
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind, mess up my mind wit the eye patch
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind, mess up my mind wit the eye patch
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind, mess up my mind wit the eye patch

Channeling in sync so my would bring 
Wit dat, causin' all fat I'm responsible for ya diet

Yo I got beats. State this stitch on my national fabric
My daughter will speak the arabic that's how I lift
Levitate to my nation when holding up your nickels
I pie like crumble so I Don like Rickles
Like green on the pickle
My papes are the up master of the cabbage patch

Ya eyes got the latch

So catch the cut, I hold the rut
For the people's reminder when in Maseo Path
I be the finder of the patch

Can the cat's tongue slip, ya do the 'da dip'
Take the horse into the jolly ranch
Keep the hush
The good, the bad, and Uncle Tom, beat it kid

Do doo doo do do do do do
Show the sheep cause I found the food
When I string the man wit the eye patch
The eye patch
When I'm walkin' it and could ya make it go sha na na na

It sniffs good
Punks show disguises when I'm standing in the wood
I be the in cause the brother holdin' Glocks is out
I be the in cause the pusher runnin' blocks is out
I be the in cause the kid smokin' weed
Shootin' seed which leads to a girl's stomach
Being 'bout a half a ton is out
Show the finger print
And give me good grief for my lumber
Pants will sag cause I'm licensed as a plumber
Feel the Plug

Now give a shout

DOVE: Yo what's up, I'd like to give a holler to Big 7 off in the
Oakenone!
POS: And I bring an income in to my baby girl Twyla in White Plains and
All my peoples out in Delaware
MASE: Yeah yeah yeah, and I like to give a shout out to all those
Rappers who dissed us on records, and I wanna
Let you know you're still wack
And oh yeah, I ain't mentioned no names cause you might f

Travelling at the speed of love
Hey kids, what's up
Remember when I used to be dope, yeah
I owned a pocket full of fame

But look what you're doing now, Well I know, I know
I lost touch with reality, now my personality
Is an unwanted commodity 
Can't believe I used to be Mr Steve Austin on the mike

 I used to run it
I guess Oscar Goldman got mad
'Cause I got loose circuits 
I seen the mother goose with the eggs that seemed to be

Fallin Fallin Fallin
You played yourself 

Yo pack my bags cause I'm out of here
My momma don't love me and my momma don't care
Read the papers the headlines say
Washed up rapper got a song 

I knew I blew the whole fandango
When the drum crew never wore a Kangol
Never could be like fake, fish won't bite bait
Realize that I'm over like clover

No good lucking so Maze hit the fucking beat
While the teenage fans are here
I bring it to the blues, I pay all my dues
So what's gone dead, let me use my forehead

Easy pack it up man, let me stop stalling
'Cause everything I do is like falling

Falling Falling
You played yourself

Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody do the baseball
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody do the baseball
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Come on everybody let's baseball

A Nubian sprocket is the one
Plug One, cut the cap
Forward is the marcher of the chant
To the clan, unless you slept
Willy to the Wonka of the feat
Smoke your blunt, but close your drapes
If we get fined by police
Don't worry, yo, I got the papes
Toxic is the talk that I tell
Tell the tales from the lady who's fat
Chris made the dope beat but no Bo Peeps

Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody do the baseball
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody do the baseball
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Come on everybody let's baseball

Swing is the is of my step
Plug Two, groove a gut
On gets by when it's kept
Three miles to my step
Forgiveness to the foes is false
I cook goose and serve a plate
Position is opposed to a loss
No cost, no relate
Brother got a badge of his own
Because the link of the life is slack
This licks 'em down to the Tootsie Pop

Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody do the baseball
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody do the baseball
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Come on everybody let's baseball

Move over just a bit to the right of me
For I cannot see where the booty is
I sit, I'm looking out a foggy window
Crack it just a bit, yo this is showbiz
It's as though a pound goes around and around
So I give a pound then I do the step
Dres will be with Boca on the side
Can I crack a smile for doz who slept
Phonetics and kinetics perservere
Therefore I kick it
I took the L.I.R.R. but I did not have a ticket
Had some Chinese food but I didn't have a spoon
I had a dope rhyme but I didn't have it soon
I'm looking out the window
Day is filled with rain and gloom
Man oh man oh man I hope I find my spoon soon
Eating large fish cause I know it ain't cat

Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody do the baseball
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody let's baseball
Come on everybody do the baseball
Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Come on everybody let's baseball

City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go 'cause they don't know whack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing, 'cause I don't get sleep, no

Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love has freely
Turned forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here 
Care Bear rappin' in harder this year 
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us

Who you foolin.. only foolin 

Yo, I stay cousin to this, introducing Mr. Dave Banner
Scannin proper with my sight muscle
This rap shit, is just my night hustle
My J-O's to stay fearin of my G-O-D
Whether what may, meet me at the front door
See the pressure got a nigga knockin shit off his desk
Cause of the stress I stack words make cats bruise they neck tissue
Stay pertinent to the issues
Cut your tag too close, display these verses tight, virtuals
sort of like we supposed to, pantyhose raps you run
Stay  like black folks some 
mostly fakin it, to make it

I play low-key til it's time for you to know me
Stir my lime with light, drink it down slowly
Holy shit! Now look what I get
A whole string of party people want to run in my mix
In my world they want to fit like melanin in a tit
Jam tight, they ain't my fam alright? They ain't my people
Them niggaz screamin fam til they rank measure equal
then vote, without leavin a note, and that was all she wrote
Arranged produced my slang's obtuse
but some distort, tellin stories like Mother-the-Goose
My true fam's  back since with Vince Mason
We'll draw on three, leave that body for the tracin
Ultimate high, like them drugs you be lacin
Coulda stood next to me, at the top of the key
but you had to play gutter, didn't want to climb
Now you find yourself talked about in my rhyme

While you fools claim corners, we gon' claim theories
why'all some stickball niggaz, we the World Series
Been here, just pleadin the same case
ever since we spaced about "3 Feet"
Pinchin your ears, inchin for years
but you still stuck at the mezzanine and
we at the penthouse level with the same old rugs
same old tubs, same old tables and same faults
Same crew and the same old train of thought
Chorus: De La Soul
My guess you need to head West 
Thought we'd fall for your phonyness you're 
yourself, thought you were down - it takes more than a smile
and a couple of pounds to be crew
Man you bound to get your tail caught 
Spreadin yourself thin see you're 
yourself, thinkin all you need is the wealth
You need to peep your whole circle out

Yo, since Jam Master Jay been rockin without a band
and that sister k.d. lang been sexin without a man
we brought our ultimate plan to birth
Put in work for this game, it's not a game to me
We've been furnished the props
Now we out to furnish properties we own
That's right  cats might know we ain't home
My throne's threatened by fiends, try to do dirt
Play Tony Randall - have that ass cleaned

Unveiled I see your exhibition, why'all need to cover that
Fatherless styles, why'all really need to mother that
Same expose, different page
but when you see me in it it's the same old Dave

why'all silly, you're just a civili', I'm a soldier
Troopin in this path til the death won us over
So if life is a party begin, to understand
just like the DJ, we stayin to the end
Chorus: De La Soul
How you think you gon' get away? 
Changin faces on the regular you're 
yourself, big top status, paintin your face
Who you think you really gonna fool huh?
We watch, what we got so 
around on my premises you're 
you, into thinkin you can break in too
my place, and not have to face, our position
Who you foolin.. only foolin

Who you foolin.. only foolin

Ex cape the fire tonight switch like Jekyll and Hyde 
and shit wreckin we live and shit 
This swamp water style'll keep em dirty and wet 
I bet mills on the rhyme skills we walk away set 
Rich like topsoil connect coin with currency 
Places that I couldn't pronounce, and then bounce 
Illegal ain't illegal if it's less than an ounce 
Keep it come in T. La Rock amounts, see +It's Yours+ 
Study scrolls that includes the clause 
Get your dirty paws out my bowl, your hustle's too old to deal 
with the shuffle, you exhaust me like a muffle 
Get zapped and zipped in the duffle 
Came to the set splashed, no Roley on the wrist 
To Hell with a guest list, we all up in this! 
A two dollar somethin got your eyes on him 
But yo she pinchin my ass so we go, limb for limb 
Lights studio dim, it's EXACT tonight 
So we can drop the Rap Delight, on one! 

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
"Just get on down" 

Underground under pressure, my style is the child 
of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad 
The sign of in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge 
Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj 
I take over breaks and chop loops 
Glorifyin, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops 
Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose 
Datin game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Pos'nus 
Before you get a style, let's get a style 
My style has the crowd back and forth 
You were soft as the tracks you rappin off, I pop shit 
You tried to laugh it off, actin like you had to cough 
and didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern 
emcee, familiar sample period; spottin where you sampled 
your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it 
I drop science and experiment -- contractually 
came to terms of endearment with my label 
Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggaz, I contact niggaz 
like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows 
Wipin your nose like you need blows 
Claimin it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats 
or is it how they word it 
If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with 
Thoughts for a minute, I rode rhythms and words tenant 
Many lip profess, I'm verb sentences 

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
"Just get on down" 

It's like rip why'all, add it on to lip 
Wonder Why's upon this, just to flex my strength 
I was the one who killed wackness so I had to do a bid 
of twelve years on the mic, before parole with Tommy 'Kid' 
Infinite landscaper, green paper maker 
Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims 
Man these people still takin rappin for a joke 
The pimp, I rock it one-double-oh percent 
Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide 
on the mic exposin your polluted bloodtype 
why'all niggaz need a visit from the Brain Fairy 
Walk around dead, like your physical's buried 
Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's 
shaky as SHIT! Just need to come clean and admit 
that yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless 
My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless 
Your crew couldn't even measure to mine 
That's why yo' bitches is busted, and mines is fine 
Performin with an upper design, so back on off the plank 
We bringin this Big and Bad like Hank 

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
"Just get on down.." 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down 
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin 
Just dance, ah come on and get down!
"Just get on down"

That's a fib, she had two twins though
And one crib
Now she's only fourteen, what a start
But this defect is ground common in these parts
Now life in this world can be such a bitch
And dreams are often torn and shattered and hard to stitch
Negative's the attitude that runs the show
When the stage is the g-h-e-t-t-o

Which is the one to blame when bullets blow
Either peter, jane, or john or joe
But joe can't shoot a gun, he's always drunk
And peter's pimping jane, and john's a punk
Infested are the halls, also the brains
Daddy's broken down from ghetto pains
Mommy's flying high, the truth is shown
The kids are all alone
Cause it's just the ghetto thang

It's just the ghetto thang 

Who ranks the baddest brother, the ones who rule
This title is sought by the coolest fool
Define coolest fool? easy, the one who needs
Attention in the largest span and loves to lead
Always found at the jams, but never dance
Just provoke violence due to one glance
The future plays no matter, just the present flow
When the greeting place is the g-h-e-t-t-o

Lies are pointed strong into your skull
Deep within your brain against the wall
To hide or just erase the glowing note
Of how to use the ghetto as a scapegoat
Truth from trugoy's mouth is here to scar
Those who blame the g for all bizarre
So open up your vents and record well
For this is where we stand, for the true tell
Ghetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways
Now there could be some ghetto gangs and ghetto play
If ghetto thang can have its way in ghetto range
Then there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change
Though confident they keep it kept, we know for fact
They lie like ghettos form, cause people lack
To see that they must all get out the ghetto hold
The truth they never told
Cause it's just the ghetto thang

It's just the ghetto thang 

Do people really wish when they blow
Out the cake candles, and if so
Is it for the sunken truth which could arise
From out the characters in which the ghetto hides
Roses in the ring supply their shown relief
Granted it's planted by their shown belief
Kill and feed off your own brother man
Has quickly been adopted as the master plan
Posses of our people has yet to provoke
Freedom or death to them, it's just a joke
What causes this defect, I don't know
Maybe it's the g-h-e-t-t-o

It's just the ghetto thang 

Standing in the rain is nothing felt
When problems hold more value, but never dealt
With buildings crumbling to the ground
Impact noise is solid sound
But who's the one to say this life is wrong
When ghetto life is chosen strong
We seem to be misled about our dreams
But dreams ain't what it seems
When it's just the ghetto thang

It's just the ghetto thang 

"Oh, whaddya know?  He comes."

Down, like water, fresh out the clouds, clown.
Drown you like terrible weather.
Nobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon.
Most rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin'.
To all - rise and shine; give God the glory.
I already give a percent of mine to Bert and Cory,
And still got bills and employees to pay.
So excuse me, Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days.
My ways of control is hard to swallow.
Known to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind.
Sorry to dis-appoint, but dis joint's mine.
Dis-play your indie, but say no more or I'll blind you like spit did to Remo.
To the dirt, and edit the clip and lost Kano.
My mens wear problems like Timbs.
See it all in they face; ask Mase, he got wars to win,
Scores to settle, crews to crush.
You rush right in to see him do it with a smile.
It's Long Isle y'all; longevity sustainin' my celebrity status.
From A-M to P-M, you see him on file, y'all.
I was told to step righteous, so when it's done
Everyone will say I stepped right.
And whether through religion, or stopped by the cop,
Shinin' his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light.

"A few short words, and whaddya know?"
"Oh, whaddya know?  He comes."

Aiyyo, I'm up against these walls; here's my back, stiff, straight up.
Dazzle and razzlin' broads like I'm little Juan Magic.
Magnetically handle mics, they don't drop.
Top drama every time these commas don't drop.
Pop spots like lint on your shirt; the net worth.
To shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball;
Four couldn't do it, so we bring all six.
I circumcise the track; you just a dick, overlapped and hooded.
Skin repeated like Stutterin' John.
I repeat like yesterday; it don't stop.
George of this poor life, pop, put to Scarlet;
In a place she believes much better than your lies.
She say she lookin' better in my eyes; bullshit!
Same crock she done ran to duck, crammin' to fuck.
I put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby.
I tried to speak my piece in court, but Judge Mills paused me.
Bifocusedly die, hopeless sometimes.
Yo, cry your poker face; you oughta try it one time.
When God is an non pos' you stand to download.
Demanded like slaves on trial; we want free.
Man, cock aim ready; it's time you MC.
So you rappers bust bibi guns; graffiti runs
Through my veins, since cable with the wired remote.
Woodgrainin' like you wired his float.

C'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul.
We was rhymin' through the frozen street since eight years old.
Take us back to eighty-eight; you couldn't catch our flow.
A group of kids so original.

 
You heard?

Tony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners; who got 'em?
We kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew and his whack dancers.
Bitin' is forbidden, pah, pay that tax.
And don't you ever look at us funny, boy, we'll bring rap back.
And that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men.
With dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in.
For you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn.
Hula hoop all bitches; crew full with brand new Keds.
Cutmaster kill 'em; make sure we cut classics.
Buck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets.
Next to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the P-A,
And just lay whooptay, whooptay?
Use the ruse, sport beads, and snatch a dude's toupee.
Since tunin' into T-La Rock'n A-J,
Ghostface gats is freshed squeezed, like a glass of O-J.
Girls, you can go cruisin' in my O-J.

"A few short words, and whaddya know?"
"Oh, whaddya know?  He comes."

Around me, bringing down, ah yea yea yea yea yeah
Life

This is dedicated to all my folks
Diagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin'
And never took the time to fall in line or follow
Or swallow the thoughts

Of the recognized committees who lurk throughout ya cities
Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type
You from the same type of people try to hold you down
Just because you tailor made for bigger and better things

Never missed a chance to move ahead of things
And what does it bring? I tell you for me
It brought jealousy in back wounds from all the stabbin'
Cats posin' as my fan just to get grabbin' what's mine

I'm livin' in times where my daughters are found around
Kids who can't afford thinkin' caps
But always found drinkin' raps and eatin' off beats
Claimin' laws of the streets, but who made the laws?
Everybody playin' rebel with no sign of a cause

Well I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down, just to be down
You've got to make up your mind, where you want to be
Where you want to go with your life
With your life

I'm never singin' the blues but findin' the clues to maintain
And I been blessed to reign supreme over nearly every dream
I had, and I made it come true
I'm an imperfect man and I'm holdin' the clue

To perfection, it doesn't seem to matter what direction I look
I find people settin' traps
Tryin' to find the goal, without havin' any maps
Even friends of mine, jumped online, just to become my adversary

They felt they were entitled to the dairy I made
They don't come to chill or behave

And they got, toast ready to burn
Not learnin' to live, but they yearnin' to take what you earn

Well I feel the world around me
I've found, that others will bring you down, just to be down
You see, you've got to make up your mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with your life
With your life

So quick to place blame, and deny the shame we bring upon ourselves
So many names held accountable for my own account
When a large amount was weighed, that I made and shaped
When I climbed I found

It was hard to find others around to point my fingers at
Which made me realize the truth
The biggest suppressor could be your own ego lookin' for an excuse
To plant roots, in a field of self-sorrow

To sprout and follow the first thing you feel
Nourishes your hunger to be respected, it gets hectic
And when I'm watchin' the news, and my daughter walks in
And choose to ask, 'Why were all those people on the floor
Sleepin', covered in red?' I told her
That they were lookin' for God, but found religion instead

Well I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down, just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with yo' life
With your life, with your life

Oh, bring you down
Sometimes, you got to walk alone, alone
Oh, yeah, I need, ooh, to breathe
I need my space, to live
Y'all know, y'all know, oh

Well I, feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down just to be down
You see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you want to be
And where you want to go with yo' life
With your life, with your life

I am Posdnous 
I be the new generation of slaves 
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes 
The pile of revenue I create 

But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late 
Product of a North Carolina cat 
Who scratched the back of a pretty woman named Hattie 
Who departed life just a little too soon 

And didn't see me grab the Plug Tune fame 
As we go a little somethin' like this 
Look ma, no protection 
Now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay 

And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough 
So the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay 
I am an early bird but the feathers are black 
So the apples that I catch are usually all worms 

But it's a must to decipher one's queen 
From a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ 
I cherish the twilight 
I maximize, my soul is the right size 

I watch for the power to run out on the moon 
 
Faker than a fist of kids 
Speakin' that they're black 

When they're just niggas trying to be Greek 
Or some tongues who lied 
And said "We'll be natives to the end" 
Nowadays we don't even speak 

I guess we got our own life to live 
Or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule? 
Every now and then I step to the now 
For now I see back then I might have acted like a fool 

Now I won't apologize for it 
This is not a bunch of Bradys 
But a bunch of black man's pride 
Yet I can safely say 

I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside 
I've always walked the right side of the road 
If I wasn't making song I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs 
But a man with a plan 

And if I was a rug cleaner 
Betcha Pos'd have the cleanest rugs I am.  
The Plug Two brand with the flavour 
In the flute watch the sniffin' 

So a sack of shows in demand 
I read the diction from the second page 
I got the one-two gauge 
Baritone to the izm fan 

Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink 
So let me need ya to my ems go 
I push the infinite and carry it 
My carrier's the three over one 

So my pluggins already know 
Lick shots with moo 
Catch the boo 
From a ghost in the heckling crowd 

If I give a foot 
Jack Ville caught a spill 
When a still came from my mouth 
I brought a head down south 

I don't check for the noose and the neck 
So I never tell my ems 
That finesse is knocking at my door 
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun 

And dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore 
I bring the element H with the 2 
So ya owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade 
It's just mind over matter 

And what matters is 
That the mind isn't guided by the punished shade 
I keep the walking on the right side 
But I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong 

'Cause that's how he wants to be 
No difference, see 
I want to be like the name of this song I am 
I am Posdnous 

I be the new generation of slaves 
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes 
The pile of revenue I create 
But I guess I don't get a cut 'cause my rent's a month late 

The deeds of a natural 
Are seeds that are no longer planted 
So the famine in the mind is strong 
Tactics of another plane is now proven sane 

Sane enough to let you know from within this song 
I stabilize many cableized viewers 
So my occupation's known 
But not why I occupy 

And that is to bring the peace 
Not in the flower but the As-Salaam Alaikum in the third I am

If I want to I could jump off this building

I could hold two pieces of doo-doo in my hand

I could call everybody in that room a rubberneck

Come on, please?

I can say anything that I want

I could wave my hand in my air

I could stick my hand up my nose

I could hold my foot and count the toes

I can do anything

If I want to I could jump off this building

I could hold two pieces of doo-doo in my hand

I could call everybody in that room a rubberneck

Just to hang up place the name onto headline

"Appearing live De La Soul" first up to shine

It be me

While I arose from the shores from Long Isle

While little girls sport swollen stomachs like they in style

While their man hairline recedes cause they fashion from dust

That's why we all lust to live and ah live to lust

Down down will be some intricate word play comin' around

I'm not gay but I'm quick to say Mase is my man

We done rocked from NY to Osocka Japan

 I land back in NY

So don't test the world travelers we off to apply

Cash the check cuase we knows the D

Peace to all them MC's who got a child and record companies to feed

So all my thrillas over seas 

To all my thrillas makin' G's  "Hello"- 

Introducing doctor Oman to your section

To say these rhymes in your direction

See your selection keep me frownin' crown you niggas 

Shared a bottle with my crew and takin' swiggas 

Ain't no need to said no names we just revealin'

That my family keeps on top like a ceiling

Dealin' like a gamble ain't no ramble or roast

So how you call it when you niggas alcohol it?

I be calm in the corner soothing stress like a sauna

Gonna  take my time 

To raise my 

Inspired by Rick and Vance Wright

Trying not to boogie with the devil take my lessons just to keep my dance

tight

Phatter  than a waist 55 on the mic

And if ya wanna bug then do what cha like

Self expression makes it health for self aiight

Hey yo you feel that shit

Fixin with the ins for the outs we set
Hey shortie 
Make no mistake

Well I bugs like roaches on rugs
Speaker of the bone like the speaks in my loans
Give me the night baby and i'll be good in the woods
Ya freakin my mind ya freakin my mind
I told the maceo bout the days that go 
I know he know cuz he's out to get the gold
The Chattanooga cruisin' with the malibu shit
The bigger of the isa 
I'm like hickory 
I make you feel lost like high school history
Creator of the rhymin dominoes
Watchin drop it's the joint see
So hit me with the zsa zsa 
The coolest fool be the coolest fool
I know the watch be in the air but I kick a new bucket
Sippin it wit shortie so check the way we cuff it
It's that indonesia funk up in your trunk
Makin' ya bob bob makin' ya bob

It's that funky shit 
That be beyond understandin 
Yo we do it with the soul 
Timber 

Punch that O for operator baby its a love solid
I been stylin' abstract since loose leafs was the shit
Catch me breathin' on planes where the gangsta's outdated
Fuck being hard, Posdnuos is complicated
As my pants play the sagatogah I can order sniffs of
Frequencies frequencies cuz I freak mc's with the rhythm rock live

No jive in the matter so niggas start runnin'
Yo that native shit is dead so the stickabush is comin'
 it's comin  it's here
Fuck the five count it only takes three to bring it near
So let me move ya won better as the salad is tossed
And get a taste of the mase that you thought was lost

I'm cautious wit my looks 
Pickin them nines in my hair 
Sniffin for the beats like litter 
The plugs just can't be found 

Can I come off like the rest of em I think I should
Could I of course one verse now ya lost it
Found it realizing I came off it sounds mean
But pal there's a new kid on the scene
I got much soul on the down low tip
Lay back smooth one drink i'll be trippin
Never don't you dare consider me a fly gal
Pal I got props on a different tip
I recall back I go for mines I get the goods
Wouldn't you know forgot my compass I got lost in the woods
Found my way and I was out I pronounce every letter
And if I had the chance i'd do it better
I heard a holler down the way and now I'm out for the time being
Ya wanna be in but you can't see what I'm seein
Time and time my friend I stay gettin it on
And now they playin my song again

I got feminine style 
I'm not tryin to be sexy 
And no you can't knock the boots 
A lot of things be happenin

It's like, New York without a New York yanks
Better yet, New York without the New York franks
It's like hot summers without no A.C
Or never hitting numbers when you go to A.C
It's like six years of your life, go ask Rob
I'm like "Yo how is it?" he like "It's like hard"
Trying for that queen but you nothing but a man
You want to keep it clean but you can't
Why it gotta be, like, that
And what the life, see life is like a J shot
Shooters son, they got
One point one second, you half court
I'm feeling the adrenaline like you half court
Like pink slips and dipping these ink tips to paper
Imagine if we fuck around and lose Hip-hop
Imagine if it didn't exist
Imagine nothing shining your wrist
See, imagining to you is a risk
But think about it, like no chrome rims
And tims would be construction boots 
We probably wouldn't even substitute 
For words we use defining our likes
I'm coal mining these mics
To keep that gold nugget like Dave Megget
Giant like a motherfucker, like Dave said it
But ya ain't listening, ya paper gon' stack
Why it gotta be like that?

That, tha-tha-that, tha-that, tha-that, tha-that, tha-that, tha-that, tha-that, that
That, tha-tha-that, tha-that, that, tha-tha-that, tha-tha-that, that, that, tha-that, tha-that

Just running, running, fast as I can
I'm trying to be a person but I gotta be the man
If I, can't stand the life that I'm in
I gotta keep running 'cause I'm still gon' win
Yes I got to go on 
Yes I got to go on 

It's like, Slick Rick without the eye patch
More like, saying slick shit you won't catch
It's like bed time without your PJ's
Or no fed timing in out the PJ's
It's like, one minute you got it, then you broke
Like what I do with it? I copped a few with it
Looking like a problem, but you won't get it solved
You working but you won't get the job
It's like, who would of thought 
It you would of bought 
Into my religion you'd be more like God
But you were steady swimming so you more like cod
See these fools is fish scale, converting to ish male
See I see it like, A alike, be	 alike
I was taught, if you play alike, be alike
How they don't see it for one to go pop
And this is how you treat Hip-hop?
Imagine if you didn't have that phantom chrome sitting on a curb nigga
The word nigga wouldn't be a bit disturbing nigga
See them roots are like begging for the rain
You entering my kingdom just a begging for the reign
Putting shit stain to paper
Ink pain feeling like fifty-five licks on a slave niggas back
And not a one of y'all stopping to hate
But why it gotta be like that?

That, tha-tha-that, tha-that, that, that, tha-that, that, tha-tha-that, that, that
Tha-tha-that, tha-that, tha-tha-that, that, that, that, that, that, tha-that, tha-that, that

If money makes a man strange we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go round
If love is against the law listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's goin down

If money makes a man strange we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go round
If love is against the law listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's goin down

Fell in love with this fish who got caught in my mesh
But yo she burned my scene up like David Koresh
I guess a diamond ain't nothing but a rock with a name
I guess love ain't nuttin but emotion and game
It's a lesson well learned so praise is well due
I'm sendin off from Big I, to Kenny Calhoun
And add a reservation for the resident crew
And yo get your bowl cuz we cookin up stew
See them Cubans don't care what y'all niggas do
Colombians ain't never ran with your crew
Why you acting all spicy and sheisty
The only Italians you knew was icees, niggas price me
I'm keepin it clean, like a washing machine
And yo, get your locomotion run into full steam
I'm sending out a greeting to my man Daseem
I got a child so I gotsta get the green, right right

If money makes a man strange we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go round
If love is against the law listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's goin down

Itzsoweezee, it's gettin hot this year
Itzsoweezee, it's gettin hot

I own the deeds to some acres in the West Indies
Where my pops is building residence to house my seed
Now here's the lead, y'all niggas pray to hot rods and not God
While Versace play you niggas like Yahtzee
Crackin jokes like you Patzi

Blazin up your herb to escape the maze, but the problem stays
Think big get it big is my motto
You can go and play your lotto, I'll be singin like baby won't you be mine
You'll be pressin rewind, you can never see mine
Keep your eyes focused, you can't touch this or quote this
Style is crazy bogus so you can't try to approach this
Stomp you out like roaches, pullin on my coattail
Like some horses pullin coaches, WHOA your roller coasters
It's hotter than the temperature that's cookin in your toasters
While the heat'll put you deep into hypnosis

If money makes a man strange we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go round
If love is against the law listen I don't know
Gotta change how it's goin down

If money makes a man strange we gots to rearrange
So what makes the world go round

Fell in love with this fish who got caught in my mesh
But yo she burned my scene up like David Koresh
I guess a diamond ain't nothing but a rock with a name

Intro

This song...does not contain...explicit lyrics...but the thought... is
Erotic...

Awwwwwwwwww...baby!

Verse 1

Access to her cove, lovestruck dove is dove's mode
Took a look, dropped my books, jenifa, oh jenny
Breakfast was our greetings, yoghurts and birdseed's what I fed
Slipped a note, rock my yacht, jenifa, oh jenny
Jenny only thought about jimmy, but didn't think about derwin
The jimmy who's only a virgin
Steady we go, jenifa led, pluggin' a tune which freedom well said
So what's the fix, o jenifa, can a brother with soul get swingin'? 

Verse 2

The downstairs where we met, I'd brought records, she'd cassettes
Lost a break, found her shake, jenifa, oh jenny
Transcripts showed more than flirt, I love daisies read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, jimmy screamed, jenifa, oh jenny
Morals shaped like the floss, no-one could live their life for pos
Found her house, aroused my joust, jenifa, oh jenny
Her clothes I did shuck, just like dan I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried kick it!, posdnous was in
Jenny only thought about jimmy, but asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named derwin? 
She said, let's try it in the bathroom, but the 'nous is way above
Sinks
So to the kitchen she did dan and came back wrapped in saran

Verse 3

Positions, muscles flexed, dove was lost in a ghana hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy, jenifa, oh jenny
Notions soothed the mood, dove was lost in de la heaven
Scream plug 2, did the do, jenifa, oh jenny
Jenny teased my homeboy granny, in fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool
Did her thing while I plugged once, hope she don't fall fat 9 months
From now
I'll tell you what, trugoy ain't ready

Verse 4

Worned out was my cater, mind you, this was 3 days later
The door turned blue, you guess who, jenifa, oh jenny
Advanced to the radio, teddy persuaded us to turn off the light
Wanted me to rhyme while she wrapped me up in a ball of twine
No more I dispatch, was it jimmy had met his match? 
Or could it be the realisation all girls owned a jenny? 
For normal health I have fought, a valuable lesson she hath taught
Don't flaunt that the candy is good unless you came with plenty

Stooooop!!!!!!

Access to her code
Lovestruck was my mode
Took a look, dropped my textbook
Jenifa, 
Breakfast, broke it fast
She was in my english class
Asked for notes, rocked my boat
Jenifa 

Jenny
Lost her favourite penny
So I gave her a dollar
She kissed me

In a flash the school bell rang
Jenny grabbed on to my hand
Took me home and said, trugoy just
Swing and swing and swing

The downstairs, where we met
I brought records, she cassettes
Lost the breaks, found her shape
Jenifa, oh jenny

Transcripts showed more than flirt
"I love daisies" read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, jimmy screamed
Jenifa, oh jenny

Marvelous
Shaped like a vase
No one can live their life for pos
Found a house, aroused my joust
Jenifa, oh jenny

Her clothes, I did shuck
Just like dan I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried "kick it"
Posdnuos was in

Jenny
Only thought about jimmy
But asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named derwin?

She said "let's try it in the bathroom"
But 'dnuos is way above sinks
So to the kitchen she did dan
And came back wrapped in saran

Now wait a minute! little derwin got something to
Show us that jenny could never do, listen)

Hey look at little derwin, look at him go, look at him go!
Aw, baby

Positions, muscles flexed
Dove was lost in a ghana hex
Passed her test, felt her teddy
Jenifa oh jenny

Notions
Soothed the mood
Dove was lost in de la heaven
Screwed plug two, did the do
Jenifa oh jenny

Jenny
Teased my homeboy granny
In fact she teased so many
She was known as a garden tool

No more
I dispatched
Was it jimmy had met his match
Or could it be the realisation
All girls owned a jenny

For normal health
I had fought
A valuable lesson she had taught
Don't flaunt that the candy is good
Unless you came with plenty

Access to her code

Hey look at little derwin, look at him go, look at him go!

Don't flaunt that the candy is good
Unless you came with plenty

Oh Johnny, you got a bullet in your forehead, boy
Don't you understand, you're dead?
Buried six feet under the concrete

Ooh aww oh
That's the noise he made when he got shot
But Johnny's still dead, still dead

Thought about his mama
Thought about his father Josephine
But nobody could help the boy
When he hit the concrete

"Ooh aww oh"
The last words said by Johnny
But now he's six feet under and he's dead

Oh Johnny, you got a bullet in your forehead, boy
Don't you understand, you're dead?
Buried six feet under the concrete

Ooh aww oh
That's the noise he made when he got shot
But Johnny's still dead, still dead

Thought about his mama
Thought about his father Josephine
But nobody could help the boy
When he hit the concrete

"Ooh aww oh"
The last words said by Johnny
But now he's six feet under and he's dead

Jody got a cat but she won't let it out
Oh, tough luck, 'cause it makes Jack pout
Waiting on the wins he moves to the next
Searching for the cheese, looking for the text

In the Big Blue, in search of the skins
Grinning and laughing, laughing and grinning
Padlock Jody got the whole scene played
No knockin' boots till she's 14K'd

Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Waiting for the credit card so she can go and shop
Jack plays the back, just knockin' other socks
'Cause now in the hood he's 'Johnny The Fox'

Till one ring came, Jody blew a spark
Found about Jody round the corner in the park
Flipping like a dipstick, hip to the news
Practicing the range, bellowing the blues

Jack rolls the carpet in, swift like a skate
Yo, Jody, yo, gotta go, got a date
Padlock Jody's screaming, "Wait, wait, wait"
"Don't worry, hon," he replies, "I'm keepin' the faith"

I'll never do the baseball with you again
Yo, I'll never do the baseball with you
'Cause your hoochie-coo was so smooth
Was it such a sin to let, let me in?

Hooked by your ever-so-shyness
Want that bush, heard you're from Flatbush
Ran after ya, caught ya
Brought ya to Long Island, stylin' for a while

In my hut, I was on a cut for a peck, a silly Greg Peck
You tried to play me new, Plug One you disconnect
I'd try to touch your hair, you would say no
Yo, I'd try to touch your hair, you would say no

Is it 'cause you want my financial flaunt?
First you gotta please me, nice and easy
But I guess you want that in reverse
So I stand Plug First can see

We got a serious block
Turn the other way, ooh, what do I spot?
A hoopin' Hey Love whose scent left a trace
Had a stash in her pocket with a body that's safe

Ball to the eight, now you wanna swing?
Forget the rap, yo, Black Sheep, sing

You're banned, you're banned
You're banned, honey dip, you're banned
You're banned, you're banned

Ya banned by the preacher man
You played yourself a stew
Now to me you step, never mind love
The faith is being kept

Now remember 'bout Padlock Jody, here's the fact
Jack little wick but she was acting wack
Jack wanna lay but laying ain't exact
For the past four or five she was banned by the pack

Hip to the witness, putting on a plan
No money, no more Puddy Tat for the man
Jack knows that honey means playing a game
Only wanna bowl, got nabbed for the fame, goddamn

Sam was the man that you planned to command
Nothing new about a neighborhood
You know what? Padlock Jody wanna cut
Jack's thinking cap, make mine into a pack

Yo, here's twenty, forty, sixty, pay me back
Conscience appears, "Yo Jack, what you doing?"
You play the cold while honey here's cooling?
You don't have to if you don't want to
You don't have to if you don't want to"

So he begins with the ring, ring, ring
"Hey, Judy girl, how ya doin'
Seen you with another man, what you doing, screwing?
Ooh, shame on you, what, you can't wait
For the big bait, well, I'm ma tell you straight
Honey child, I'm keepin' the faith"

In no way are we trying to disrespect
Any sort of house or club music
But we're just glad that we're not doing it
And if we were, this is how it would go

Kicked out the house, you got
Kicked out the house, hip house
Kicked out the house for good

Kicked out the house, you got
Kicked out the house, hip house
Kicked out the house for good

With your wrinkled pussy
I can't be your lover
With your wrinkled oh, oh, oh
I can't be your lover

With your wrinkled pussy
I can't be your lover
With your wrinkled oh, oh, oh
I can't be your lover

Put it on vibrate
Put it on vibrate
Put it on vibrate
Put it on vibrate
Put it on vibrate

Kicked out the house, you got
Kicked out the house, hip house
Kicked out the house for good

You got, you got
Kicked out of this house
Baby for good

I can't, I can't, I can't be your lover
Put it on vibrate
Put it on vibrate

I got good news, I got eye witness
Good news, I got eye witness
Due in a hip lift, dead into my phenomenon
Dazed with the quickness
Sweat, one sweat, two sweat, three
Motions, what motions? What could it be?
She, she  who, me?
Hon, Velveeta got your cut

Give the symmetrics to your bottom

Shake less of that Catholic cool
Push panic, the button, and freeze
A's for Amen, J's for the Jenifa
Oh Jennys, oh please oh please

Let, let me in, let, let me in

Force it like a motion, let me in to that
Flower power child, let me in to that
Let me sew your panic button, let me in to that
I got the semen headlocked, you won't get fat
Just lay, lay back, way, way, way
The oops up, it's a clear Saturday
We're selling my all-expense July paid
By the way, what's your name?
Just kidding, I know it's Renee
No, it isn't? Word, word, well check it out
Check, check it out
I got my my mind made up, come on, get it
Take a test, child
And get with this Pos position
From beginning to the Huckleberry Fin
If I was to yodel, would you let me in?

Let, let me in, let, let me in

Pos got the skyrocket in his jeans
Would you let me in if I was to sing
Like a hookey-non-stop-reggae-roost-rasta-king
Jimmy done starburst, know what I mean
Jimmy done burst, gotta come clean
Yo, Maseo, blow this scene

Dip, dip, di, you're making me cry
With that onion between your thighs
Come give me some of that brown sugar
So the sweets can make me active
If I said you were attractive
May I supplement with an additive?
Hey, hooker let me hook you with my reel
Take you to the crib, cook up a real meal
Skip the meal and walk this way

Come on into my room, here we go
Here we here we here we go
 Did you feel the bed break?
 Did you feel the floor shake?
 Did you feel the earth quake?
 Now, quick, do you wanna take a break?

Let, let me in, let, let me in

(So he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed
And at last he blew the house in)

It's strong island for real, where the critters run wild
The prefix is 516, the top of the dial
Through the L.I. Sound, to the villa down under
And across the globe I heard a lot of folks wonderin'
So when's it coming cause the stakes is high see big money that waves
Don't put the pen to my page
And ain't nothin' wrong with standing still and relaxing
And spendin' some of that cash that Uncle Sam is gonna tax
A New York demeanor, sit back in the beamer
With nothing to lose but some gas and some minutes
Ignorin' the gazers cause some stars don't get petty
And that trash you talk is just New Years confetti
It's like that y'all, but that's all 'bout to change
Like some of my own, people tend to act strange
I'm making a scene, and it's served with it's capabilities
So set it at an island's degrees

It's strong island for real, the diagnosis is supreme
The prefix is 516, where microphones fiend
The voices that gots the gift, cause the world is on their shoulders
Makein' plans to switch from little rock to money boulders
The real proceed
My girl stands deep from nubians actin' like Columbians sellin' keys
Characters have the tendency to con themselves
To think the East Coast is only New York and Philadelph
You know the way we blow, your shit is played like pork
And as for what we be bringin' you, we live and direct from New York
I ougtta say my fam calls me Merce
Steppin' to me fool will get you punched out like a curse
It's like that y'all, let it all consume
Like them brothas who smoke, 'till they high like the moon
Soon to a town near you be them super emcees
Settin' them Long Island degrees

I hit the L.I.R.R. for big dreamers out east
And get your bank roll split
Bangin' dents out your systems
Sellin' points to get the uppercut like Sonny Liston
But eyes closed episodes
Bring you back to zeroes
The same herp playin' like he Casablanca
Blind to it, but I'm a grind him up a cup of Sanka
Servin' dimes loves on tennis courts and sorts
Laid back like grown folks sippin' tea for sport

I be sweepin' up the room with my lyrical broom
While others rhymes smell like plastic like some lunch room utensil
The official color for this planet is green
Which growns in pockets of them people willing to scheme
An't no expose, these facts are from the mouth
Profilin' through Island with that wind from down south
At last, be the world broad cast from the crew who gave you 3's
Magic on an island degrees

It's strong island for real where the critters smoke fritters
Night time excites time for the heavy hitters
Gang on hers cause in the mean time mine is home on date
Fluffin' pillows impatiently waitin' ain't no debatin'
'Bout to settle, check the level stakes is high as the sky
I got questions about your life if you so ready to die
We in the last quarter y'all, somebody's gonna cry
I think they need to set the clock before the time pass by

In the round one no nines my size can get swelly
Sensing danger I will play a ranger on my celly with my felly
We're wonderful like colorful flix
Provide a thread and needle every time the stages get ripped
I grip upon the pleasure sippin' the tea
On the island cause that island is the main artery
So uh, you better come and give respect for catch some of these
Knucks from the island degrees

Get into groove now, something like
Givin' into my own shit, now

Could a drummer have some why'all
Could a drummer have some more
Said a drummer ain't have none
In a long time
Come on, drummer

Bring that beat back, bring that beat back 
Y'all want to hear that beat, right?
1,2 1,2

Uh
Suttarakankan kankankankan Takagi Kan
Beat ni noseta kashi kore ichiban
So toshi gin-yu shijin groove
Meguri megutte konomachi de furu
TOYOTA ni HONDA nippon mo iroiro

featuring De La Soul 
Possy Dovey!  Time to get up! 

Hello  I'm Queen Latifah  how ya doing? 
I hope that you're with this  I hope that you're willing 
I want to introduce you to a cut called 
"Mama Gave Birth to the Soul Children" 

Well here comes the goy 
The truth to the goy 
You know the one  that ate up like boy 
Stepping with a step, keeping with a kept 
Making an appearance with a notty-head set 
Lunatics you lose cause the Plug 2's singing 
Peace to the negative, nah, you make the weigh-in 
Weigh-in, weigh-in, way out of order 
If you know you're better, you'd better that you caught a 
Waving mine a peace sign higher than a kite 
If you're feeling sick, it's alright it's fever night 
Don't do "Do see do" and dig in no potholes 
Cause if you do we calling in March Patrol 
It's no different from the verbal last heard 
Cayumbo is the ruler that's bond to the word 
He's moving more than three feet, jocking with the knee deep 
Dove is going to leave you with a tweet tweet tweet 

Next on the menu, we continue with the pasta 
Dipped in chocolate, served with lots a 
Twizzlers and honey, yum yum yummy 
Lyrics I'm flaunting is good for the tummy 
Tiptoeing in I proceed to the floors 
Selling much records like a pimp mover 
Excuse me mommy, Pos wins 
Cause I'm the A to the Plug W-O-N 
Brother freak it live for this tribe 
Now let's ride down the highway of vibes 
Pushing that we start cause the soul says please 
Cutting back with the raps and we don't get cheese 
Ducks and we sit need to get 
Cause preacher is the key to the casualty 
Polaroid flicks are back and you know 
That the soul is moving on up like the Jeffersons 

Go mommy! 

I'm back, a black queen upon the scene 
With a knack for funky tracks, know what I mean? 
Prince Paul produces this and it's a fly one 
It has a beat that weigh, he's one of my sons 
It's a family affair and then we're out of here 
There is no doubt here, cause this is our year 
So flex to a Queen Latifah/De La Soul sound 
 
It's inevitable that this joint venture would be incredible 
We never put ourselves on any pedestal 
But the rhyme is so good it's practically edible  
So check the sounds of Mama Zulu 
As I relay the story untold 
And if you're wondering why I got kids so big 
They weren't born from the body, they were born from the soul

Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror what is wrong?
Can it be my De La Clothes
Or is it just my De La Soul
What I do ain't make believe
People say I sit and try
But when it comes to being De La
It's just 
me myself and I

It's just me myself and I 

Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No we're not, thats pure Plug Bull
Always pushin that we formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I 

Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
himself, not what you read or write
Write is wrong when hype is written
on the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of show-biz
De La Soul is from the soul
And in fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

It's just me myself and I 

Glory Glory Hallelu
Glory for Plug One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By concensing dookie eyes
People think they dis my person
by stating I'm darkly packed
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
and he states, "Black is Black"
Mirror mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Just keep all nuts twistin up
so I don't get an aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
in the 4th day of July
Cause they tried to mess with third degree
That's me myself and I

It's just me myself and I 

Mirror, mirror on the wall 
Tell me, mirror, what is wrong? 
Can it be my De La clothes 
Or is it just my De La song? 
What I do ain't make-believe 
People say I sit and try 
But when it comes to being De La 
It's just me myself and I 

It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 

Now you tease my Plug One style 
And my Plug One spectacles 
You say Plug One and Two are hippies 
No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull 
Always pushing that we've formed an image 
There's no need to lie 
When it comes to being Plug One 
It's just me myself and I 

It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 

Proud, I'm proud of what I am 
Poems I speak are Plug Two type 
Please oh please let Plug Two be 
Himself, not what you read or write 
Right is wrong when hype is written 
On the Soul, De La that is, 
Style is surely our own thing 
Not the false disguise of showbiz 
De La Soul is from the soul 
And this fact I can't deny 
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie 
And from me myself and I 

It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 

Glory, glory hallelujah
Glory for Plugs One and Two 
But that glory's been denied 
By kizids and dookie eyes 
People think they dis my person 
By stating I'm darkly pack 
I know this so I point at Q-Tip 
And he states, 'Black is Black' 
Mirror mirror on the wall, 
Shovel chestnuts in my path 
Please keep on up with the nuts 
So I don't get in aftermath 
But if I do I'll calmly punch them 
In the fourth day of July 
'Cause they tried to mess with 
Third degree, that's me myself and I 

It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I 
It's just me myself and I

This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly
But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie
Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly
Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly
Around this time the slammin' joint was 'Milk is Chillin''
But even cooler was my social worker Dillon
Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles
Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles
He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races
That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces
She had the curves that made you wanna take chances
I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances
I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'
I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing
At the time no one knew but it was a shame
That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game

Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'
On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'
You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'
Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'
Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you
He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you?
You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool
Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school
He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey
He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's
Child, ya got the best of pops anyone could have
Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad

Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon
But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain
While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom
And he would toss and then would force her to give him head room
Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen
But when she'd fuss, he would just commence to slappin'
(Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's
The deal?)
I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal
Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him
And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em
And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'
How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him
When I got home, I found she had tried to call me
My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' 
I tried to call the honey but her line was busy
I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon

I received a call from Misses Sick herself
I asked her how was she recoverin' her health
She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute
She wanted to talk serious, I said, "go ahead-shoot"
She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile
Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol
That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one
She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one
Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates
Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits
There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip
He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip
You're just mad he's your overseer at school
No need to play him out like he's someone cruel
She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else
Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self

Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses
And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes
Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother
He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother
As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie
I ask her what's her problem, all she says is "Where is he?"
I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'
She shouts to Dill, 'He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!'
None of the kids could understand what was the cause
All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus
Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to
Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to
Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over

Pos: 

Yo  yo  excuse me 

I heard the word from word of mouth 

That you were into booking flights 

My  travel agent took a trip up north 

And I need to book a flight tonight 

I  enjoyed a getting away from day  

To day stress so I need to leave 

Soon. (If that's a case, I have no space 

But for later I'd be sore to ) 

Nah, nah, that's not gonna do, I know that you 

Can find another flight leavin the same 

Time. I need to get aboard. I can't afford 

Any penalties to sit in the main cabin 

 It doesn't matter (What does? The money. 

Show the cash and the ticket is yours) 

Cool. Here's your green. Now I'm up outta the scene 

But I'll be back to purchase some more 

Jewels. 

Chorus: 

 More than you know it 

 More than you know it 

 I want some mo'! 

 I want some mo'! 

  

  

Pos: 

Now I'm comin down outta the clouds 

And I'm runnin into turbulence 

Need to get up, up higher again 

Feelin like my soul's on fire again 

Don't need to bail for safety, show me where the safe be 

So I can take me another trip 

To the agency, cause the travel unravel my woes 

But now the craving grows 

So, I need to get a ticket cause man, oh I, 

Need to get aboard a plane again 

Some, say I'll crash, but It's my life and cash 

Gonna write it out until the end 

Numb, to the lift of the whiff, , when I vacate frequently 

And I got, frequent flyer when I retire to death 

Tell 'em that the big see sent me 

And a lot, of brothers man. I'm not the only brother 

At the airport, needin a lift 

Off. Was a agent til I was caught and brought 

To an unfair court, pleadin the fifth 

Soft, ground I prefer upon the mound 

When I pinched a rock for a fee 

Now others say standin at the bat isn't where it's at 

But takin hits is where I'd rather be 

Chorus 

Dove: 

Now I bagged this chick but she got me wide 

Made me lose my friends and my pride 

Had me cashing my checks for her 

Lost all my self-respect for her 

When I was broke she'd go solicit other guys 

And if we made love you could see it in my eyes 

My fantasy was one day to be a millionaire 

So I could reassure that my baby girl was there 

I could feel her love, son, I taste it in her lips 

Mentally she was a trip, had a nigga whipped 

A lot of other cats got strung out in the past 

But I'ma get the love last, then I make a dash 

That's what I thought but Miss Thing was too appealing 

When I had no dough for her, she had a nigga stealing 

 Now I'm incarcerated, honey ain't around 

Into withdrawal from her, while I'm locked down 

Two years down I hear she's still a thick dime 

Controllin niggas pockets and even ladies' minds 

 ? with a temptin proposition 

 But when she said "Hi" I had to listen 

I'm sweatin beans cause I know I'm gonna bait her 

Better do it now cause you're bound to do it later 

I can't refuse her, my denial's a wish 

Fell into her arm when I gave her a kiss 

Cause I like it 

Chorus

"And what we have is much more than they can see"

No doubt, y'all care anymore, about this hip-hop man?
I mean, how far will you punk motherfuckers go
For 15 seconds of fame?  
Microwave popcorn-ass niggaz
Yeah, we give you much more, longevity baby
Aiyyo Dave

Yo!  It's been instilled in me since infinite y'all
Usin' these minutes like I value the call
Put your money in the bank, and hold rank
Over friends who ain't got leadership skills

I got the sheep in my eyes so I can't sleep
We like the, land and laid, the brand old way
Grand operate the scandal way, L.I. sheist
I play the Xbox instead of fuckin' with dice
I hate losin' to those who walk away with my dough
'Cause I dozed, Tracy broke me
And now she want to see the resident provokin' me
To pop wheelies on my bicycle, watch her eyes twinkle

One house, two houses, third house
House rules so house take bank, watch Dave bank
Banner had 'em on the hawk since Atlanta extravaganza
Gamma ray rap I make the Hulk snap
Jump back like James Brown, hey now
When the liquor over we smokin' the hay now
Delegatin' numero dos, I holla out the sound of los
And keep the Island close to me

Much more is what we got in store
Just believe me
Much more than they can see
Is how it'll always be, believe me 

I got verb skills, babies and bills, brothers who smoke krills
And still tryin' to get himself together from it
Knowin' he can't quite run it like me
I'm on the cutting edge of what's alleged to be, hot
And when you rock, it's just impersonations of me
The rightest MC, MP with the V in the middle

I belittle your plan, courtesy, of NY dirty see my man
My base of fans are made up of many; with kids allergic
To belts lettin' they mind melt from drinkin' the Henny
And them straight and narrow types who be waitin' to hear
Them drums say the revolution is near - are you listening?
Are your eardrums open for christening?

We got God Body MC's with these tools
While some others play God, they just God damn fools with it
I don't cuff mics, I rough mics up rough and rugged
Get the girls to love it
Still and all five-oh came to my mic check
Tellin' me I left lacerations around my mic's neck
Domestically disputed and you just might get
The undisputed underdog servin' y'all threat

"And what we have is much more than they can see"

No doubt, y'all care anymore, about this hip-hop man?
I mean, how far will you punk motherfuckers go
For 15 seconds of fame?

Brother, brother oh brother of mine
We used to be down as partners in crime
From our parents our name was forged
I was the Beaver, you Curious George
Wanted to dispose of this and that
But curiosity had killed the cat
At this age no wonder it was read
But this was the fate that you were fed
Throughout high school our minds we'd waste
High off all the cheeba that we could taste
Soon you had converted to nasal sports
Every five minutes cocaine you'd snort
Told me that you needed a stronger fix
Stepped to the crack scene in '86
Unlike the other drugs where you had control
This substance had engulfed your body and soul
Now from me you lost all respect
Said yo need to put that shit in check
Wanted me to believe that you had tried
But your mind and the craving had coincided
Said there was a voice inside you that talked
Which said you shouldn't stop but continue to walk
Now the brother who could handle any drug
Had just found the one that could pull his Plug

"Yo, bro, got another rock for your hiking boots"
"Gonna make you scream and loop three loops"
"Gonna take you far on a freeway, okay"
Remember that day? Slipped me a smile for a 20 crack vial
Guess what? Time to collect, correct
Don't have a dime? It's payback time, payback time
"Don't cry the blues cause I got bad news"
"Should I stab ya? Should I bite ya? Should I use my tools?"
No, I got another way to earn my defeat, ah!

Brother, brother, stupid brother of mine
Started getting high at the age of nine
Now at twenty-one you're lower than low
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to go
My dividends and wares started to disappear
Where it ended up, I had an idea
Barking you with the quickness, reversed intent
Instead went to Pop and gave him the print
Now Pop grew tired of being a mouse
Finally told you to get the hell outta the house
From there a mother figure came into play
Claimed for you she saw a better day
Now Mom was a product of Christ's rebirth
Thought the only chance was to go to church
Quitting this stuff you had tried before
This time you claimed you'd really score
Something I had to see to believe
Put on my suit and to church I weaved

My, my, my. What happened to the people? The people who used to care
About what took place in the world today? I've been summoned here
Today to reach the people who still can be reached, to save the people
Who still can be saved. Can I get an Amen? Can I get an Amen?
Hit me! Forgive us. Said it's taking over. Taking over the world. All
It's doing is taking over. Where them crackers at? Them crackers that
They serve, where they at?

Bullshit, didn't believe a lick
To this fool fell off, well that would stick
Then again you benefited the doubt
Wanted to see if you would work it out
Soon you reach your front of calm
Walked round by rehearsing psalms
Then you smiled with the funky frown
What do you know, the voice is back in town
Mom would say it would soon go away
You and I knew it was here to stay
But the man helped you when you helped yourself
That meant going to rehab for your health
Finally it went and blew your cork
Heard you moved to the comfortable streets of New York
And when my friends see me and come and ask
"Yo, where's your brother at?"
I'll be the first to splash
"Yo, he's a basehead"

Yo, who hold guns and rock ice bigger than life
Got bitches throwing they drawers on stage, that ain't me!
I raise kids, push whips, piss an MC
Love money like I love my moms
Love my nigga Com Sense when he bang dents all up in they wallets
Wall to wall bullshit I got hardwood floors
Set sail for tour ever since eighty-nine
So why y'all are fucking the same hoes who used to be mine

And I've been waiting three summers to rhyme longside my people
Rico, De La, inject you with the lethal
Dose of hop-hipping if you thought CaTash was slipping
Then put that drink down, you drunk off what you sipping
CaTash put the dip in dip dive socialize
Fuck around with me and next you'll find yo' crib burglarized

Yo you better recognize and try to analyze this
Hand over fist, how can a man act like a bitch?
Change and switch, snitch on his crew
Yo get rid of the niggas before the same thing happen to you

And they'll leave your ass sticky like glue
Blood leaking out, girls freaking out, motherfucking cops tweaking out
Got you on your knees like a freak, juggling deez nuts
Smuggling these cuts from S.C., you best be-
Lieve there's no web or leave a net
We done swallowed 40 bottles of threat, yo

What you know about my writes? 
What you know about what's weak, what's tight?
And what you know about an off night? 
What you know about niggas fronting for the light?
And what you know about them gun fights? 
Got a nigga ducking while them girls show fright
What you know about my writes? 
Ah what you know about my writes? 

Yeah, yeah, look
I'm Samson without Delilah, the soul survivor
The drunk driver that rolls straight, take the whole cake
Chop it up with the family, wash it down with alcohol
My telly's a Desert Eagle for all the fucking shots I called
My niggas gotta ball, never settle for less
Heavy metal, heavy on yo' chest like two breasts
Step into my office cause it's time for you to roll something
One false move, and we gon' beat you like you stole something

Yo these style I kick should be called ? rap
Drawing the pussy out the nigga after my prize, cause I want it
They stomach what I throw, they know I'm right for they diet
They librarian flow keeps the party real quiet 
The love I lost outweighs the rhymes I gain
But the fact that I spit 'em makes me cherish the name
So pass the mic so I can put in my share
I rip it from home to L.A.
With connecting flights to rip it elsewhere

Drinking up Black and Tan in the back of a van

I learned as a young man, long trip, piss in a can
Getting a house for two grand, now you got your own land
Let your mind expand, everyday have a plan
Ro-Gram is rare earth, swingin Black Tarzan
You got to live with the cards dealt in yo' hand
Stay young like Peter Pan, like Sly, take a Stand
And go Uptown Saturday Night like Ichiban

I keep it dirty like under the bed 
Dirty like Uncle Red, hey yo
Dirty brown Likwit flow thicker than the Yoo-Hoo
Dirt you dishing out, chef telling it all
Face down in the dirt, doing my dirty work
Expert, trying to regulate my network
Head jerk, spice it with rice, stick with it
If they ask who cut the grits I'ma say E-Swift did it

And I've been known to get it on, past the break of the dawn
Tash'll punch you in your grill and leave 'Potholes in Yo' Lawn'
 You making diss songs? Spit that rhyme my way
I can shut why y'all niggas down like the why-2-K
I did a tour in ninety-four with De La Soul and Tribe
We on the same vibe, cause real niggas coincide
 The situation is drastic
But see songs like these is why this album going classic

This is for the DJ, bring it back one time
I drop bombs like when my moms told me to rhyme
I'm, old school like my dad is
So add this, to your collect', Plug Won, who the baddest?

Hey yo, we theme park status, upstage these niggas like Gladys
Them little Pips, they done tripped the wire
Blaming they legs, while I'm claiming these tunes
In this we'll stay down like seats found in sorority bathrooms

Yeah, we flat out classic, separate the real from the plastic
And I gotta say no names
Play no games, hit the switches, crack the frame
Show no shame or fuck it all up, take the blame
Brand name fresh out the box type hustle
Manpower success is mind over muscle
Grind til the wheels fall off, accept the loss
I never been soft, whatever the cost, addicted to floss
Nailed to the cross it's time to return
My only concern is making sure that Hollywood burn,
Hollywood burn, burn to the ground, trick-ass niggas
Is all up in the game and don't deserve to be down

Four bottle rap, twist the cap and kick back
De La, Xzibit and Tha Liks came to get that
And what you know about us dropping ya
And leaving you with half a face like the Phantom of the Opera?

Ah what you know about my writes? 
Ah what you know about my writes? 

You got the right to shut the fuck up!

I never can say goodbye
No no n-no I, never can say goodbye
I, I don't know the rest

We those pros, we never procrastinate 
Them guardians they shouldn't let you get past the gate
Watch out dog, the watchdog's showing his teeth
 they biting your beat
While I speak from experience, hunger and hurt
And a little bit of hate from niggas doing me dirt
I just wash it all out with Tide and show love
to those who ride with me while I'm putting in work

Full-timing it, 8:30 to 6, the graveyard shift
The three months before the benefits hit
But my position went temp' to perm'
I sat and listened like an intern watching who applied get fired
Now I'm sitting in the break room, they gotta make room 
My paper stacks, put staples through 'em
So I can keep my money together
Some die-hard fans just don't want it like, "Put Pos back on it"

I'm back on it, that's why you never disappointed
We give you what we live through for real 
Don't own a crown but I'm royalty
And trying to see the royalty checks about a half a mil'
Whether off or on the chart, my cuts grips your heart
 like your gut splits apart
I never pass the buck, my shoulder holds the weights
So don't beef when we don't pass collection plates

I don't give money, I don't support the needy
Schooled in America, taught to be greedy
And everything ought to be, easy
But I never could say goodbye to my friends who get high
I wonder why, I'm rocking with that guy, it's serious
Still make him cry when the satire's hilarious
Cold for your areas, flows come in various shapes and sizes
so hot that you despise it

Never last up to bat 
These skills we don't lack 
We never fall and pray 
Make all the ladies say 
You can't knock the hustle not at all 
Can't be budged by your muscle 
Never riding on E 
It's De La and Butta V 

Yo, if you are what you eat; some of you
cats heads between your girl's legs a lot cause y'all act too sweet
 Then after that
Put in a little more practice on your rhyming attack
What you write's not the least bit hot
Maybe cause your wrist is so cold from all that ice you cop
Hate to hate a player but you know what?
I still smother ya like cheese and rocking leaves freshly cut

And we the steak and potatoes and De La's the greatest
And ladies be on the floor thanking the Lord that He made us
I'm telling you, I swoop her like a pelican do
You saying look at that pelican fly, you spitting gelatin rhymes
They shaky as shit, ugly in the mold you fit
We the square peg on the round hole, sound's soulful
Your imitation flavor is tofu
It's true we make our bed all day, and we are

the world of rap! Take you back
in the days of all four hundred ways that people lack
It's that  authentic, big-nosed mic music 
Four to five survive all night to it
I'm trying to keep up with my Jones' and Thomas'
'til I'm broke like them New Year's Eve promises
And that's alright, I just penned another sixteen
to fill my bank account with the mixed greens

Moms want 5's and 10's
The girls I got is 9's and 10's, VH1 "Behind The Pens"
You anticipate greatness from elder statesmen
I ch-ch-ch-ah, like Biz Mark' or Jason
I bust one shot just to start the racing
The tortoise and the hare, which one there is chasing?
Slow and steady, we already Andretti
Get ticket take parades, waves and confetti and

Never last up to bat 
These skills we don't lack 
We never fall and pray 
Make all the ladies say 
You can't knock the hustle 
Can't be budged by your muscle 
Never riding on E 
It's De La and Butta V 

 
Come on y'all

If the Soul keeps rocking, the streets will keep rocking
If the streets keep rocking, the Soul will keep rocking
If the streets stop rocking, the Soul will keep rocking
If the Soul keeps rocking, the streets will keep rocking

Oodles and oodles of O's, you know
You get 'em from my sister
You get 'em from my bro
All I is is man, and once an embryo
Am I solid gold? I don't cast a glow

Yes, I guess it's reflex some have no control
I'd rather let a laughter and tally, off I go
Canoeing up the river or out into the O
You just know me not so not play the role
Some are lovey-Dovey, ah you crazies know
Some shake your hand but 
I was John Doe, now I'm Mr. Jolicoeur
Pissed with the witness, and now I adore
O's got the world cause O's was on tour
Girls gave the O's, and guys, oh for sure
Were they arose, well nobody knows
What do they mean, well here's how it goes
Oh shoot's got the O's when you hold the dough
You know who you are but they didn't know
And now with respect they flex like a pro
You're first another nigga but now an Afro

Oodles and oodles of O's and
Oodles and oodles and oodles of O's you know
Oodles and oodles of O's and
Oodles and oodles and oodles of O's you know
Oodles and oodles of O's and
Oodles and oodles and oodles of O's you know

Last of the fast Plug pipers at the door
In your eye burning like rubbing alcohol
Native is the Tongue that speaks the Guacomo
Kinfolk will play this in stere-ere-o
Chanters play the part of a herd at a show
Pos prints the peace on his jeans or Girbauds
But let the herd know if beef they wanna throw
Lunches of punches is what I bestow
Oodles of O's it has my hoes in mic checks
O's take the shape of medallions and specs
Don't forget the O's that let the air in my nose
Breathe in the fresh as the stale hit the road
Girls ask for flicks and I'll block the pores
Eat the Al Greens, won't sniff the Kurt Blows
Mase got something to say and it goes

Now I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's you know
I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's
Now I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's you know
I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's
Now I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's you know
I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's
Now I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's you know
I think we're talking 'bout the oodles of O's

Hoods like to play macho, you know
Guns going "Bo!", people hit the floor
Don't have a piece but an arrow and bow
Target it firm cause I'm head Comancho
Charging barricades like a raging rhino
The donuts come big and some in jumbo
The landlord is finished but before I go
I'll give a shout out to Quest and my fellow Jungle Bros

Knocked by the dock of the bay by the shore
Swimming in the rhythm of the hi-de-hi-de-ho
Punk Pinocchios gotta go, gotta go
 to be cheerful
Season is breeze, time to pimp promote
Nuts can no flow if the shade is in the dough
On with me hat, d-d-duh-duh-doh
Dreadlock is heading out the door y'all

We're selling O's, y'all
We're selling O's and O's
We're selling O's at the corner store y'all
We're selling O's, y'all
We're selling oodles and oodles and oodles
And oodles of O's, y'all

Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get your ass up, and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we more than rough, we callin' your bluff
And when it comes to rhymes
Yo, don't scandalize mine
I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Never fetchin' for crime, halt! Who goes there?

Yo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear
Shinin' black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare

While we rockin' it, I'll rock in it 
Like the little ball inside the spray can
Providing three coats for both child, woman and man

God bless the God, lay these Streets Wall to Wall
It go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry click
It went, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

It ain't my fault your ass is on the asphalt
Got your chin touched by my fam' who though you brought harm, you see
I'm iced out like a glass of tea
Better yet, oatmeal cookies, y'all just rookies to me
Slidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D
Why try? Maseo be gettin' high since Luke was Luke Skywalk'
Man, my topic of talk is sheddin' shame all over your game
Like them shorties who claim that afrocentric lovin' is the past drug
A life filled with that's what thugs love
Snatch you fast, wrap that ass in the rug of your choice
while it muffles your voice

Now when I'm swimmin' through the joint, I put the funk on hold
Cause if you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss

Most crews are post-current while we're forever
Direct beats that's contagious, loved by all ages
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity
of hard-hitters, for real

I got niggas in the streets that'll blast your ass for the shine
And get, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, if you a fat chick gettin' your fuck on tonight
Then go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, put your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin' our sound
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, and to my broke niggas on the corner holdin' me down
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

Yo, I swear Tommy gonna get it, he done did me wrong
I had plans to buy more land, plant corn
Bust kernels on heat, work hard like wetbacks
Set backs is gonna get my ass to be hostile
Rockwilder the beat, top dollar defeat
Big money's make the big decisions
Keep hip-hop alive, it's just an intermission 
Back to the second half of the feature flick
Dick stacks and fuck rap

I had a name for makin' paper since paper mache
Now my dollar coins join pounds of yen for play
While you broke niggas reach drunk much quicker
You don't make enough bread to soak up all your liquor
Went from God to God damn

Damn God, you're killin' it
Should incorporate it, invest half a mil' in it
Rap cats talk with no will in it

Soundin' like they virtual
This joint'll hurt you, yo

Twas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed
 They did a job
Took all my goodies out from under the tree, except the CD's
of shiny-suit rappers and flossin' emcees
who fail at takin' it to rhyme degrees

Man, you know no wack poems get no play in our homes
You need to not get nappy with me
Or else we gon' "relax your mind, let your conscious be free"

Yo, where my Wall Street niggas, if ya up in the stands
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
To my women that'll throw they hands against they punk-ass man
Go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, if you never been shot or stabbed
Brick City go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Yo, I gotta catch a cab back to the lab so I can smoke
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get your ass up, and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we more than rough, we callin' your bluff

First P is passed
I am known as
Posdnuos, Plug One to the whole race
Rhyme on a tour
Smart and much more
Dispatch I've stood themes with the Mad Face
Tall dark and lean
Was once nineteen
Now I'm one year older with reason
Clean thoughts and drawers
Rhyme flow never stalls
The yes yes yes y'alls
Will end this season
The Soul reached high plains
We didn't reach Soul Train
But Don don't like rap
So that won't happen
Fame we don't lust
God we do trust
Arsenio dissed us
But the crowd kept clapping
Blessed with soul's lights
So turn off your brights
Overexposure will bring about a clear soul
Don't push, but piles
For this here new style
And excuse me y'all while I fill my potholes

Pass the peas like they used to say

Passed off second
Tru I reckon
Head full of dreds
But knowledge inside
Singin' on records, making it hectic
Wishing it all would fall and die
Radio works it, public consumes it
Tommy Boy wants another "Say No," huh
Rough and rugged
It's not a new twist
Been Trugoy since the first get go
Here's the daisy
Watching it die, see?
Native is the new like Balance is the shoe
Paul makes a mil like dill makes pickles
Plus is to add like addin to the crew is
Pimps promote us, RM's work us
MP's watch us close in focus
Watch me steppin'
Now I'm dancing
Then disappear with a hocus pocus

Pass the peas like they used to say

Fourth P is passed
I am known as

Yeah thanks Mase
Applied like chapsticks
The songs are slapsticks
Skeezoids with polaroids
Give me such a case
Trife or not trife
Don't own a wife
Yet I'm down and around for a good kiss
I got a 40 of Pepsi
A girl in Bed-Stuy
And I'll end it like this!

Yo what up? It's Paul, got ten minutes each
I'm here to get this piece to redo it or there's one we left for you
Whatever you, whatever you said, I agree
That's why I was to get tore up on I am I be, that rhymed

Umm, quest Que see? Yo, man they dissed me in the
Source man they gave me no credit for my songs
For the Slick Rick stuff gave credit for songs I did
That's a diss, I'm mad man, I hate, and I hate

And you can quote me and you can record this
And put this on a record I hate them, I hate them
And I'm ma get them, if it's the last thing I do
Anyway, hope you have a pleasant day, peace

My name, my name, my name is the Pasta
Now I like, I like I like to plug the real thing
So loose, so loose, so loose with the tap dance
The funk, the funk, funky funky stuff I bring
My tribe, my tribe, my tribe is known as Native Tongues
Consists, consists, consists of Jungle, Quest and others
Get played, get played, played a lot on radio
And also, and also, and also by some foul brothers
The Pease, the Pease the Pease Porridge never failed
It kept, it kept us calm, our stylin' merry
But late, but lately loonies acting real bold
Can't sip in luxury my apple cranberry
Girls watch, and watch, and watch I dance the big tut
Our home, our home our homeboys has to plan tricks
Don't real, don't real, don't realise the Native Tongue
Is rollin' strong and we're startin' in the megamix

Question, and that's if only I can ask this question
Can I? 
Why do people think just because we speak peace
We can't blow no joints?

Mase, this is the ninth day I've reheated this porridge. You know it
Keeps me peacefully, no?

Yeah, but my tolerance level has now peaked
And now it's time for some heads to get flown

We bring, we bring, we bring, we bring the peace of course
But pack a nine inside, inside my De La drawers
A picture, picture, picture, picture painted pink
Could turn to red, to red, to red in blooded quick
But in a single file my Native Tongue is calm
I'd rather, rather pass a brother a pound or palm
I kick, I kick, I kick a verse of unity
And shack, and shackle steps to the beat, beat
I click, I click the TV to the Simpsons
And sip the Porridge deep into my system
So mel, so mellow mode is my day mode
Inside the studio or on a road
The Shwing, the Shwingalo is the now step
It's murder if you bet cause you're life's jep
To praise, to praise the Soul is on a down drag
It's false, because I'll spray you with the Black Flag

Can't stand, can't stand, can't stand the pop music
Brother, brother, brothers pop a lot of pow
Don't watch, don't watch, don't watch a lot of basketball
Don't und, don't understand the act of being foul
Hey D, hey D, hey DJ set the record up
It's time, it's time, it's time to tame the naughty pups
Throw on the Touching Fingers serenade
So we can throw our lemonade
In their face and kick their little butts

People wanna get ragged with the reruns
Me not, me not, me not scared to trudge a bit
They can't, they can't, they can't get close to none
I tap, I tap, I tap a dance war skit
The por, the por, the Porridge got crazy cold
We won't, we won't eat until the heads are flown
Take advantage to a cool one's peaceful ways
But when, but when we fly that head all the people say

Here in Frogland, we always eat our Porridge, cause it keeps us frogs
Real peaceful like

In my land, my people adore Porridge. And I don't understand why De La
Soul is so violent
And we are so peaceful, we sit by the camp fire and listen to our rituals, and
They are so violent. I don't understand
I don't understand

Uh uh uh
Everywhere I go 
People ask me 
Yo dealer, you smoke weed 
And I just tell em' Yeah!
Two weeks later, they smokin' weed
That's what I'm talkin' about
I ain't here to tell you not to smoke weed
Everybody get high
I'm here to apply the pressure
You, you, you and you
You and you 
Come down to the den
I got some shit that'll blow ya mind

Come here my peer, let me apply the pressure, the pressure
Come here my peer, let me apply the pressure, the pressure

Yo, what up my nigga 
Ain't shit, just got off the cell with this girl 
Yeah be	 you know what we about to do 
Come on nigga puff it too, yeah right

Honey draws bees like dookie draws flies
Just like the weed draws me to get high
Now I'm not tryin' to bend ya arm
I just want you to take a hit off the bong
That's all 

Come on cool it, I'm not foolish
Quit pullin' my leg baitin' me like cob
My name ain't Craig and I ain't lost my job
Don't mind be odd from out the bunch
And why'all cornerin', me ain't stoppin' me from doin' it

Man everybody doin' it 

Let it take ya whole style and feed it

I got the funk to blow ya mind 
I got some shit to blow ya mind 
I got the funk to blow ya mind 
I got some shit to blow ya mind 

Come on
Why'all are actin' like this shit, is supposed to raise me to the clouds

Shit the clips we smokin' on would make Bob Marley proud
And he was one of the illest

Shit one of the illest ever
(He smoked mad trees and still remained clever
I guess ya right

Ain't no need to guess, put it to the test
Ask ya questions alphabetically

Ok, hypothetically if I do take a hit
Do I necessarily have to be tastin' your spit
I mean shit I ain't shared a straw since the fourth grade

But don't chu' know chick like to smoke and get laid
Don't be a dunce it ain't gonna hurt you once

Quit bein' a punk
Go ahead and hit the fuckin' blunt

But will it take a long time to recover

Hey stop that bluffin' like you givin' a survey
And let us serve the hay
And get yo mind alligned to the ways

Of the master

Man I seen a cast a spell
To many brain cells and sane cells
A lead to fulfill wants and needs
I heard it's like a gateway, to doin' more than weed

Man I love my relationship, I'm no quitter
Mary Jane's my first love and I'ma stick with her

And when I feel paranoid

All ya questions is void unless ya try
Come on man for once get high

Hey you don't gotta do anything ya don't want to
It's not gonna change you or ruin your persona

Yeah but what if I can't stop
Shit I ain't with bein' no addict 

Man, please tell him to stop bein' so dramatic
Just take a hit and let the weed do the trick

But will this make me sick

Come on, quit actin' like a bitch
I can blaze the weed and you can make excuses
Now ya gonna smell the smoke, my greenest weed produces
You'd probably like the smell too, ya probably wouldn't admit it
You'd probably want to hit too 
Ya clearly in denial 
How do you know come on, let us give you a trial
Let's put chu' at ease with these trees
Power to heal, put cha' mind at peace
Yeah, increase the level of the highness
My miss express accumulatin' through ya blindness

Let me say something
Just started smokin' 
But uh to all my smokers 
Yeah, let's get em'
Apply pressure, apply the pressure
Apply pressure, let's get em' why'all
Apply pressure

And now for my next number
I'd like to return to the classics
Perhaps the most famous classic
In all the world of music

The first time around you didn't quite
Understand our new style of speak

So, why don't you all just grab your bags?

Plug one, plug two, plug one, plug two
Plug one, plug two, plug one

Answering any other service
Prerogative praised, positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my utility
After the battle they admit that I'm with it

Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue
Transistors are never more shown with like
When vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called, 'Plug tunin''

Flock to the preacher called Pos
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew
Sit while the kid of the plug form aroma
Then grab a daisy to sip your favorite brew

Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe
See that the three will be your thread
But like my man Chuck D said, ?What a brother know?

Dance while I play and the cue cards sway
From my flower girls China and Jette
The button is pressed in '89 we'll start the panic
From De La Soul and a prince from stet

Negative noise will be all divided
Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon
Ducks and kizids will all be rid
When paying position to the naughty noise called, 'Plug tunin''

Plug one, plug two, plug one, plug two
Plug one, plug two, plug one, plug two

Freeze, 'cause these are the brothers
Brothers of the soul who present a new flick
Every last viewer is tuned to the method
Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick

Bitten by the spoken who been titled plug two
Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz
Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative

Flow to the sway 'cause I say, ?Fa So La Ti?
At the top we will dwell
Difference is fame and we rise then we build
Where we are set we get fat and we swell

Motions of the soul is a positive stride
One step forward is the space we consume
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume
How the soul found the motto of a naughty noise called, 'Plug tunin''

Vocal is local so believe that
This chant shan't rely on the strong lap
Trying and live so you best realize
That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap

Style of the tune is personal
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all
Stop, sit and study 'cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all

Watch while the pitcher is pitching
'Cause this is the pitch of the year
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong
Though you heard dove crying 'I ain't fair'

Those who think De La's on the flip tip
Try to flip this and you're doomed
Watch for the be be, 'cause if you try to grieve me
You'll be hung by the wire of the plug tune

I can't twist your arm and make you stay with me

And now for my next number
I'd like to return to the classics
Perhaps the most famous classic
In all the world of music

The first time around you didn't quite
Understand our new style of speak

Just stop takin me for a ride 
 
All I want to do is take my time 
 
Just stop takin me for a ride 
 
All I want to do is take my time 

I'ma stand up for art express  do mic test rehearsals 
Eight years of man livin  ain't no edits or commercials 
Flick the God like mummy, but my own want a debit 
Tossin facts and how they axis don't, spin on a limit 
Ain't no need to dwell, to health I'm fakin your jax 
Ride niggaz get to sittin to rear, so play the Parks of Rosa 
Suppose I have my whole life on it 
Funny how those you love love the evil they do 
I brew the medicine to heal, a bit of verbals we had 
But yo' ideas of heal, is left the surface of it scabbed 
Navigations nearly took me on some cruise type expense 
Dispensin me some shitty canal, I took the juice 
Because I'm used to one-ways, detours and destinations 
Of ways in life, I pretends the knife 
Stuck in my spine'll be a symbol, how Jack can B. Nimble 
But it's time to make that foggy vision crystal 
We gots to get the crystal right 

Just stop takin me for a ride 
All I want to do is take my time 
Just stop takin me for a ride 
All I want to do is take my time 

Take my time 
Well I don't want to go that far 
To sell my soul, I ain't gonna go that far 
I'm takin minds and hearts beyond the shinin star 
Raw dick, honey I don't want to go that far 
So listen why you riskin your mentality against mine 
Sick of leadin love 
Sick of leadin love, leavin love loudfaced 
In the vehicle of mine 
Them want to do awards,  nine ninety-nine, watch em 
Profile the true fall out for so-called friends 
Like mercury and water, we just don't blend 
I end the game technically, you want to stop me 
True gems show affection like Jody Watley, so 

Just stop takin me for a ride 
All I want to do is take my time 
Just stop takin me for a ride 
All I want to do is take my 

Take my, take my time
Take my 
Take my, take my time
Take my  

I recall kissin on my lady, talkin bout makin babies 
Now we made the baby, but cannot connect as legal spouses 
Now me and my daughter reside in different houses 
What louses up the structure, is leavin things up to 
The child lesser, than a child runnin wild from mild pressure 
Mega  nega  tive 
To live a master plan when that plan has no master 
You stare at false tongues, leadin the yung'un to disaster 
Postures of this world is seen as mad crooked 
Want your manhood, but man, your dad took it 
We used to swallow 40's and a whole lot of pride 
Nice MC's be frontin on some whole other vibe 
Just because them albums are sealed, doesn't mean 
Them lyrics are untampered with, let's kill the myth 
That as MC's we know it all, we all children still 
No tricks for ninety-six, it's due time we build man 

Just stop takin me for a ride 
Yes, stop gassin me, stop gassin me 
All I want to do is take my time 
All we want to deal, is reality 
Just stop takin me for a ride 
Stop gassin me, stop gassin me 
'Cause all I want to do is take my time 
Take my time, take my time, c'mon!

Potholes in my lawn

Everybody's sayin'
What to do when suckin' lunatics start diggin' and chewin'
They don't know that the Soul don't go for that
Potholes in my lawn
And that goes for my rhyme sheet
Which I concentrated so hard on, see
I don't ask for maximum security
But my dwellin' is swellin'
It nipped my bud when I happened to fall
Into a spot
Where no ink or an ink-blot
Was on a scroll
I just wrote me a new 'mot'
But now it's gone
There's no
Suckers knew that I hate
To recognise that every time I'm writin'
It's gone

Potholes in my lawn

I've found that it's not wise
To leave my garden untended
Cause eyes have now pardoned all laws of privacy
Even paws are after my writer
See, I've found that everyone's sayin'
What to do when suckers are preyin'
On my well-guarded spreadsheets
Oh why, hell does it send up fleets
Of evil-doers through the big hole
To get to evil-doers who dig holes
Which leaves my lawn with lawn-chew
I think I'd better plant traces to give clues
Or better yet call 911
And when they get here I inform them I'm the Plug One
Open a chair and let them realize the reason
For concern of the Soul
Cause we've come down with a case of potholes

Potholes in my lawn

(Who stole, who stole, who stole the cookie
From the cookie jar?)

Now you got the message
What to do when you die
The death that I predict in 'Plug Tunin'
It's a shame that you deny to claim
That you stole my words of fame
That I wrote in my rhyme sheet
Which I concentrated so hard on, see
I don't ask for a barbed wire fence, B
But my dwellin' is swellin'
It nipped my bud when I happened to fall
Into a spot
Where no ink or an ink-blot
Was on a scroll
I just wrote me a new 'mot'
But now it's gone there's no
Suckers knew that I hate
To recoginse that every time I'm writin'
It's gone

Potholes in my lawn

How y'all feelin' out there! You're listening to the Rap De Rap show
And I'm the Doo Doo Man playing all the slammin' rap tunes for all
You Mack Daddies and Mackettes, so hold tight for a one hour rap sweep
On WRMS. Who's the Doo Doo Man?

Who's the Doo Doo Man?

Yeah, ha ha ha. You're listening to MC Rocco Ribs and the BBQ Crew
And when we're not boning that pork, we're in New York listening to
The Rap De Rap Show on WRMS!

Y-y-y-y-yo, this is Kim KC and I'm chillin' with the Suckweed Posse,
And when I'm not home making a hamhock sandwich, I'm listening to
Rap De Rap Show on WRMS. You ravioli heads, we outta here. Ooh ooh
Ooh, the Doo Doo Man!

Yo, yo, what's up, 's up, this is Q-Q-Tip-Tip from a Tribe Tribe
Called Quest Quest Quest, I'm listening to the Doo Doo Man on
WRMS-S-S-S and I'm out!

Yo, my name is MC No Shame, and when I ain't getting busted in bed
With your mama, or sellin' crack to the kids at Amityville High
School, hey I'm listening to my man, the Doo Doo Man, on WRMS, peace!

This this this this is De La Soul, Pos Love
This is Dove Love
Mase Love
And when we're not here we're where?
WRMS y'all, with who? The Doo Doo Man!

Yo, peace, this is the D-I-V-Ine Styler-Ine, and all come inside
Divine, I'm listenig to my man, the Doo Doo Man, on WRMS. I am outta
Here, ha ha ha!

Yo what's up my name is Colonel Bobby, I'm listening to the Doo Doo
Man on WRMS yo, and I'm outta here, peace

Ha, yo, ha ha, the JB's! JB's in the house! Jungle Brothers, word up
On WRMS, Rap De Rap, my man! Like roaches lickin' soup. Doo Doo
Man! Checkin' out the Doo Doo Man

Yo, this is Prince Paul, when I'm not brushing my teeth with DiDi 7 or
Boosting my memory or purchasing real estate tapes, I'm listening
To my stromie, my homie, the Doo Doo Man on WRMS! Rrr-RRAH!

Hey hey hey Paul, I got a job for ya. You know that guy Rufus? That
Mouli? Freakin' lick him

Mmmmm... I fell in love
we're feeling good
Make you want to do good
Now ask me
Do you want to look good?
Wether wearing your ???
Or your rough rider *woof woof*
Giddy up! For Jesus!
Giddy up! For Jesus!
Jesus is everywhere
In the church, you see Jesus
When you go to sleep, you dream Jesus
when you wake up, you see Jesus
When you put your toast in the toast, who'll pop up? *ding* Jesus! 
When you take your clothes out of the dryer, who do you see?  Jesus!
Now I looked in my closest and guess who I saw 
No! But when I turned around, he was right behind me!
He was right behind me! He was right behind me!

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name
And your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name 
And your number
And I'll get back to you

Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
Knocking on my door, saying, "a yo yo"
"I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo"
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I got an answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter's the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, "Yo black, just play me the tape"
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask
"Was it def?"
And with the straighest face I be like, "Hell yes"
I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call
They get

Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name
And your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin
Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Check it out

Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes bi-da miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here bi-da miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, "Yo G, Pos does all the producing"

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny
Jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me Myself and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like
"Yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel"
I be like "Oh swell"
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer
Who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone
She'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

"Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak"
So no problemo, just play the demo
And at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind
Cause I'll just lay it down the line

Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you peace

Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name

And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'

Up in them five-star tellies and two mic rhymes
Be them average MC's of the times
Unlike them, we craft gems
So systematically inclined to pen lines
Without sayin a producer's name, all over the track
Yeah I said it!  What you need to do is get back
To reading credits, we them medics
Alphabetically stuck on that english
And knock it out before we pour
That sure shot more rock co.kane flow

From the top of the key, the 3 Villain
Been on in the game as long as you can wheelie your Schwinn
Turn the corner spinnin, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to Free Power like Wilco
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay huge when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose ski with a fur collar
Hand charged a fee for loose leaf words for dollar
Ya heard?  Holla - broad or dude, we leave food
Eat your team for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon me for the mix-up
Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up
It's a stick up

Now put your blix up, these Riddick Bowe cuts
Is swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20
The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler
Bring your tallest champs like that much taller
Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it
Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant
Camps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans
Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth

Doom brung that bum, there goes that news van again
Act like you knew like Toucan Sam an' 'em
He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast
Your rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace
String 'em up, bring 'em up under whack junk snack
And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked
Foul, we all know the rules bro
You slow, you blow the soup on your fools, his Impulse like Yugo

You go lights, camera, action with no makeup
We De La to the death, or at least until we break up
Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed
They say the good die young, so I added some
Bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from bein hot
It's about if you can handle bein cold or not!
And we was told to hop for no one, s'what I dig bout Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin
Hey your lady's winkin, I think you need to control that aura
Or I can hold her

The elements are airborne, I smell the success

Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers
Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips
Sippin broads like 7-Up  so refreshing
I think I'll pop these verse like first dates to birthdates
September 2-1, 1-9, 6-8
Too old, should I?  Too bad, too late

Up in them five-star tellies and two mic rhymes
Be them average MC's of the times
Unlike them, we craft gems
So systematically inclined to pen lines
Without sayin a producer's name, all over the track

Ya heard?  Holla - broad or dude, we leave food
Eat your team for sure, the streets sure seem rude
For fam like the Partridges, pardon me for the mix-up
Battle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up
It's a stick up

Now put your blix up, these Riddick Bowe cuts
Is swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20
The danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler
Bring your tallest champs like that much taller
Ten pounds heavier, one step ahead of it
Vocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant
Camps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans
Even your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth

Doom brung that bum, there goes that news van again
Act like you knew like Toucan Sam an' 'em
He eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast
Your rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace
String 'em up, bring 'em up under whack junk snack
And get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked
Foul, we all know the rules bro
You slow, you blow the soup on your fools, his Impulse like Yugo

You go lights, camera, action with no makeup
We De La to the death, or at least until we break up
Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed
They say the good die young, so I added some
Bad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from bein hot
It's about if you can handle bein cold or not!
And we was told to hop for no one, s'what I dig bout Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin
Hey your lady's winkin, I think you need to control that aura
Or I can hold her

The elements are airborne, I smell the success

Sacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers
Puff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips
Sippin broads like 7-Up  so refreshing
I think I'll pop these verse like first dates to birthdates
September 2-1, 1-9, 6-8
Too old, should I?  Too bad, too late

Now let's get right on down to the skit
A baby is brought into a world of pits
And if it could've talked that soon
In the delivery room
It would've asked the nurse for a hit
The reason for this?
The mother is a jerk
Excuse me, Junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new light
What a way
But this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway
Push couldn't shove me to understand a path to a basehead
Consumer should erase it in the first wave
But second wave forms believers
And believers will walk to it then even talk to it and say...

Nah, can't have none of that, tell 'em what to say Mase...

SAY NO GO

Nah, no my brother
No my sister
Try to get hip to this
Word, word to the mother
I'll tell the truth so bear my witness
Fly like birds of a feather
Drugs are like Pleather
You don't wanna wear it
No need to ask that question, just don't mention
You know what the answer is

Now I never fancied Nancy
But the statement she made held a plate of weight
I even stressed it to Wade

Did he take any heed?

Nah, the boy was hooked, you could've phrased the word "Base"
And the kid just shook
In his fashion class once an A now an F
The rock rules him now
The only designs left
Were once clothes made for Oshkosh
Has converted to nothing but stonewash

Now hopping in a barrel is a barrel of fun
But don't hop in if you want to be down, son
Cause that could mean down and out as an action
What does it lead to?
Dum-da-dum-dum
People say what have I done for all my years
My tears show my hard-earned work
I heard shoving is worse than pushing
But I'd rather know a shover than a pusher
Cause a pusher's a jerk

SAY NO GO

Believe it or not the plot forms a fee more that charity
But the course doesn't coincide with the ride of insanity
Is it a chant that slants the soul to fill for it?
I know it's the border that flaunts the order to kill for it

Standing, scheming on a young one
Taking his time, eight-ball for a cool pool player
Racked it all, tried to break, miscued
Got beat by the boy in blue
Next day you're out by the spot once more
Looking hard for a crack in the hole
I ask what's the fix for the ill stuff
Word to the Dero
The answer should have been no

Run me a score from the Funky Four Plus One More

Rewind that back
This is the age for a new stage of fiend
Watch how the zombies scream
It's the crack
Plain is plain it should explain it from the start
Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart
Now the base claim's shot over every part

SAY NO GO

DON"T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT

SAY NO GO

SAY NO GO

Now check it 
Let me set the mood here aight? 
We gonna, set it off with In-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee, -deed
 You know
La-la-la-la-ladies first and all that

So peep it - you see this girl
who been poppin MAD shit about you
So I want you to get into it a little bit
I want you to cru-cru-cru-crush that ??

I was sittin on my lunchbreak, grittin my teeth
It's the last day of the week, man what a relief
My arms are sore as hell, I felt rigid and stiff
so I turned around and I rolled this big fat spliff
That's when I seen her, steppin out a rented yellow Beemer
This local ghetto fame rap cat her name was Tina
She was braggin she was goin on tour
The same shit she was screamin since the year before
Ever since the De La Soul video, she seen me on the TV
Heard that she was holdin a grudge and tryin to see me
Workin underground circuits and mad cyphers of people
When she asked who was ill, all she got was Indeed
She want to battle  and it wasn't hard to tell
All that I was thinkin bout was tryin to smoke my L
I had four hours left and I was tired as hell
Plus it was 12:55 almost time for the bell
She had an ill screwface mug, frontin like she know Joe
Gangsta bitch profile, boppin like allegro
Forty-below Timbos, fatigues saggin
Pullin all her money out her pocket while she's braggin
on her gold fronts with her name on it
Her ice finger roll hand g-low while she claim fame on it
I peeped the stee' - then I crushed her with ease
just for interruptin me while I was rollin my trees

AIGHT? 
That shit was bla-bla-bla, bla-blaze! 
Now we gon' se-se-set, se-set this one up
for my man Mercenary 
 Yo, I don't want you to make it like
a story or nuttin 
I just want-want, want want-want
want you to come on some straight rhy-rhy-rhyme
rhy-rhy, rhy-rhme shit - rip a nigga in his ass!
And let him know how WE do it, why-why-why'know?

Now Maseo puff cheeba, while Rich sniff lines
David J push the whip while Candy Cal pull dimes
And me right behind, with the shorty gettin her math
to do the ?? ?? and just, tap that ass
Still the one who kill wackness, man I left them niggaz crippled
Had em all soft to hard back to soft like a nipple
My +Art is Official+ while you're art-ificial
Break you down to your very last participle
Let me enlighten you, cause your third eye's on dim
Me gettin taken out is rare like a smile from Rakim
See I'm remarkable, you're just bull
last name shit, why'all niggaz need to quit
Open your mitt, and catch this
I autograph every word you bit
??Testify then?? take your picture
Got an infinity of non-rhymes to hit ya
while your whole clan is blam
Understand that you must be smokin POUNDS of weed out of a pipe
and mistook your munchies, for bein hungry for the mic
And now you have to deal with these cats who's truly right
like estates with a pit on the lawn bark at the gates
Put the whole entire plate in your face
Make the point like who's that on that joint? It's me
I'm in everything you see like ??, yo I'm in demand
I'm in the club man I'm in your hand
bein bought, I'm even in the thought from your girl
The only thing you're in is in acting
Your world'll be smashed
Run against the Won and you'll be last
like that call for alcohol, depletin your cash

That's how you supposed to get in somebody ass
why'knowhatmsayin? Know-know-know, know-know, know-know dat!
Hahahahahaha

{*ghost weed skit 2 follows*}

Shake it up...shake it up girl
Shake it up...bass
Hey! Shake it up...shake it up

She makes me think of lightning in skies
 She's sexy!!
How else is God supposed to write
 She's sexy!!
Move, she wants to move
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her
She wants to move 
She wants to move 
But you're hogging her, you're guarding her 

Mister! Look at your girl, she loves it!

Her ass is a spaceship I want to ride

Move, she wants to move
But you're hogging her, and guarding her
She wants to move 
She wants to move

Somebody get us some water in here!
'Cause it's hot!

Hot y'all! Hey! Huuuhh!
 Ehh

Woman talking: We not going to JC Penney's, we not going to Macy's either

Shopping bags they weigh down her arm
Popping tags and collars her charm
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you
Manolo and Prada's her style
Louis, Burberry by the pile
All them things she got, she got from you
All them things she got, she got from you

Yo she know you come to do it, so what you want
Candle light might flick you
Put your credit card to it, she know what to flaunt
Her handle tight like a master

She used to taunt on the runway, yeah she's down to tree
The avenue like her catwalk
Struck a bit to the gun play, that housing street
looks to die for, ask that chalk man for yo' hand

Spend it, you live to show
All the cash that you can burn
What you need is to end it, cause you give the dough
But get no ass back in return

Stay laughing, straight at you dog
Best believe, you wasting time
Don't deny what's happening, just clear the fog
And achieve you a peace line, yo it goes like

She got from you, she, sh-she, she got it
She got from you, she, sh-sh, sh-she got it

Her frame goes beyond thick, she got you stunned
Living it up off the pop hits
Like a dame on a Bond flick, she's not the one
To give it up 'til you cop shit
J
ust because she's stacked right, she got your soul
Her every wish you now obey
You should be on that act right, but she got control
She say jump you scream, "Okay! I'm reloaded!"

Nigga you shooting blanks
Trying to front like you got game
Her crib is sugar coated, like she looting banks
But it's your wallet she done claimed

When the limit of your plastic, reaches the end
You start paying for your time
She'll be in it for the last bit, of money to spend
And you'll be left with dimes
While she filling up

She got from you, she, sh-she, she got it
She got from you, she, sh-sh, sh-she got it

The Shwingalo, hot damn

I am, I am

I present to you the Preacher Man
Peace everyone, everyone I hope
Plate is not a caper, plate is not a hoax
Is it is the now step, labeled Shwingalo
Shopper brag a basket, fill it to the bro
What's the Shwingalokate? Question me instead
Mental is the mood, whether live or dead
Level is the groove when I lead the led
But hip is my lip when I'm Shwinging it

It's the fool of the clan

I am, I am

I present to you, the whole shalam
Last was the gas, flower by the pound
Shoo, puppy tough, shoo, flower power hound
Season of the Shwing is sound and it's bound
90 got the gift so lift from the ground
Speak me an age, age at the dough
Feed me the donut, feed me the O
School me with the new cause the new
Kept me fed with the brew
I'm glued to the stew and I'm Shwinging it

Breathe me the out, breathe me the in
Send it with a skit neither friend nor begin
Label it a Shwing, brother come for the win
Catch me the border, must start to begin
90 got the knack of the Soul, grab a bit
90 proved them wrong to those who commit
Dis to the hit list, pitched by the hit
Caught by the herds of those in the pit
Pull me a puff of the blunt as it breeds
This benefit's just what you need
Just because I'm fallin', saved by the weed
With dred, cause you know indeed I'm shwinging it

Constructed like an apple but roll like a grape
Try with the games cause the fools'll take shape
Stuff to the too tough, grave is in the groove
Sop it like Sound, yo honey make a move
Shufflin' your feet, that's stiffer than a nap
Open up an eardrum, don't wait for the cap
Sip a third of lager, extract the waste
Tell me tell me tell me, can you get a case?
Never oops honey, dope not a threat
Peace be found on your color telly set
Pick up the proof for the stool pigeon sing
Shwing a load o' dat, cause I must put Shwing

Fear through time, is left behind, when we simply, havin
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home
Take some time, and ease your mind, when we simply, havin
A wonderful time, a beautiful time, leave the troubles you find at home

Hey, yo last day of spring first day of the heat 
I'm calling out my troops so ya'll best retreat 
Tryin' to win the eyes off of Little Bo Peep
While I'm pushin' Big Bird up Seaseme Street 
After one nut I'm goin' straight to sleep 
If it ain't a love affair, its just a late night creep 
Use Colgate when I'm brushing my teeth 
Favorite MC's Gregg Nice and Smooth be	 
Keep it old school like "Where's the beef?" and
If you ain't from an era then you up shit's creek 
First be	-side is freedom of speak
If you don't speak, well I ain't losin' no sleep.
See me on the cover of your Double X-L 
Takin' a holiday at the hotel 
Fans keep sending me back the fan mail
Heavyweights keep it on th grand scale, when we doin' it.
Chorus 

Hey, yo, The sky swallowed the sun
spitted out the moon and stars
Puttin' out shiners that gave the cause
ArmorAll-ed down, the downtown activity
I'm bout to have fun without the problems that live with me
Not tryin' to be posh, but lets stay out the mosh pit
Tonight keep my nose out of trouble
Everybody in my bubble's been breifed:
NO BEEF, JUST PARTY!
Of course your gonna have some clown niggaz try to
take us off course
Always lower levels tryin' to bring out the devil in us
Not condoned but its known
That a party ain't a party if the thugs don't try to shut it down!
Tight security and its still soft
Can't offset the thirty or plus caught in the rush
Keep the door sealed
Cause the floor's filled with action and we don't need
any distractions tonight ya'll.

introduce me to your madaam ?Mauzel?
I'm Tarzan and she's my gazelle
I live at Biggs and say its notorius
Travel through minds, emotions and euphorias
Glorius  as I get great 
Still kinda smooth like way back in my oldschool tapes
I bring it pronto
Rep the BX like Billy Blanco

Treat your troubles like colds
Sweat it out, get it out
So we can get in the right mode
Let it out
No need to pull on the throttle
If I could bottle this love I wouldn't hesitate
Get it straight
Wonder why I can medicate the soul
While takin' its toll
Just for Simply  Havin'
The right record that could bring in the pull
And this must be the right run ya'll
Cause the dancefloor's full 'cause!
Chorus to fade 

Hello boys and girls. Welcome to your De La Soul readalong storybook! 
When you hear this sound, that means turn the page. 
And now we begin our exciting adventure of, De La Soul is Dead. 

Oh my God  Vanilla Ice
He's so fly! 
The boy is so good. 
Did you see his body? 
He could dance too. 
He could. 
He's better than any rapper I ever seen! 
And plus his dancers! 
He's so jammin'! 

Yo, what's up? 
Yo, Jeff, where you been, man? 
Guess what I just found, I just found a De La Soul tape in the garbage. 
For real? Let's hear it!

High and Rising, this is Don Newkirk.

L-why-are to the I-see-S
Niggaz still fussin' bout who be the best
When diggy-dawg bounce too I put all that to rest
Anyone try test I put two in they chest
Quest or no Quest I leave venues a mess
Don't ask me to collab me and you don't mess
I stay fresh from the fresh never front nor 'fess
In the name of J. Christ all mic's'll get blessed
P: power possess flavor, style, finesse
Microphone honeys two things I caress
To all you fake Jiggy-niggaz, STILL not impressed
Queens: I rep it to the fully, you'll think I own the Mets

Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh!
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh!

 Chaka Khan 

It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should - it's all on you

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's - all on you-whoahhha-ohhh-yeah

I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want 
The lovin that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's invitin' so visualize the verb
You curve thought ways when you're handlin' the candelabra
So you sittin' on the baby grand
Transmittin' like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'ma tell you quick that uhh...

Chorus 1/2

I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together
No pepperoni
Yeah you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora
Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with reppin for D

We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claimin never been gone
Niggaz who cut us off, want to reattach us now

Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick 
So stick to the same plan, don't come shakin my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all..

Chorus

You see them kids be schemin on what we done copped
Always out there schemin!
They steady fiendin for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiendin?

Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothin guaranteed

That's the truth!  Things ain't goin like you think they should

A lot say they want to walk in my size 10's
Aight then; here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head
Tryin to keep my pockets on stuffed - like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all DON'T FAZE
So mind your biz and walk away
Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been there and paid my dues
I can't change how you feel, cause it's all, on you-whoahhha-ohhhhh

Chorus

..............

We don't live for Hip-Hop, It lives for us

It's the eternalist, y'all burn to this, blaze da dro'
Soul rebels trap up, we got a long way to go
Before this here blow like a volcano
We get eternal, this is what you waitin' for
You try to front and play the role
When you more like a pimp who pay the ho
With my name up in your mouth like fellatio
I lace the flow on purpose even up the ratio
Of Hip-Hop to that shit they drop on the radio
Underground classics is what they used to say before
Now we break the surface quiet like an alligator nose
They hate it, cuz they know if they don't get it, then they may be slow
We still gonna blow like the horn played by Horatio
The stakes is three feet high and risin' like De La Soul
So I got Wonder Why, my man Dave and Maseo
We all got babies so we embrace the taste of dough
But y'all already know so I ain't gotta say no mo'

 is whatcha need,  is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees 
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D
 if you're somebody
Party to party, body to body
When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle

Yo! I'm homegrown for the bain, once I rock the mic plain
It's the extravaganza we glad you came
Made only for them heads, it's infra-red Aim
For such a world figure, we got figures to gain

I ain't Icabod Crane get that ass cooked hard cuz we raw like Kane
Been known to mic spit, infinite per frame
While these girls throw me plenty like jenny to jane
Ain't some old school G poppin' memory lane, been on it future robotic
Since the day I came
If you don't know Plug Wonder Why is my name
Most recognized leo with my size in mane
Matter a fact track is simple and Plain
Cuz the complexities I freeze is too deep to detain
Reflect, Kwa-Tone Tek eternally in the game  oh fo' sho'
We be shinin' the same

 is whatcha need,  is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees 
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D
 if you're somebody
Party to party, body to body
When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle

Y'all think these challengers is here to make a man fold
Shoot I've been holdin' these joints since I was day old
Came to confirm the fact that I've been on the payroll
Stay cold til one day make it hot and fade old
Continue til I'm dyin, rottin' out gray and old
I told them fool before they pass they have to pay toll
While I've been sittin' at the table eatin' steak whole, side of greens
Baby yams you know it stay soul, pre-natal
But they want to come spit your way so
So was I supposed to go and say no
Right emcees some walking straight, some take the gay stroll
I get my man to clamp they asses like they staples
I'm from LI we take it far as out as naples
And scrape hoes who'll be willing to take clothes off 
See once you bet it all against reflects eternal
You lose every rapper on a dept
Y'all need to pay ya dues

 is whatcha need,  is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees 
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D
 if you're somebody
Party to party, body to body
When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle

Turn that shit off man, what's wrong with you man?
You know we got a party man, get the other record

Just one more time, from 'Stix N Stonz'

It's the M I K E, ohh, to the D
I'm comin' exquisite and V.I.P.
Tryin' to spread some love like roots on a tree
Stayin' true to this vision in the Y2G

Two G's got 'em scratchin' it like the fleas
And Ad Rock got it locked like a crooked cop
Now, it's Ad Rock, y'all remember me
The guy ya bit ya style from off the TV

I score Mmmma-Zah-Ayy's all day
My essays are felt worldwide
We like four planets on the mic
Aligned arrays retired all in the days
Game, too blam for these lames

When I was nine, I played with slime
Got rhymes ga-lot, got rhymes ga-limes
I got a million like rhymes leavin' ya stung
I got my own crew called the nasal tongue

Yo take a few of these be-boys and call me in the mornin'

Keep it on the crusty eye, bagel with some butterflies
Spit gritty like we in MCA's voice box
Y'all bull and my ox don't fit the mix

It be some classic material kid

Got the calm cats blowin' their lid

You get plush off the rack

And buy plenty or more we got em by the stack

Got us walkin' all over the world
For all the fly fellas and all the fly girls

You can't get enough when we servin' this

Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat

Now we'd like to introduce to you, Ad Rock

Ad Rock in the house you don't stop
It's the be E A S T I E be O why S with the most finesse
Don't mean to be crude, don't mean to be crass
But listen Guiliani you can kiss my ass

You heard my word, now Dove you play the preacher
Get on the mic if you love all the creatures

Well yeah, I got these fishes swimmin' 'round my baracuda
Back in '82 I used to ride a street scooter
Called 'em cuter than pigtails, sales you keep 'em level
And smack you with a shovel and break your lifestyle

Firm on the mic since my days of a child
Got a 'License Too Ill' to flash to police
The only beast I huddles with the Beastie Boys
Bringin' 'Noise' like P.E. to your TV

Aiyyo, this beat's barefoot and knock-kneed
Stripped to the rhyme
And every line made from scratch
Attached like stripes to shell-toes
Thin spools that hold the herb
Mike what's the word?

It's like the ooh-la-la, ooh-ooh-la-la
Rhymin' over old breaks like the Mardis Gras
Party people cross and bump they go, ooh, and they, ahh
And Mike D and Ad Rock down with the De La

Get the people dancin for real

Theater holdin' mass appeal

You can't get enough still
So here's another dose for you to feel
Put ya body in it

Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat
Come on Squat, come on Squat

I'm feelin' good, damn good but also confused
This stuff from hip-hop that's bein' misused
It's desirin', acquirin', tryin' to be like Iverson
If it means backstabbin' and also conspirin'

Now, the people in the front, you do the bump, bump
The people in the back, they're not the whack, whack
The people in the middle, come on and wiggle, wiggle
And the people on the side, we can all take a ride

In my VW I done swung an ep' or two
The rear in my hatchback y'all know I scratched that
Here to haystack, keep it rosy in the Rolls
Skiddin' out to place my vote at the polls for Ad Rock

Well, I'm the the toe tapper, yes the hand clapper
From the middle school like the educated rapper
I'm known as an occupational MC
You think I lose sleep if you sleep on me?

It's the rock solid, pilot, here to fly

Reachin' elevations too far for the eye

Miraculous beats over breaks in these packages
Seen and all the types

Who thinks our joints is aight, here's a swab for ya ear

And listen to a few views
From two crews spittin' for the art of it
We ain't takin' over but damn sure takin' part of it

Started it ever since we minced meat
You Sloppy Joe's went and took a bit of the corn dog
Stay there, I'ma play there

In the big old Santa Claus bag got discs and now we out

Signin' off, signin' off, our work is done
So come on party people
Have, have, have fun

Just one more time, from 'Stix N Stonz'

The Instamatic focal point bringing damage to your boroughs
Be some brothers from the east with some beats that be thorough
Got the solar gravitation so I'm bound to pull it
I gets down like brothers are found ducking from bullets
Gun control means using both hands in my land
Where it's all about the cautious livin'
Migrating to a higher form of consequence, compliments
Of strugglin', that shouldn't be notable,
Man every word I say should be a hip hop quotable.

I'm sick of bitches shakin' asses
I'm sick of talkin' about blunts,
Sick of Versace glasses,
Sick of slang,
Sick of half-ass awards shows,
Sick of name brand clothes.
Sick of R&B bitches over bullshit tracks,
Cocaine and crack
Which brings sickness to blacks,
Sick of swoll' head rappers
With their sicker-than raps
Clappers and gats
Makin' the whole sick world collapse
The facts are gettin' sick
Even sicker perhaps
Stickabush to make a bundle to escape this synapse

Man life can get all up in your ass baby you betta work it out
Let me tell you what it's all about
A skin not considered equal
A meteor has more right than my people
Who be wastin' time screaming who they've hated
That's why the Native Tongues have officially been re-instated

Stakes is high

You know them stakes is high

When we talkin' 'bout the

Stakes is high, you know them stakes is high
When we dealin' with the

Stakes is high

Yo, it's about love for cars, love for funds
Loving to love mad sex, loving to love guns
Love for opposite, love for fame and wealth
Love for the fact of no longer loving yourself, kid
We living in them days of the man-made ways
Where every aspect is vivid,
these brothers no longer talk shit
Hey yo, these niggas live it
'Bout to give it to you 24/7 on the microphone
Plug One translating the zone
No offense to a player, but yo, I don't play
And if you take offense, fuck it, got to be that way
J.D. Dove, show your love, what you got to say?

I say G's are making figures at a high regard
And niggas dying for it nowadays ain't odd
Investing in fantasies and not God
Welcome to reality, see times is hard
People try to snatch the credit, but can't claim the card
Showing out in videos, saying they cold stars
See, shit like that will make your mama cry
Better watch the way you spend it
'Cause the stakes is high

Y'all know them stakes is high
When we talkin' 'bout the

Stakes is high

I think that smiling in public is against the law
'Cause love don't get you through life no more
It's who you know and "How you, son?"
And how you gettin' in, and who the man holding
Hey yo, and how was the scams and how high
Yo what up, huh? I heard you caught a body
Seem like every man and woman shared a life with John Gotti

But they ain't organized!

Mixing crimes with life enzymes
Taking the big scout route
And niggas know doubt better
Than they know their daughters
And their sons

Yo, people go through pain and still don't gain
Positive contact just like my main man
Who got others cleaning up his physical influence
His mind got congested
He got the nine and blew it
Neighborhoods are now hoods cause nobody's neighbors
Just animals surviving with that animal behavior
Under I who be rhyming from dark to light sky
Experiments when needles and skin connect
No wonder where we live is called the projects
When them stakes is high you damn sure try to do
Anything to get the piece of the pie
Electrify
Even die for the cash
But at last I be out even though you wantin' more
This issue is closed like an elevator door
But soon re-opened once we get to the next floor where the

Chorus: all

If you can dig it, deal with it, if you can't, just forget it
Cause nobody rocks the party like we
Get loose, get loose, sunshine get loose
Just rock, and show 'em you got juice
And have, have, have, have, have, have, have fuuuuuuun!

Verse 1: la sunshine

I know it's been a while since the last time
You're heard la sunshine pick up the microphone and rhyme
But now I think it's time to go for mine
So you can sit back, relax, just max and unwind
Because it's time for me to out a few heads to bed
Because I'm upset at what somebody said
I've heard it through the grapevine it's been said
That sunshine, can't rhyme? 
Ha! that's the funniest line that I heard in a long time
The wanna be me's that they I sound off beat
I'm not off beat, I'm totally unique and it sounds real sweet
So if you're ready, get set for a trip to the sun
You'll be guided, and I've decided to become
One to take total control of your soul
Young or all be bold because it's a sight to behold

Chorus:

Sticks and stones might break your bones but pos is gonna blow your mind
Ain't no need to hold it  just one more time!

Verse 2: posdnuos

Now you can bet that I'm first kick a watt
Soul son, plug one, posdnuos I'm top notch
Forward, backstep, got cabbage on the brain
So I'm leafy, peasy, and I act kind of sane
So homeboys and girls just come follow me
I'm the fried pipe piper down with dub and plug three
I like my mans, freestyle is not my flow
But I gets mad respect from norfolk to glasgow
I run this up to court about a minute to the sec
Cause my hoodie won't clash with whipper whip's mockneck
So my hip-hop teachers please show me the math
And after this give me your goddamn autograph

Chorus:

Whipper whip, you can make the microphone sing
Walking around sporting your diamond ring
All the ladies know you as an mc king
So get on the mic and tell 'em it ain't no thing

Verse 3: whipper whip

Well the prince is my title and, I do what I must do
When rappers get beside themselves, that's when I bust two
Or three, see it doesn't matter to me
Cause the w-h-i-p's got an army
Whipper whip, the whipster, money gripster
Can't stand the tipster unless she got the hips to
Move a mountain, left on kingsly and fountain
1345 is where I used to count them
The grips in my bucket's the kind that choke horses
No more losses and no toy mosses
It's the kings of kingsly, from bronx to hollywood
I'm whipper whip, I but the g in good
Yo I can blow like a whistle, run far beyond average
Been rapping to the man like randy savage
You be the judge, come stand as I slam some
There's open invitation to all and then some

Chorus:

Sticks and stones might break your bones but jd dub is gonna blow your mind
Ain't no need to hold it  just one more time!

Verse 4: dove

I kick the chatanooga choo choo so listen to the calling
Next stop's the body rock, here's the ticket to my clock
It's the flips, but keep your jaws on your hips
>from back in the days I used to air it to the hits
Earn the dance step and guaranteed to play the wheel to wheel
And wild style was the real, dig it? 
I block the heckles and hecks and gets nuff respects
Without the bah diddy bah I couldn't go and cash checks

Chorus:

Dj mase, since you got the bass, why don't you hit it, hit it? 
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it!

The do re, the mi phi, the sol la, the tito
Rocking it, rocking it, yes he is rocking it
Tito, rocking it!

Verse 5: tito

Smiggity smoking, no joking, turning styles like a token
No singer, but swinging rap lyric like a ringer
I'm solo, like bobo, breaking backs like bolo
No kitten, no hitting booby traps for the sitting
Ducks should I mention rhyme breezing like benson
Or hedges, I'm fuming autographs for the human
Being, I'm g-ing, off like keying
Or keenan, live ivory, waynan, who's slaying? 
A tv or movie, hit singles often move me
Like groove me, they got me lingers like a ? ? ? 
No slipping, no tripping on me while I'm ripping
Slam dunking like a donut on the bulls scottie pippen
A vocab that's no fad, I'm heftier than glad bags
My son's about 2, buckaroo and yelling go dad!

Chorus:

Sticks and stones might break your bones but superstar's blows your mind
Ain't no need to hold it  just one more time!

Verse 6: superstar

I get the honor to rap with some old school greats
Caz, whipper whip, tito, and la
Maseo, posdnuos, trug, they from the new school
A perfect blend from the old and new
Superstar, where did I fit in? how did I get in? 
Where did I begin, sin? 
I'm known from belcourt to freeport, not a west coast or five boroughs
Yeah, my name's whispered in the ghettos
When I'm on stage, I write a book, flip a page
Write a chapter, and leave a hell of a phrase
Now, before I go, you know that I'm a pro, yo
You won't forget me, why, because I flow

Chorus:

So gmc, ha, gmc, ha ha, gmc ha, gmc, ha ha
Gmc, ha huh! 
Yo, get on the mic, stay on the mic 
Rock on the mic with your rhymes galore!

Verse 7: grandmaster caz

Well I'm a black act back to attack the wack new jack
Smack the sad sack track with the stack of facts
True old data, see you later alligator
Raid or raider darth vader, cause I'm greater or rater
Made a plate of soul food, barbequed a rude dude with the attitude
Who got screwed cause he chewed
But I'm a writer, you can't take a bite of
So light up your lighter and watch me recite a
Dope verse or two with the curse or two, yeah rehearse a cue
But first a few minutes of funk, preferably seven
Microphones, all I need is one
Mc's to school, ten or eleven then a bottle of don
When the job is done, but don't stop me now
I'm on a roll, control the whole stroll
And bowl the whole toll, fold the known souls
Patrol shoot the fruit, toot toot the hoot
Scoot with the loot and knock a cute suit boots
Entertain your brain like kane, not strain to maintain my main  stain
Walls record us, break through the borders
All the manslaughters and kidnap daughters
Who are building and chlling in the building with a villian
I'm killing and illing but still in like bob dylan
I'm democratic emphatic erratic static I'm good at it
And suckers get gatted with the automatic
Rhymes are plenty, styles are many
Yeah, and that's as real as jimmy sticking jenny
If anybody knows a trick to slip my wig
With a lick or real sick with a lyrical brick
He's a vick bound to get tracked off
Step to the grandest and you'll get slapped off
Stage, and thoroughly stomped with the quickness
Now can I get a witness, cause I'm out

And yes y'all
You are about to bear witness
From the lands of long island
Takin' you to the sky's survival
I am your captain, enola
On this endless joruney
To invisions, to broaden your outer visions
To where you never been before
It's just a one night trip to love
Sun shinin' forever, and forever sun shines

Yo, leaving lasting impressions like cuts to flesh
Be that crew from the five one six point of view
With skills so tight, they the rhymes of a vagina
Them clits will turn into a diamond, the level of rhymin'
Pressure comes from lesser forms than me and my man
And we go back like life created from um, specks of sand
And there's money to be made cause cacaussians are paid
Only brothers who
Rhyme, seek bounce and catch balls
Plug 1, with them rhymes makin' your heart stall
Like them girls when you in they room when they man calls
It ain't nothin' but the thing wonder why can bring
As we come to the bring the pain everyone will sing

De la is the crew that you must hear
But please don't rush the stage
Cause even though them stakes are really high
We're really not here to race
We're just here to move your mind and soul
With perpetuated ease
It's just about the show until it's time to go
And get with the young ladies

I'm on travellin' to places that the eye can't see
But kinder, cause yo' strife don't mean a thing to me
Throwin' me criminal looks, y'all need to get in the books
And drop some water in your melon, 'stead of actin' like a felon
Aiyo son, who you tellin'? I'd make a mil if it was up to me
But since it ain't I teach my seed to bank hard
And than god, I smoke a substance of a different kind
Catch me trippin' on earth when I'm high off sunshine

Down right to dirt, wonder why makes it work
With access to talent like caucasians to yellow cabs
With an arab driver
I liven parties with marvelous confiction
Ain't no fricition when life claims them victims who be some dried up funds
Best believe that the life is strife
Cause the gun made a man outta pussys from around my way
Who usually wouldn't have a fuckin' thing to say
Last year's hard rocks are now petrified boulders
And l.i.'s finest is movin' yo' necks at shows
The anthem of ths guy has a place in yo' eye
So you can be blessed to see in 3d double-e

Hey  whatever happened to the emcees
Times done changed for the emcees
Every woman and man want to emcee
But for what  I tell you emceeing ain't for you
Hey  whatever happened to the emcees
Times done changed for the emcees
Every woman and man want to emcee
But for what  I tell you emceeing ain't for you

Man I'm on the set like the flicks so let your parents flash
A splash bigger than whales, I'm makin' monsters mash
Spit Pinnochio's theory when shit be looking weary
I need rest, but I boogie for now, I'm on some mess
Like the best mics respond to me
Living days, like dreams of specializing in the art that pays
I be a mystic for life, so check my ID number
Emcees be kneading/needing dough while I make bread like wonder
Yes, that's what you heard, so save that acting for the screen
See you can can that manager with the beans
I bust emcees like lies surprise em out the box
Put away the soda pops I'd rather rub on the rocks 
A dime-getter tried to get what I got, for what 
I guess Southern folks cash makes the lovin' come fast 
But I'm past alla that, it's time to break with the breeze 
Get to your knees, here comes the Supa Emcees 

Within this program of rap, I'll eradicate the glitches 
Yo I'm dark like Wesley, but I be sparkin more bitches 
And to them my constellation put your lives in jep 
While you others represent, I present my rep 
Cause when it comes to making dents, I'm that main in print 
Even smoked from blunts which give eyes the reddish tint 
Could not prevent, you from seeing I'm the light 
But bring attention to my words like some ads in tights 
I heard you want to fight me, with your words on stage 
So Mase pulls that instrumental from the jam you made 
And as he starts cutting what you sold, I'll talk all over your tones 
As if my name was Pete Rock or Sean "Puffy" Combs 
Send your tattered ass home, with celly phones I roam 
With my fleet, here to make this rap game complete 
While you live fables, unstable, acting very radical 
Projecting like you're hard, when in fact you're quite vaginal 

This morning you've got time for a hot, home-cooked breakfast
Delicious and piping hot in only three microwave minutes

Yo, pretty package is of frosted delights
Look, it comes with a toy
Hehe, I like that
I wanna number four, a number six, and throw in a plastic doughnut
Just enjoy the gritty crunch that tastes just like chicken
Wrappers of many bite sizes
Man, are you freakin' blind? 
That's a rock
All mixed in the potful
Momma's home-made from scratch
Well, not quite
Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
Don't waste time with your net, our net worth is set
Ready, go
Many know others 
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it with the 24-hour sign
Shower my habits while you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots 
Gotta have it super fast

Super fast 
Super fast 
I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through
Whatever blue the night, the night throws at us
Aluminum I crush for fun
Aluminum
The sea is radioactive
The sea is radioactive

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
Don't waste time with your net, our net worth is set
Ready, go 
Many know others 
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it with the 24-hour sign
Shower my habits while you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots

Gotta have it super fast

Super fast 
Super fast I come in last, but just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through
Whatever blue the night, the night throws at us
Aluminum I crush for fun
Aluminum
The sea is radioactive
The sea is radioactive

Superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish, superfast jellyfish
Don't waste time 
The sea has gone silent
What?

Everybody loves jellyfish
Everybody loves jellyfish
Everybody loves jellyfish

Rise and amplifying when we come in wit de swing.

Just follow in de back and naturally harmonizing,
Climb into position wit synchronized things,
Live from out de ghetto we maximizing,
Sound-O-De-Groove-Armada we Superstylin'

Sometimes, can you feel the pressure does unwind,
sometimes 
Sometimes, in true the day and true the night,
sometimes 
Sometimes, you can make the pressure does unwind,
sometimes 
Sometimes, it's for your spirit and your mind,
sometimes

Hey Love
Talkin' bout Hey Love
Wanna be your push and shove
Pop, popcorn up above
Move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love
Discover all the football teams
Mack and eat jelly beans
Run in the cold with no jeans
Get yourself sick till we're seen
Catch the flu and make tea
How Dan Stuckie life will be
It's all about you and me
Cause you're my Hey Love

Move me like Soul when I say
Go to a club around the way
And see my Hey DJ
And make him play Hey Love

Look Pos, we gotta talk
Talk about what?
Don't play stupid with me, you know what we gotta talk about
What?
About you becoming fully dedicated
So we're about to go through these line-runs again, huh?
You're damn right. I wanna know whatever you do for me has
Anything to do with love
Look, I come all the way from L.I. to the Bronx to see you, isn't
That showing you love?
You see that's just it Pos, I don't wanna be just your Bronx
Love, I wanna be your Hey Love
You wanna be my what?

Being one of the many girls on your
List, and you wouldn't be dissing me like this if I was your Hey Love
Look, I do everything I can to treat you like a rose
Yeah but you even give better treatment to that girl named
Selina from uptown like a Daisy. You even
Gave her some of your special donuts for free
So this is what this is all about, huh? Donuts
No, Pos, can't you hear the music, it's all about Hey Love
I don't understand why you're dissing me, it's not like I'm Paul
I don't have two kids in every state
But you probably got two girls in every state, if you're not
Going to go about it the way I want you
To, then just leave, cause I can't be so bothered
Yeah. And wit your wrinkled pussy

I WAS

On my way, to the disco
You know the club, Maseo was rocking rub that night
Midnight to four, name at the door
But the whole crew I can get in as well
So I got on my cell, called my nigga C. Smith
Let this be a jam that we need not miss
Yeah I'm already en route, no doubt
Might even jump up on the mic
To make sure that this party's turned out
And we some punctual types, on time, look for the line
To stand we find girls screaming the blues
Miscellaneous shoes everywhere
Yo Mase, what happened here?
 Yo Brooklyn, why y'all know the rules
Bump ? people and out come the tools
Ain't been a fair fight since the creation of crews
And that's why them dudes hearts all pumped
Done closed the club down,
Cause one of they niggas got jumped
Jump, jump, jump to it!
Uh-huh, you heard the hook
No matter you Braveheart or shook
You can catch a bottle from the right, tap to the left
Kicks to the mids relieving you of breath
I seen it done sloppy, seen it organized
Some saw it coming and for others it was SURPRISE
Catch a swollen eye and blood loss, courtesy of the
Jump, jump, jump to it!
Jump, jump, jump to it!

Yo! When they put the contracts out, bats and chairs included
Chicks can get into it, 'specially pretty broads
My New York City dogs seem to master the art
When you hear the  that's when the bullshit'll start
It only takes a second less you got on ice
Just for wearing your chain in they club, they'll beat you twice
Served with fried rice, you get a can of whoop ass
My only advice is don't fall and book ass
For the nigga who slip, don't fall in a position
Where your lip'll catch a hickie 
Shoot, go and ask Tara, just for having good hair

Man they left her ass cute, pulled it dead out the roots 
It's never one or two of 'em, they heading out in troops
Timbos, hoodies loose over jumpsuits
Waiting for the first vic to disrespect
Catch a double-dutch rope around your neck in the midst of the
Jump, jump, jump to it! 

It's schematically plotted out to break hearts and bodies
And ya best believe we came to party
Don't cause trouble but still can find double the crew
Against you and your peeps and leap-like-frogs on ya
For reasons like - not in the right part of town
Acting like you wore a crown
Some occasions long and mean to earn the right
To throw signs wearing only one color scheme
And being positive is no exclusion
That's an illusion, you can still catch contusions
For flossing your hard-earned shine
I'm talking games ? the longest
Then it's some other niggas time
You'll get beat out of your mind just for rage
Shit my black ass almost got pulled off stage
Just for holding it down on the mic, you could be talking,
Black people unite, and still catch a lump from the
Jump, jump, jump to it! 

Yo, it's this joint, called the art of getting jumped
We had to put this one on the album why know?
Yeah, this is dedicated 
To them punk motherfuckers out in Germany
That Turkish gang that jumped me up in the fucking club
Tried to knock me senseless
They just couldn't get me though
That's why I second round outside on 'em
Pull out some fucking guns, punk bastards
And that's why my ass was hiding under the bridge

(Yeah for your nation... 
For your nation...) 
Verse One: 
A bitch nigga wit an attitude named Cube 
Step to Com wit a feud 
Now what the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast 
You ain't made shit dope since AmeriKKKa's Most 
Wanted to cease from the Midwest to the East 
On the dick of the East for your 1st release 
Your lease is up at the crib house niggaz get evicted 
And videos wit white boys talking you get Wicked 
Natural Born Killa, nigga you natural born God 
Look, read listen, got the nerve to say you rob 
Hyprocrite, I'm filling out your Death Certificate 
Slanging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence 
Shoulda repented, on the 16th of October 
Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over 
Rap career is over, better off acting 
What trouble I see, you're managing WC and Wack 10 
You backed in to a four corner hustla 
Lying on your dick, said you was fuckin her 
Use Higher Learning, don't take my words out of text 
Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX 
It'll take the Nation of Millions to Hold Me Back 
From giving you mouth shots or hit wit the pipe Ralph got 
When sucker ain't around, it's your Friday, it was good 
I wasn't salty, she was wit the Boyz N the Hood 
Chorus: 
I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind 
The bitch in you, looking me in my eyes lyin 
I see the bitch in you, simply hard, you find 
The bitch in you but yo it's coming out 
Verse Two: 
Up on this rap shit, Cube, I'm calling out 
I break in and smack niggaz that's in the Slaughterhouse 
This ain't no East coast, West coast, none of the above 
I'm from Chi, I went to Cali, niggaz gave me love 
There's a thin line between the fake and the real 
Grafted ass nigga, I see through your Glass Shield 
Had skills once upon a time on this project, yo 
I'm a have ta wreck a Ho'shea 
I heard a ho say you her favorite rapper 
 so I had to slap her, ugn 
And violate you, a Muslim drinking brew 
Your nigga ain't no Mack 10, he's a 22 
I seen you, you ain't say shit to ATL 
Cube, I like that diamond charm, I might cuff it, then sell 
It out, like you sold Kam and Threat 
A year ago, you wasn't talking shit about the West 
Guess you knew you're shit was done plus the one got you cable 
Hoo Bangin, you ain't banging shit but the table 
And the Circle Madd, ain't got no choice but to fight 
Ain't none of y'all muthafukas got a chance on the mic 
Anytime you come out, yo, I'm a talk about you 
Until you let that bitch in you, walk up out you 
Any last words before I hit the switch 
From the immortal words of one, a bitch is a bitch 
Chorus 

And and bass up the track a little bit 
'Cause I I'm here I want to hear that boom bish boom  knowhatI'msayin? 
Yeah yeah you know the bizness 
Common Sense  soul with the De La 
Get all them play ahs 
We the rhyme sayers 
Huh  and that's the bizness  hah 
Gonna do it like this 
Gettin it that 
Like the Chicago streets 

I speak divine of God theories, no need to be high 
Always exhale the facts cause I don't inhale lye/lie 
Play the greater man's game, to bounce off my losses 
So I can earn the acres  the houses  the horses  
Of course it's much greater than your Benx or your Lex 
The engine to my comprehension is just too complex 
Much too complex, EFX/effects be live like Das 
Making moves down South, to avoid the chaos 
And never, flaunt the coin 'cause dime-getters be gazin 
They call me Luther Van, they say my style is so Amazin 
I'm fazin those who're supposed to have the last laughter 
'Cause even when I'm gone I'm reappearin in the after 
I haveta, send respects to real money makers 
Do not connect us with those champaign sippin money fakers 
Taste the quarter pound with spice from Chi-town 
Now what that prove, you're so full you can't even move 

'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
Well I'm the P-L-you, the G-to-the-One 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
And I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink

Do you want to be a MC? Or do you want to serve 
Do you want to be dope? Or do you want to deal it 
Fabricated acryllic, I feel it, I'm the style molester 
I do a show get Extra P's like the Large Professor 
In fact I get more hoes than Tessa, peep game like a 
Refa-ree in soul control of my 
Desti-ny, in the best of, three out of five 
Whip ANYBODY ass at NBA Live, rappers 
Take a dive like Greg Lougainis with his bitch-ass 
Rather be in Bebe's alley, than at the click with gators 
Not a hater of the players, I'm more like a coach, or an owner 
I Used To Love H.E.R., but now I bone her  
At one point in rhyme I thought I lost my erection 
But then I got it back with the Resurrection, blessings 
Upon rhymes old man who called him traitor 
Big Com Stradamus niggaz styles I predict 

'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
Well I'm the P-L-you, the G-to-the-One 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
And I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win

I sit and think with a drink 

I'm the C-to-the-O, double-M-O-N

And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
And can't no other brother cook these delicacies 
Well I'm the P-L-you, the-G-to-the-One 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 

I'm the most from the coast of the East, then flee 
Droppin more knowledge than litter, on the New York peeve 
It's me, wonder why, in the place to be 
Certified, as superior, MC 
While others explore to make it hardcore 
I make it hard for, wack MC's to even step inside the door 
'Cause these kids is rhyming, sometiming 
And when we get to racing on the mic, they line up to see 
The lyrical killing, with stained egos on the ceiling 
My rhymes escalates like black death rates 
Over music plates, being played as the rule 
Kids thinking stepping to the Soul, you're labelled fools 
Who claims to drop jewels but for now you do the catching 
I don't worry on what crew you run, or what section of earth 
You reside, you're not even a man 
So I don't seem it mandatory taking your pride 
But I will, cause my man said Soul for the life 
You cried "Keepin it real", yet you should try keepin it right 
That's understanding microphone mathematics 
Which leaves the currency in temporary world status 
And when one shows he posed threat to this one 
This one will make that one into none 
Simple equation, zero, you shouldn't play hero 
If you can't stand Strong like the Island I'm from 

'Cause I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
Well I'm the P-L-you, the G-to-the-One 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
And I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
I'm the see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink

Now I'm the P-L-U, the-G-to-the-One 
Walk around the planet earth making money having fun 
Yeah, and I'm the-see-to-the-O, double-M-O-N 
I sit and think with a drink about how I'm gonna win 
And I'm the D-to-the-O, the-V-to-the-E 
And can't another brother cook these delicacies 
See can't another brother cook these delicacies 
See can't another brother cook these delicacies 

Ahh that's how, that's how I'm supposed to do my thing huh 
Like triple it, alright 
That's how we do it, all the way from Strong Island to Chicago 
The type of freestyler flow 
Yeah, it's fluent, and we don't need to flow no more 
Hah

Let me tell you a little something about Soul  
I be a piece of the East coast, so give a toast to 
Plug Wonder why back in the day who soaked his words in jigga 
So when I ran a phrase in June you didn't catch it til December 
I'm a member of them kids from the inner city 
Giving you kitties audible treats, you be aching for making 
More money than a pagan holiday 
Not from the PJ's, yet I still got something to say

We are singing
You this message
Through our music 
Reaching for a, brave and brighter, new tomorrow 
Is the future
We must make it, safe and happy, for the children
Or...or...they will be lost
Or...or...they will be lost

Aiyyo I jump back, put the aim on my shot
It's mandatory, handle glory over with the rock
I'm not a rough guy but a tough guy to beat over drums
No son to this, I'm a rhyme bastard

Some mastered the art of cash, but not the part that lasts
And disappear after doin' two albums
We're not your normal team and we still do ours to fit
Hope inside this, don't define it's
Quits for those who oppose the new
Playin' they've outgrown rap, like a size 5 shoe
Oh they all neo now, alternative touch
Were surprised, no demise for us
We on the rise to bust big, how you fig' we couldn't
Never run out of verbs for you to sip, I told you we wouldn't
I never popped Crist' or popped fists, girl named Chrissie
Was the first, which made it even worse not to miss me

Or... or... they will be lost 
Or... or... they will be lost 

So do you understand it now?  Well try standin' over
Seven box sets, reppin' sixteen years
This rap career ain't work, it's the life in-between
Bedtime 'til the next said time and date
Know the name and salute them dudes
Put the nutrient in rap when they cook them foods
Gotta be like eighteen million heads served
Shit, imagine if there wasn't no us huh?

So I'd like to take the time to shout out the JB's
Next on my list is A Tribe Called Quest
Latifah my Queen, Monie Love, Dres and Mr. Lawnge
Chi-Ali, on your head God bless
Never ring chasin', the permanent tat
In this rap shit, y'all are just temporary lick-ons
Fadin' in the days to come
While the name De La and the legacy built lives on

You little brats

If the meek shall inherit the earth
And not the weak
Let me inherit the street, fuck it
You know what I mean?
I mean I love life man, you know what I mean
Life is beautiful, it's just the shit in it that's fucked up
It's rough but it's fair
People gotta go out there and bust they, bust they ass for a job
I mean, my dad's got five kids, man and I mean yo
He hates drivin' a bus but he loves five kids
You feel me?

I'm a rhyme artist
Out here tryin' to grind my hardest
Up early so to milk the cow
Keep my John Deere out here plowin' the fields
To keep my john hancock's worth up in the now
Went from hangin' on blocks to hangin' on charts
Positions is part of my mission to hangin' on top
Gotta get your polly cracker or with them crackers
And them scheisty ass niggas if you like it or not
I've been rewired to work more efficiently in the dirt
I'm hands on with it all up in my cuticles
Some try to get off the farm but fell into harm
Of getting in the game of those street pharmaceuticals
But, I was raised in those blue collar themes
Havin' white collar dreams cause I see what it means
And though the meek shall inherit the earth but don't forget
The poor are the ones who inherit the debt
You can bet I got better things to do than that
I was a dick who got jerked by Tom and his boys
Came on my land, seized my cattle, and catalog
As if it wouldn't leave me less than coy
But I'm far from bitter even farther from quittin'
Got a grind date to make, no time for sittin'
And playin' Xbox, stand up and exercise my rights
As of by seen of through master's eye
It's the grind date
Know what I'm sayin? I'm sick of askin' that
I mean, the street philosophy is that
I'm gonna milk the cow and cook the meat
At least I'm gonna have some kind of food and drink
Because sometimes you can't come back
Like momma said that if you need 5 cents don't ask for 3
Ask for 10, that's for sure

Yo fuck a rhyme artist, I ain't here for that
I was born with the boom bap, respect the name
My hands on experience was hands on my first contract
Taught me quick how to respect the game
Introduced to the block, got used to the block
But your neighbors be the ones who throw shit on your lawn
It's like every single time we pop, they got annoyed
But we got ahead, and we got along
And puttin' work on the calendars, worse on them calendars
Worth of hump days that broke the camel's back
The grind'll make today look gray
And paint a tainted picture of tomorrows in enamel black
Meet the rhyme, street grind, son whatever the beast
I'm a take it at the horns till the pinky toe torn
And show you why we here this long
Cause when it comes to puttin' in work
Once again it's on

I'm just like everybody else man
An average nigga with above average potential
You know what I mean? I'm not sayin' that I'm a gentleman
I'm saying that I know how to act like a gentleman
In order to get the things that I need
And if I gotta pull out my nickle bag, I'm gonna do that
This ain't no accident, we stayin' here
You damn right I am proud of myself man
And I'm proud of my team man
I don't want you to get the wrong, yo baby on the real?
I don't have sex with people I do business with neither
And that's the real
But I do do business with people that I have sex with
So if there ain't no conflict, let's get this grind on
Cause I'm gonna fuck the shit outta you, that's word

3
That's 
the Magic Number
Yes it is
It's the magic number
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community
Was born 3 Mase, Dove and me
And that's the magic number

Difficult preaching is Posdnuos' pleasure
Pleasure and preaching starts in the heart
Something that stimulates the music in my measure
Measure in my music, raised in three parts
Casually see but don't do like the Soul
'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys
Doin' hip hop hustle, no rock and roll
Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewsters are funky
Parents let go 'cause there's magic in the air
Criticising rap shows you're out of order
Stop look and listen to the phrase Fred Astaires
And don't get offended while Mase do-se-do's your daughter
A tri-camera rolls since our music's now set
Fly rhymes are stored on a D.A.I.S.Y. production
It stands for "Da Inner Sound Y'all" and y'all can bet
That the action's not a trick, but showing the function

Everybody wants to be a deejay
Everybody wants to be an emcee
But being speakers are the best
and you don't have to guess
De La Soul posse consists of three
And that's the magic number

DOVE:

This here piece of the pie 
Is not desser but the course that we dine
And three out of every darn time
The effect is "Mmmm" when a daisy grows in your mind
Showing true position, this here piece is 
Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin'
When that negative number fills up the cavity
Maybe you can subtract it
You can call it your lucky partner
Maybe you can call it your adjective
But odd as it may be
Without my 1 and 2 where would there be
My 3
Mase Pos and Me
And that's the Magic Number

Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds
Common are speakers who are never scrolls
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound
Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug
Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug
Time is a factor so it's time that counts
Count not the negative actions of one
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout
Three forms the soul to a positive sum
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle
Space can be filled if you rise like my lumber
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle
Shake, rattle, roll to my Magic Number

Now you may try to subtract it
But it just won't go away
Three times one?

And that's a Magic Number

Ohhh ohh, ohh OHH ohh ohh
Ohhh ohh, ohh OHH ohh ohh, ohh

Hot times, runnin through ya city
If you miss it now it'll sho' be a pity

Knockin on your radio, like the Crash Crew

Outside of that we pull capers for days
Ridin throughout the maze of street, while we blaze the beat
Watchin the sweet things wiggle they butt

Rippin stages with my thought coalition

Niggaz schemin on my +Girl+ as if my name was +Jesse+
Watch your manners! Now let me pass it off to Dave Banner

Yo, I set travels like Karen LaRue
Small talkin in the big city, it's all about gettin the coins
Everywhere I go I touch a tenderloin
They sportin a dot com Viet marker bomb
on your metro - MARTA order iron horse
Yo take the cross and meet a nigga at the butcher
I'm cuttin your girl - we on a world tour
Supplyin your bloodstream with nothin but the pure uncut, in ya

Hot times, runnin through ya city

I stash a little love when I'm on the visitation
If you crossin my lane, nigga do the same
I guaranteed to run through and prove the game
ain't bigger than the pieces in it
You see the pieces in it had me stuck travellin one side of map
Clappin hands with rap cats who ain't deserve dap
Long hauls and livin out a suitcase man
Chickenheads and gangs of fruitcakes man
Ain't nuttin better than explorin the outskirts
especially when she ain't got no pantyhose on, and it's on

I was walking on the water when I saw a crocodile
He had daisies in his hat, so I stopped him for a while
He delivered me a message, a massage to soothe my stage
What it was was more then plug-up dosage
More than DAISY age
Conversation drew a rule
Which the crowd will roar by millions
Mr. Crocodile said, 'Dove, you must look
For now the villains try to hold you underwater
But one thing we all must heed
Sony Walkmans keep us walking
De La Soul can help you breathe when you tread water'

As I walked along my journey
I thought 'What have I just learned?'
In a flash I saw commotion
There was movement in these ferns
Silently the silence came, was it the end of my world?
I shouted out in fear, 'Who's there?'
'It's me,' said Mr. Squirrel
'I've searched for you all over, now you're found
No time to waste. We must find the Preacher Man
We must find the P.A. Mase, all my population's dying
And we're all in tune to doom
Like the Daisy, I need water
I need chesnuts to consume'
'Mr. Squirrel,' I said, 'I'm sorry
But the problem can't be solved
If there's no one here to help, and no one to get involved
Always look to the positive and never drop your head
For the water will engulf us if we do not dare to tread
So let's tread water'

Now one weary day I woke, my alarm said 'Plug time's up'
Filled my bath up with the water, gargled with my gargle cup
As I bathed I felt a presence, and I'm sort of ticklish
I looked down and then around and I heard
'Hi! I'm Mr Fish. How do you do? As for me
I'm in tip-top shape today, cause my water's clean
And no-one's menu says Fresh Fish Filet
See I look past all my worries, which is something you must do
Though you're fed up, throw your head up
With this advice from me to you
And that's to tread water'

As my day went unexplained, time was finding nothing fun
As I walked along the sidewalk, I heard
'Psst, excuse me, Plug One'
From my Soul, De La that is, I hollered
'Yes, are you talking to me?'
'No alarm meant,' he said, 'Let me introduce myself
I'm Mr Monkey'
'Mr Monkey, I pledge you slap of five
Now how does your problem meet?'
He said, 'My bananas are at their ripest, but they all
Stand at three feet. My swinging hand is bandaged up
Could you help me with this chore?'
I brought him down to the Native shop
And bought him copies of the De La score
Which assisted well in his elevation
Now all bananas is at his grasp
He decided with this accomplished
He would put me on to the path
He to my to live by the Inner Sound, y'all
Which would bring me health in showbiz
Then to use them, not abuse them
And then in the words that got me to 'em
And that is to tread water

 

INTRO 

What's up  world? 

Goin' give you a little love right here 

My man  DJ Honda blessed us with a joint 

Word up  De La up in here  ha 

We goin' to spread a little love 

To some folks who up in my hair right now 

Ah'ight? Check it out 

Verse One 

It was a big deal moving my big wheel to L.I. 

Had a back yard  tho' shit moved slow 

Caught a cat on the humble  wassup  wassup  kid? 

Ya'll be memorizin' flicks of the wild things we did 

We was brick-ball niggas, six small niggas 

And they knew it, and wasn't no-body runnin' through us 

Steppin' in the backyard parties was a blast 

Fucking up our sneakers on the wet grass 

Remember getting stabbed in ya ass? 

Your Moms sat us all down 

Said we was niggas and clowns but it was just love 

And plus love showed me that she was a diamond 

Findin' out God, took a hit me dead on my heart 

And made the eye water start 

But you was strong, can ya hear me Huggy? 

Keep your mind crystal clear when your thought gets muggy 

We them easy street kids from Mr. Bryant's basement 

Wishin' for the Apollo, tryin' to get dough 

Now my time moves slow, ain't it all full circle? 

A dove cry makes the whole scene turn purple 

Remember that night you had to hide in the freezer? 

For real, see them kids were real, we still ?slear? 

But now we grown niggas, and we handling kids 

We been since day one, and the days ain't over 

Gotta share a back seat, push with the chauffer 

My Pops said he's waiting for your ass in the zone 

So we can fly to the land, and welcome you home 

Rob-O see we good to go, you know the rest... 

Don't stress, love-love baby. Ah'ight? 

Chorus 

If you got time to give, I got time to think 

See, it could all change in one eye blink 

While you in the trouble water I hope ya don't sink 

Don't sink, don't sink, don't sink 

Verse Two 

Check it out 

Some rarely saw the negative cause 

From the depths of one's blurred everything's now 

Cleared by laws 

Mad for mere seconds, in the span of dying 

Trying to tell you don't go, I'm about to blow 

No mo' innocence, it's about the dollars 

And events of fame 

Aren't you? Search your name 

From the group? Search your name 

On the dotted line, back before the rhyme I had reasons 

To punch the kid who tried teasin' during lunch 

It was a matter of pro-mo-ting de-cen-cy 

But the 'de' and the 'cy' fell off, so I sinned 

Again and again, until Jesus came down 

Wait, I'm still sinning! I guess he hasn't reached the ground! 

Thoughts of me, before my voice could 

Even recall, couldn't afford the physical peep 

How then was now, but now is not 

Yo, I'm a minute wiser but it seems, kid 

I got some beef, can't take or shake off the wrong 

Accept my apologies to Bob, pass the horn! 

No need for false alarm 

Word up! 

The Nuyopian charm is for show back again 

It's rememberin' the was that is now gone 

For the access of the now so I can move on 

For the access of the now so I, so I 

Chorus x2 

Outro 

G'night world, g'night world 

De La, yo 

My man DJ Honda is on the beat like this 

Don't sink, don't sink, don't sink, don't sink ya'll 

Just letting ya'll into the fleeing moments 

Of the memories of mine 

And about like this, one time, one time

Dave, whattup man?
It's me
Umm.. just callin to see, if possible, if you have any
Time today or within the next couple of days
If, if, you're in the studio.. or if you're at home.. or car, whatever
That song.. that.. it's called trying or something, Mase
Was tellin me that I needed to hear?
He said it was amazing
Whoo.. the way he was talkin.. man I want to hear it!

Am I just another lost in the pack?
We for shack ship, you know laugh it off
Years just blow by
My eyes stay fixed but the picture's kinda outta focus
I cry a lot but admit to it
Enjoyin life now but I've been through it
Sometimes I wish that I can go back
No bills no kids just getting tore back
I want a wife, I love women
How could I front like I don't be in love wit em?
A li'l man that I can teach
A li'l sand but not the beach
I figure excess'll only bring an excessive amount of fussin
So when I'm gone, make sure the head stone reads, 'He did it for us'
I'm like your modern day Jesus
I cherish warm thoughts like a gray goose
And float soft kisses to my baby

Yeah, respect her for that
She gon be somebody
Instead of somebody-baby-mama
You see young minds are now made of armor
I'm tryin to pop a hole in your Yankee cap
Absorb me
The skies over your head ain't safe no more
And Hip Hop ain't your own
And if it is then you fuckin up the crib son
You make life look like I don't want to live one
You might as well hold your breath until you die in a
Corner somewhere bent over in the crevice
This God Theory overcomes the worst of weathers
As long as you willin to try, you on a good start homie
.. you on a good start.. see nigga tryin

 People are you ready?
 Yes we're ready!

Are you really ready?
We want to be ready!

Ready for the change that may approach you?
Yes!

Follow down the path that you supposed to?
Yes!

People are you ready?
Yes we're ready! 

Are you really ready to try?
We want to try harder!

You know mistakes are trials that we learn from?
Yes!
I order to live life, you must earn one?
Yes!

People are you ready?

Throughout my change to grow, Some of my people got left behind
They didn't listen for the gun, as I leaped from off the line
Thirteen years deep in this marathon I'm runnin
Paid dues and still got bills to pay
When I came back around the way
Old friends gave me dead eyes
And fake smiles, half wide
We were supposed to rid the world of danger
These days we nod heads and small talk like polite strangers
It's natural to fall off, just land close to the tree
I'll be there if they need me to be
And I know all my local shorties
'cause they all know who I am
And latey want to flip grammar instead of grams 
Like that's the only choice they got
They tell me how they gonna shake up the game
But came to me to see if I could give em guidance for change
Shit why'all, I need guidance myself
And I chisel right words to make gems
Got fans around the world, but my girl's no one of em
And my relationship's a big question
'cause my career's a clear hindrance to her progression
Said she needs a man and our kids need a father
I'm not at all ready to hear her say don't bother
And break
And this I know I can't take
But uhh
C. Smith said to hold on
My brother Luck said to hold on
My nigga Dave said to hold on
My nigga Mase said to hold on
Yo, Maseo, we need to hold on
Eh, yo, why'all we need to hold on

 People are you ready?
 Yes we're ready!

Well, what you want to be?
We want to be ready!

Do you want to lose hate for love?
Yes!

Do you want to see these gates above?
Yes!

I said people are you ready?
Yes we're ready!

But are you willing to try?
We want to try harder!

Do you really want to carry some weight?
Yes!

Are you ready to design your fate?
Yes!

Yo, people are you ready?
Yes we're ready!

Well what you want to be?
We want to be ready!..

Operation complete. Preparing for.. Installment three

Come on, Come on, bounce - bounce
Come on... bounce, rock, roll

You can do, whatever you want
Whatever you like
It's your own life
So let me be, to do what I want
To do what I like
'Cause this is my life

It's been about ten long years, my skin wreaks
flavors that your incense couldn't match
We burn slow like syphillis in your piss, accommodated
with the penicillin, you're listenin', to

This "Art Official" will keep your shoes moonwalkin
Soon to talk about, "Pop Music"
You'll buy it cause you choose it
A lot of MC's is really S&M'n

Whips and chains, I maintain like a old jazz singer
Elephants in any location
Held back in rotation, an apple a day
only makes a nigga fruity

I eat responsibilities to carry out my duty
 in the MD's, I pull it out just to polish it
Make notes if you earnin' or wait your turnbuckle
I stick to gettin' mines like stucco 

I'm that full-time rapper, the nickname's Llama
Part-time father if you ask my daughter's mommas
Missin' in action cause the action got a fraction
of the world listenin' to me

Got em travellin' overseas in lands constantly
Got a sea of hands wavin', ain't misbehavin'
but a lot of kids cravin' for somethin' they ain't got
Like the keys to the ride and a pocket with a knot and it's

Holdin' they ground 'til they rot in it
Plottin' it, lockin' it down strong
'Cause it's nuttin' wrong gettin' your bubblin' on sticker
But too much bubblin' can make you fizz quicker

So watch your stack, keep your fam intact
and pay attention to the now, I'm clearin' the mess
While they stressin' back in the day, I'm at the front of the night
with my crew shinin' light on the 

Now we on top of this like a typical bed position
Peepin' your view, got your whole crew wishin' and waitin'
Makin' dollars out of ten dime pieces
who be sippin out the glass suckin' on the lime pieces included

In my pieces I pen the good livin'
And even when we're stressin' from in the hood livin'
at least we're livin' and there ain't no hell in that
Give me a yell in that, and go 

I want to see the world ten times over
Dive off cliffs and land on oppotunities unthinkable
You sinkin straight to the bottom; while I float in parades
that St. Patty couldn't put up

All my niggaz tryin to build, then throw your wood up
Design life like PNB gears so stand clear for the blast off
Last off my chest, peace to Dav West
Live your life to the fullest 

You can do.. what you want.. what you like
Let me be.. what I want.. what I like

Come on, Come on, bounce - bounce
Come on... bounce, rock, roll

You can do, whatever you want
Whatever you like
It's your own life

Fact of the matter my style will never fade
Managin to keep it all A-grade
So you can stay nourish and flourish with the truth

Gettin shock treated by the crossfire
Ha-siyahh, burn bare well prepared
To make my decision for my livin
I ain't the one +Robin+ I'm the one +Given+
Hip-Hop driven, and willin to die for it
When Scott LaRock died man I cried and shit
Then some cats got rich callin a woman a bitch
But ain't no woman like the one I got
And if you call her a bitch well you might get 
And I know the feelings is mutual
It's uncivilized and unsuitable
Crips and bloods are recruitable

You don't wanna bust dat shit

So WHAT? Tell me, WHAT?

"You out there?  Louder!
Well clap your hands to what he's doing
On tempo Jack"

NYC gave you the ball, so how you gonna hate us?
We creators of them East coast stars
If you ask me I'll tell you there's no comp
But I'm still humble, even though I will crumble halls
Some call 'em songs, I call 'em words from me
that take long to cook
So some feel free in saying that we don't hunger for beats
Not that we not hungry, just picky in what we eat
Keep food off the mind and keep weight off the body
All you gotta do is keep my name out your mouth
And stop frowning like you hostile
You know that it's a booger rubbing up against your nostril
Nigga how you figure you can play this rap game without the backbone?
It's Maseo, Dave, Wonder Why, giving what you lack holmes

Hey yo prepare yourself for the Neutron, bitch!
This is eighty-six, let that neo-rap go
We present these flares to put fire to your ears
to lay smoke like rusty exhaust pipes
We run mics, let Sean run the marathon
Yo raise that money son, we raisin these kids
Get claps when curtains close, stage left
Up your stamina baby, bring some breath
SAT book smart, part ese
Loc'in like Tone, street niggas get grown
Acquire more couth before you get poofed
Or get some shells sent over to your mic booth
Excuse, my delivery, but when peace don't work
see this piece goin' work, cock aim and shoot!
It's my constitutional right to bear arms
Arms and bare hands on mics, make fans unite
Woodstock and white folks involved
Black man get on yo' job!

"Well clap your hands to what he's doing
On tempo Jack"

Let's go beat for beat, and rhymes for rhymes

Just bring your beats, and bring your rhymes

The heavyweight L.I. brother with no date, of expiration
On this fate on the mic, them birthday keep coming
I'm hated on by niggas I love most
So what threat could you possibly pose when I'm on your coast?
So raise your guns or your glasses
Either way there'll be a toast in the air
Markin the return of bare minimums you need to learn
Get your verbs right when you down to clap

See that gun powder caliber rap'll tip hats like gentlemen do
Smash tenements and skyscrapers
Bow-tie papers stacked high
Pay the resident tax or get your street sweeped
Front row, backstage or the cheap seats
I "Dodge" ricochets like "Ram" trucks, you slow poke to pull it
And I sup-pose you want to top the Billboard chart
Man I toast these rhymes and then pop like Pop-Tarts

"Well clap your hands to what he's doing"

Yo... we bout to get it  get it  
get it  get on down  down 
Yo! We 'bout to get it  get it  
get it  get on down  down 
Yo! 

We run it, Hot! When we over the drums
To the, Top! Cause the bottom we're from
We got the, Drop! On your weekend crew
'Cause you're full-time talkin' while we peepin' your view

Rahubat, you know my name
I run my humbleness with fame
God-body, nuttin' plain
While you claimin' shepherd that you heard this
You, heard this on day first
Watch my man, he'll make it worse
Ain't no new click, we still Native

Clothes knit, stitched tight, related
that's the way we handle it
Pin us up or mantle it
We on fire you candle lit
Daydreamin', on a rack
Get bought worn and brought back
We sport rhyme thought real tight

To gain sizes much bigger
Life life well, get mail filled with
Checks from sales we deliver

Spend a little, make a little
I want it big like white boy wallets
Credit delivered, Fed-Excellent
To my dot com, we on the web like Charlotte's
Hornet, back her up, she too much on it
Your plastic ass'll get swiped
Past the limit see you the type
To get yo' cosmetics smeared on pillows all night

While we peepin' your view
While we, peepin' your view
We got they eyes on lock
Let them flock to your wit while I spit after you

Look ma, I'm still rhymin'
Baby boy still providin'
Breakin' bread in four states
Makin' these struggles get gone

Private eyes, I see why'all spyin'
You watch while I clock
Fertilize my brain data
Makin' accounts grow green like the front lawns

Yo I may be old school
But I'm not no old fool
Heard out your mouth words flee
'Bout 'These niggaz ain't nice'
You just barbershop talkin'
While we round the world walkin'
be	, you ain't D.M.C.
You slip and fall on my ice
No lyin', straight shinin'
I give you supper from my upper diamond
You got limbs so climb in

Yo, soak up what you find-in
We too pure for you to try
You sniffin' maybe's and if's

And if 'if' was a spliff
Man we'd all be hiiigh-iiigh.. iiiggghhh..

.. But it's not, so sober up
You flashin' out like you paparaz'
You'll need to take a liver shot
To feel the heat on how we runnin' it, yo

'Cause you're full time talkin' while we, while we
While we lettin' you know I'm in a
Certified rhyme meadow for days
If you ask Mercenary bout this shit, it pays
Hitting Willie Mays style out the park
Mastering in this +Art+ that's +Official+
Your ears absorb this like tears, on a tissue
'Cause my thoughts are dollar bill crisp
Distinct like E-Double's lisp
L.I. alumni, wonder why I got it
Got it? Get a piece
Got product that you all should own and not lease
Some say drummers play synonymous with ill
With wordplay, that keep us all paid like a bill
We're the parent company
You the sub in my d-i-vision
You don't know how...

1- * Speaking Spanish *
WATCH OUT!
* Speaking Spanish *
WATCH OUT!
* Speaking Spanish *
WATCH OUT!
* Speaking Spanish*

Get up and do the biz, our style is the wild
Hit you with a spell whether Jew or gen-tile
When you enterin' the realm
You find me at the helm
Still standin' like abandoned buildings
In the southern part of BX, can old school it like a T-Rex
Ya well advanced connect dance with thoughts
Deep like Barry White's throat box
I bet you those cops mix
Double high tower my power grants me the chicks
The blows the cars and enemies that want to spar
You want to see it no matter who you are
Yeah I'm bound to ground you like that
Put they ass on a mound and introduce em' to a baseball
Face tall, brag about it like teenage sex
Text book characters gettin' etched out to rough draft
Rush Limbaugh autograph her left titty
New Yor, New York yeah we bigger than the buildings
Do it for the love of the art and the children's
And throw paper machet inside of ya models
See we all throttles, we zip by in this drive
Allergic to ya sperm broke hives
Concerned about ya ;ife when ya down eight lives
Top of the night I'm up in queens like ah yeah

Introducin' introducin' to you Dave
Batter on deck, carded every time I set foot in the joint
Cabaret artist I'll two piece ya tray
If she want to get vamped, bring her to the tent
Touch her till her back indents
Wrap it extra strength
Run a lap on her calculatin' the length
Holdin' mics tighter than hymens

Old school it like Holly-Hobby, Head-to-Head, Easy Bake Oven
Strong Jerome lovin' man I hit the pack
Panther power keep it all relative to the sixties
Bill Bixby green, ATM money
Got my pockets lookin' like I'm rockin' Popeye jeans
Classic like Reuben and Rah
One nigga under the groove we shootin' for that Parliament high
Plus bigger than the fourth of July
Take the back seat drive out
Hey yo, hey yo ain't nothin' street about me more like a light post
Sinin' above all who are why'all to boast
Stayed calm and all came to me to host
My vocab grabs many, long to cultivate raps
It's gettin' filled moms jack penny
It used to be unknown around the way
Now my bix became a bouqet
Every nose in it, fillin' up seats like a session in a Senate
Been a minute since ya heard the souls
So the soul gon' cost ya three
All ya people want to front like the soul don't hold control
But it don't mean shit to me
Plain to see that a song like this been what ya all missed
Come on, genuine adrenaline from off the wrists
We run the interference throughout the game clout
Can't be denied the bout for the title
Throw up ya guns and hold the pose like an idol
Bring it back to the draw
Ghosts of grand wiz Theodore
Played dirty with ever since played on the floor
Stop verbal assaults just in case a war break out
Steal vaults bigger than giraffes
But they still got a lot for me
Heard em' say a lot of nigga with the underground
They'd die for the underground but ain't makin' no money
Stupid

Took spanish one for four years, just so you know
Spit my shit right here

Oigame, malo muchacho
Mos Def con Tony Flaco, el idioma que yo hablo
Pretty young champ like Camacho, spittin the hot flow
B-Boy shout, Zulu gestapo, bro
You know my stilo, cigarrillo con tamarindo
Habichuelas negras, arroz amarillo
Yo soy suave viejito, campeon nacional como Tito
Bringin the heat bro, unique when I speak yo
Doin my Way like Carlito, beats by M-A-S-E-O
From Panama to Puerto Rico, play my jam on Caliente noventa y siete
On the expressway, and press play, see what ya neck say
Duro siempre, para mi gente, ganamos
Se acabo venga vamos, corillo, alcen las manos
Blowin ya spot like I got toast
A lotta MC's is Def, but they not Mos, and not close
Understand it when I shine, all your light is through
Ya niggas wack in one language, I'm nice in two, fuck is you

Que eso? Tu no sabe mi sonido
Siempre ganamos, nunca perdimos
Para quien? Blanco, Negro, Latino
Del mundo, cuando junto, que profundo
Que eso? Tu no sabe mi sonido
Siempre ganamos, nunca perdimos
Para quien? Blanco, Negro, Latino
Corillo, so my street folk come unidos

I got chips, to Ziploc grips to burst
Non-conventional, original B-Boy, my peeps call me Merc'
I'm from N.Y.C., so see why in me
There's a lot of hustlin', found around my cheek
Sippin' strawberry daq, that ain't never been fucked
Try to catch me off balance, man, you shit outta luck
Cause we got more rams, and I drivin' y'all
Got the people like the jams, more live than y'all
I'm wit Tone Touch, while ya all touched in the head
Such a lethal combination, got you facin' the red
And um, yo, you don't want no parts in that
You style so pussy, last name should be Cat
We takin it back, like flea stacks and pylons
Wit the ladies in a frenzy, runnin' they nylon
Reveal flesh to test, cause I love bruisin' 'em
Treat my battles like my children nigga, I'm never losin' 'em

Aiyo, what's that? You don't know, that's my sound yo
No one can rock it like this, we put it down yo
For who? Black, white, purple or brown yo
It's Mos, De La, and Touch, we hold the crown yo
Pero what's that? You don't know, that's my sound yo
No one can rock it like this, we put it down yo
For who? Black, white, purple or brown yo
So all my street folk come on gather round yo

Pardon me son, but the only Spanish I knew, was dame un beso
Cut bitches wit niggas, who nettin' the peso
Ya breathin' on beats like this, if you say so
I stay sippin' on God theories, so where the case yo?
Wait flow on four floors like film edits
Fuck sayin' the name, you read it in the credits
Sit that ass down on my lyrics
We servin' niggas up some beans and rice, everything is everything
Heavy metal thing, rock, wit Mos and Pos and us
Written flows get broke down by the comas
From L.I. lawn, I green shit up in my wallets
To fly the wrong places, and get red like scarlet
How I dollar it, I just earn the say
So when the itchy itchy come, I satisfy the crave
And let it fall a little too much
I let Tone touch my ears to let the bullshit disappear

Pa' 'fuera, tu no sabe, mi manera
Native tongue, puttin' it down, donde quiera
De La, Mos Def wit a candela
Borinquen, que bonita bandera
Respect the architect or be next to catch a pela
I send ya all runnin' home to your abuela
Cash rap over a beat or acapella
Kick a wicked rhyme like a fortune teller
This fella, se pone feo quando llego
I still be shoutin' out cats in San Diego
I'm still in effect, and I'm still doin the huevo
I still be putting it down, till I'm a viejo
Man, you can't tell me nothin' about the juego
I told ya suckas before, leggo my eggo
Yet you insist upon playin' wit fuego
But I catch you on the rebound, hasta luego, pendejo

Aha! What a beautiful day in the concrete jungle
I think I'll go down to Goliath and just be a fuckin' dickhead!
Damn, I feel good today
I'm looking forward to going and just beating
the shit out of someone and taking their money
What a fucking great job I have!

I wonder why I feel so good. Could it be the music?
Could it be my breakfast? Or could it just be the fact that
I just hate everybody, dammit!
Life is grand, life is great, I'll get myself a real cheap date
Some woman I can take to McDonalds, spend a dollar twenty-five on

And have like, the best time of your life with afterwards
Life is too good to believe sometimes
But we all can't have it the way I do, so to all you suckers out there
Kiss off. All right? Bye bye!

Dance with me, come on dance - with me baby
Dance with me, come on dance - with me baby
Dance with me, come on dance - with me baby
Dance with me, come on dance - with me baby

How you goin' tell me to mind my own biz
When you lookin like somethin I need to know about?
I used to go about it the wrong way, tuggin your arm when you'd pass
But I see you got class besides all that

Yeah I'm picky in my own way too
While the rest of these fools is lookin to screw your brains out
I blinged out don't want to stand froze
Practicin my hello's, hey lady, how you doin

Renewin these vows is like fifty steps beyond from here
Shit I don't even know your name yet 
Ain't sure what your character contains yet
But damn lady, you could be my Valentine

Cupid got his infrared on my chest clocked
Let the rest flock, they just birds anyway
I grow my confidence in words the Henny way - yeah, buy me a drink
So we can sink into that thought path..

Now you know you ain't right, eyein' me up all night
Despite the fact some kid is runnin' chitta-chat in your ear
How the hell we get here, with me over here, and you over there
When we can make, such an obvious pair?
Why miss? Have you misread my shyness for conceit?
I'm peepin' how you move it to the pace of the beat

Got my eyes on wide as they constantly collide with yours
Your heavenly body rushin' the tide to shore
Your heavenly body rushin' these guys to the floor
To find pleasure in your double digit design, 

But these clowns look hurt
And as a woman's ex-nigga I'm a woman ex-pert
Understandin' how the ovaries and all that shit work
Extremely dreamy, my eyes you look surprised

That I'm movin' closer - don't be, I'm supposed to D.C.
Are you for real or a tease?

Now let that drink set in sweet, we up close and personal
Ain't nuttin dull about this, sharp like Swiss precision
 my every move from the door
Teran escortin us to V.I.P., we live in D.C.

Shoestring dress I want to fuck and make your hair look a mess
Suckin the straw huh? You know the head game
First place chick girl I'm all about winnin too
I want my trophy life-sized in a see through

This ain't your average, whippin your batterage
Drivin song that probably isn't your type
So I type it long with that ink that won't budge
Or smudge off your memory; courtesy of SkyTel

My mail, pop up like some bubbles found on VH-1
Also need the math to your color pH-1
Not the old man in the club who needs his dub to get rubbed
But sound the buzzer, I'm comin to sub

 
 
I want to be a supa emcee 
 so let me step up to bat 
Attack a hit to go beyond this age of rap counterfeits 
Out of the heavens August one seven  sixty nine 
Born I  wonder why with the thoughts to rhyme 
Til there was no longer thoughts to dream 
When an unpolished demo led to limos at the age of eighteen 
Accompanied by the screams, Plug One 
Shot up with fame like novacaine it made me numb 
So numb I wouldn't been able to feel 
Niggaz diggin in my pockets for my currency reels 
But still, I make girls brown eyes blue at will  
My ass was no longer mass appeal 
Oh shit, I guess that was all the fame I was alloted 
Wait a minite, new video, like a leopard I'm spotted 
In a night club chillin with Kamaal and Phife 
I be that farmer cultivating owning acres of mics 
And I likes to make it known Strong Island stylin 
For a while, so do that dance 
 Yes I be 
 Yes I be 
 Yes I be 
That's my job as a supa emcee, I'm from Long Isle 
Mobile, make it worth your while 
If the jam needs motion I'm the one to dial 
 Yes I be 
 Yes, yes I be  
I can stress the makin of loot to feed the fam 
While the voices impersonate the true who I am 
Buzzin in my ear, oh you one of those wannabees 
Always buzzin in my ear you down with supa emcees 
Steppin to me with your pleas that you gots, butter rhymes 
Man the only thing butter bout you is your spine 
Mad yellow, you can't rock the Mardi Gras, my mellow 
Cause my stealth show more than knowledge of self 
I got knowlegde of you, to know you a wack em-crew 
 Nah, a wack em-crew, see you a crew of wack 
Niggaz 
You should have never tried to test 
These words that I Man, with the eye/I to Fest 
While you sayin one thing really meaning the next 
You're just a contra-DICK, your mind's been tampered WITH 

Like some holy boooks, but looks to the sky 
Cause Wonder Why's here to save the day 
 Yes I be 
 Yes I be 
 Yes I be 
Cause ultimately, I'm lettin all MC's know that 
What's the name of this crew?  
Well alright, and what be the dish we servin? 
 Posdanos help the next get loose 
Like an alcohol scenario rap be on the rocks 
Authenticity that missin fee to pay to join the flock of MC 

These niggaz stand lower than knees 
Dramatized in they eyes as the ones to please 
When rap kids apply violent pressure to father, brother and son 
For fun to say they inflict pain 
R&B niggaz lie to mother, sister, and daughter 
To have sex disguised as lovin in the rain 
Their words are more hallow than October 31st 
What's worse, hate to see the females 
Switch to sexual mentality, it doesn't match with they given anatomy 
Man they rather be hoes like that male emcee 
Who walk around like they got nuts 
And use the tits and ass like a crutch 
Man the underground's about not bein exposed 
So you better take you naked ass and put on some clothes 
Man this be goin out to the kids from east smash  
Amityville  
To all my people out in whinedance, bayshore  
C.I.'s in the place  
Brinkwood, hempstead, all my  
Brothers out in roosevelt, freeport  
Uniondale to long beach  
To them girls out in huntington  
Long island for real 

We've just played fifteen minutes of commercial free music
Of course you're listening to wrms fm, and we
Play nothing but de la slow music
We're coming up on the hour of ten
O'clock, it's a full moon, and perfect night
For lovers we're about to do something we don't usually do, and
That's we'll I'll show you

Hello, hello, who's this?

Squirrel

Hi! listen, I don't have a lot of time, my name's mizuna, I'm
On my dinner break from burger king and I just
Called to tell you that I love your new radio station, I love
Everything you guys do

Thank you and with that, the next song is just
For you and when you go back tell all the burger king
Honeys that if they want to call and talk to me, just call
Wrms see ya

If it's not De La Slow  then it's not WRMS. Where Cat's in control  
twisting and tuning until you're purr fectly content. Special cat 
call goes out to the suckers at the donut shop. Thanks for serving it 
to me dark  hot  and no caffiene. Snuggle tight and hang loose 
boys  it's time to groove to a De La Slow move on WRMS.

I woke up in the darkness at twelve seventeen, to shots and sirenes
Look out the window, peep the high beams
Now, they searchin', the cops lookin' for the person
That pulled the trigga

Medical figures is nursin' the kid that got shot
Some innocent ak, that would front
To flip the rock on them, at King Street block
I tried to tell him to stop 'cuz yo, it's ghetto red hot

Similar to the blood, now floodin' his top
I take a step out the spot, to the point of attack
And see the shorty, wop heart blast, out his back
Damn, I'm thinkin', it don't cease, it's no more peace

Police level increase but what the fuck
It's still crime on the streets
I can't breathe, now what's goin' on?
One minute you alive, the next, you're gone

Illadel P H I A, hell
Bust off into the heavens, for the nigga, who fell
And hit the L, for the niggaz, who fell
When that could have been prevented

In front of the flat, your moms rented
And no one expect that from you, 'cuz you was timid
Fuckin' with them, cats from outside city limits
Funny, how this whole thing changed, an off minute

Yo, dig it, panic
None of this is ever granted
Drownin' in a nightmare, stranded

One one one one two
P-P-5-D
Yeah, yeah, P-P-5-D
I'm sayin, yo
Touch this yo, knahmsayin what?
Yo-yo, yo, 100%

Yo! On these seventy-three keys, of ivory and ebony
I swear solemnly that I'll forever rock steadily
People want to know where Malik? He right next to me
The weaponry, the secret recipe
Hard to peep this, deep shit, shows I eat with
Contaminated thoughts I walk the street with
I bayonet cassettes and chop beats with
This olympic lyricism you can't, compete with
Globe travelin', throwin' your verse like a javelin
Things Fall Apart and MC's unravelin'
Backstage whisperin' to management like
"Change the order, it's no way that we can rock after them"
My man sport the 'fro like 'What's Happenin?'
From the latest hi-atus, The Roots back again
Your crew practicin' to catch this natural blend
They packages read "care when handlin'"
It's all soft shit, batteries not included with
Matter of fact, your whole front's a re-enactment
I blow your ba-tty ass into fragments, P-5-D
The new testament, mic specialist, what?

Yeah
Check it out, yo
Yo yo, Black Thought, I represent the Fifth Dynasty
Lyrical click, 100% Dundee

Malik B, I represent the P-5-D
Guerilla click, 100% Dundee

Black Thought, I represent the Fifth Dynasty
Lyrical click, 100% Dundee

Malik B, I represent the P-5-D
Guerilla click, 100% Dundee

The Milli-illitant-tant, 'pon cock, ready to rock
Power out, in the clout, it seems out, all through your block
Posse don't play the cut, but what, you get sheist
Got the personality named trife, ready to heist
Smashin 'graphs, snatch the ice, crush your mental device
Thought twice, shoulda thought once, got played for the dunce
Dialogues I moderate, cool out, we outta state
Just blendin' in the great, give me room to ventilate
Most niggaz is fraudulent, the rap sergeant
Bargin', through your regiment, call your president
Hittin' all targets 'cause it's a cause that's lost
Between the killers when they probably Teddy Ruxpin talk
Droppin' tears of steel, two drops up in the bucket
Facin' three ? and a cop so yo fuck it
If I get abducted, trapped up in the belly
Wacked up my celly, get known like Dawn Stanley
You know the deally on the daily in the ?
If I sense you got a bend to your kite, then send it up
We press up on your corner with windows they're tinted up
Lay our props face down on the ground and get it up, what?
Face on the ground and get it up

Yo yo, Black Thought, I represent the Fifth Dynasty

While you pose for pictures, I'm the invisible enigma
Down low, scope you off the roof like the fiddler
Cage you up in the vocal booth, you're held prisoner
Watch, while I'm bangin' out this hot shit from Sigma
Illa-del-P-A, live without a DJ
And it's been that way, since Sergio Vallente
Yo, The Roots holdin' it down, is all you can say
Plus the Black Thought em-cey, professional-lay
Push pen to paper like Chinua Achebe
Thumpin', what was your assumption
I lace your function, make it a Black Thought production
Word up I'm on somethin', stellar hold off course
I'm gone bluntin', travel light and broadcast
Via satellite, Illa-Fifth Dynamite
Lyrically calculus in this arithmetic hip-hop metropolis
But loyal fiends coppin this hot shit
Yaknahmsayin? Hot shit, word up
Illa-Fifth hot shit y'all

I'm from the land of them straight razor face beard niggas
With hammers on their waist, yeah, waste rare niggas
And I race scared niggas, them snake head niggas
That take care of niggas who don't break bread with us
Niggas make dead niggas and hate black niggas
Brown niggas high yellow niggas and them red niggas
No telling when the bullet coming, be prepared niggas
Cause when it do it coming land, sea and air niggas
That's everywhere niggas, Am I the motherfucking legendary?
Yeah niggas, make it very clear niggas
Been looking at y'all in my rearview
Mirror niggas want to be a millionaire, I'm already there niggas
I'm the definiere nigga, a bear taking more than my share
Lookee here, yeah, I know it ain't fair nigga
Neither is a bar even with a hair trigger
Haystack, try and find a needle up in there nigga
Leave you up in there nigga, show me the puppet
That don't need a puppeteer nigga, shed another tear nigga
I'm in the field with a shield and a spear nigga
I'm in your girl with her heels in the air nigga
I am such a fair nigga, you in a battle telling
Me you not ready like you figured I'ma bear with you
I don't care nigga, you now listening to the sounds
Of the money making jam trillionaires nigga
Gentlemen of an extraordinary league
You never see me blowing on no ordinary weed
What I'm smoking ain't a product of no ordinary seed
Your boy is heavy treed, I'm feeling merry
As a Tyler Perry scene, that monetary gang green
We tried to launder the cash and never came clean
So now I'm in the story with all the cats before me
And smoke purgatory for doing the same thing
And them niggas ain't change, them niggas can't change
Their moms shake their heads saying it's such a dang shame
The train to the buck, did another dang plan
My stage and my government ain't the same name
I'm a rock star, love it that my wallet chain hang
I'm a modern day saint, I'm a modern day kane
My definition I can finally explain
Cold smooth like that dude Sean Connery was playing
I just got to be the man, I'm the father figure and
When I spit it's something like a psychology exam
If you stand where I stood, you could probably understand
How that mic feeling like a million dollars in my hand
It's the silence of the lamb, go and cop another gram
And twist with your zanny, work your set, work it down
What's your net working plan? You better look alive
Cuz them niggas outside looking desperate again nigga
And the blunts and liquor killing our lungs and liver
The asthmatic drug addict I function with it
I put a rapper in a hole where the dust will sit
For spitting played out patterns that once was hitting
I got news for you all, let me show you how to ball
See the legendary fall? I ain't heard of that
Y'all niggas is off the wall like Aresnio Hall
I'ma put you right back where the dirt is at
450 Fahrenheit on the thermostat
Somebody starving like a white girl runnin' that
But she not a earner yet, she couldn't put in no work,
Not earning that, the black microphone murder vet
I'm in a class of my own,
If I got beef with you, you the last one to know
I arrive on time, I'm never fashionable
You late, I'm already international-able
I done toured to Berlin, banged in Beijing
You never seen nothing can't say the same thing
Tell somebody Black Thought, yeah you know the name ring
So give him the game ring for bringing what them niggas can't bring
My hustle is long, my muscle is strong
My man put the paper in the duffel I'm gone
Y'all still a light year from the level I'm on
Just a pawn stepping right into the head of the storm
You been warned, I will blow y'all niggas and disintegrate
I'm a rebel, renegade must stay paid

Come on we gonna do it like something like this baby
Break it on on down
Come on

"Noise"

Where you at?

The name of the brother to blame
It's quite plain, it's not the rain
But a brother who don't claim or aim
To be a preacher or ordained
I have Black Thoughts, therefore my name's the same

Don't question my ability, in a studio facility
As I utilize my God-given utility
On time, I get behind and push along a rhyme of mine
Which I design, with what? The mind

Leave MC's blind with amnesia
Chop 'em into salad and my name ain't Caesar
Think twice before you approach
Get benched by the coach like exit post

I wrote murder, so you can say it's Murder He Wrote
You think I'm Hell sent, so you repent to the Pope
Don't walk when the sign says not to
And don't talk when Black Thought's about to

When I say, ?Maestro? and bro starts to play it
If you got a rhyme in your mind, then don't say it
Save it for the weaker, pack your portable speaker
And utilize the treads on your sneaker

Take your sorry crew back an' forget about rappin'
Forget you ever saw me and forget this ever happened
'Cause you might have nightmares of MCs bein' slain
And I'll be to blame when you go insane

Yeah yeah yeah, yes I, no doubt yes I 
Check it out, yo yo
Areegato, to all my people in Japan
Whether you rockin Cartier or Pierre Cardan
I'm barging in like excuse, I beg your pardon
To crush carbon copy MC's wit clone jargon
Move the crowd to leave the microphone sparkin
Leave you caught inside the lines of my page beneath the margin
Now we could mud-sling to cease the foul-talkin
I personally would rather keep things peace, but it's your option
I hit the block wit hip-hop, it's like oxen
Stampede wit lyrical heavyweight boxing
Yo, just give thanks it's the new shit
For y'all to ever try to sleep on this is stupid
My thought's deep like the upright acustic
Bass, Cold Crush like Charlie Chase
To keep the ladies grindin like a slow jam
You just a slow-jam fizz kid, get wit the program
My style hundred proof, I pause for no man
The Fifth Dy-nas-ty, that's the slogan
From S-P to West-P to Logan
The planet is a parachute, I got em open

Aiyyo I'm out there, aiyyo I'm still out there
Worldwide yo I'm still out there, Roots Crew forever out there
Aiyyo I'm out there, SP to the, out there

C'mon, yo I'm out there, aiyyo I'm still out there
Roots crew to the to the to the to the

Y'all know the name, I got game like an Evangelist
Relax to my man D'Angel-ist, who could ever cancel this
Music growth, it's cancerous not glamorous
Yo the lifestyle I embrace to some scandalous
I chop joke MC's like choke sandwiches
And backslap the snare drum open-handed wit my vo-cal
So I'm far from lo-cal
My peoples got to keep me in they fo-cal
Perform Al Jerome style, then act like you know now 
Surf the internet, inspect my profile
Return to menu if you miss this
Your girlfriend said my music is futuristic

Then kissed me on my neck, left marks of lipstick
Then came to the spot and we got lifted
I rip shit on the solo unassisted
Or wit Malik and the Fifth Click, so y'all should keep your lips zipped
Y'all don't know what it's about, get on route
I hold it down wit no doubt and sip Stout
And got the hot record out
Y'all need to let your necks snap back, check it out, word up

Yo I'm out there, aiyyo I'm still out there

S-P to the, to the to the to the

Aiyyo so what's the Fifth then? The Million Dollar Question
We veterans, lyrically threatening freshmen
Y'all lookin at next year, I see the next ten
And front on me strategically, plan positioning
Out there, steppin into your world I'm visitin
Discography time less you keep listenin
Within the crevices these clones is missing in
Action, mysterious magnetic attraction wit that thing
My melody like Nat King, and MC's is so un-inter-esting
Forever givin y'all the next best thing
I give it to you like pink champelle and ink bing
I drink Yuengling, JaRoots and Ginseng
You testin me, ock? yo what was you thinkin

A delivery that you're forever remembering

Hip-Hop, you the love of my life, of my life

The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
Into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back, the first five rows
But before the raw live shows
I remember I's a little snot-nosed
Rocking Cazal goggles and Izod clothes
Learning the ropes of ghetto survival
Peeping out the situation I had to slide through
Had to watch my back, my front, plus my sides too
When it came to getting mine I ain't trying, to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you
Hip-hop, you the love of my life and that's true
When I was handling the shit I had to do
It was all for you, from the door for you
Speak through you, getting paper on tour for you
From the start, Thought was down by law for you
Used to hit up every corner store wall for you
We ripped shit and kept it hardcore for you
I remember late nights, steady rocking the mic
Hip-hop you the love of my life
So tell the people like that y'all
And it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We bout to take it to the top

I was speaking, to my guy 'Riq and
How she was desperately seeking to Organize in a Konfusion
Using no protection, told H.E.R. on Resurrection
Caught up in the Hype Williams, and lost H.E.R. direction
Getting ate in sections where I wouldn't eat H.E.R
An under the counter love, so silently I treat H.E.R
Her Daddy'll beat H.E.R., eyes all Puff-ed
In the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff
When we touch, it was more than just a fuck
The Police
In H.E.R. I found peace
Like Malcolm in the East
Seen H.E.R. on the streets of New York, tricking off
Tried to make a hit with H.E.R. but my dick went soft
Movin weight, losing weight
Not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty
Most of the niggas she know is dirty
Having more babies than Lauryn
She started showing early
As of late I realized, that this is H.E.R. fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me
It's like God is testing me
In retrospect I see she brought life and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform
It's just coffee shop chicks and White dudes
Over H.E.R. I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, making the right moves
Besides God and family, you my life's jewel
Like that y'all, hip-hop

It's like, word up, and it sounds nice

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Yo I'm in the eye of the storm, where the pressure's on
And MC's is dressed funny like a leprechaun
I chop rappers up like chicken seczuan
Sells a squads off like a slave auction
Aiyyo my zodiac sign read caution
On stage, I make your seed to an or-phan
Yo, my age an algebraic equation
Niggas want some? I hit em wit a portion
Son, The Fifth foursome, armed at the door son
M-illi-tilla, Dice Raw, quick draw son
You don't want no more son? That's when more come
And drag a nigga Eerie Avenue to Oregon, you're all done
Ladies and gentlemen
Select the weapon at the gate upon entering, The Roots instrumentaling
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit
We hit em like the L at 60th and Market
South Philly clip a hold into a nigga park it
Take sneaks, chains and rings and bracelets
Split back this like we the therapist
Adrenaline, Fifth mic terrorist, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Zigga zigga zigga tryin to get a grip but still slip, so lift me up
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt
You get to know me, you poke me slowly, when caught puzzin'
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't
Punked em wit a dozen of pellets all in they skelet
Transform, from the norm, start to brainstorm
Yeah Malik be from The Roots, he ain't gone
I took the wrong exit, the sign said Langhorne
I'm trapped up in about five worlds wit live pearls
Shouts to Armour Akquan who's name is Jalil
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand it
Demandin', takin' you back like Knots Landing
I'm Ralph Cramdon, we out, you'll see in Hampton
Yo what the what the what the, what the what the what the
Pivot on this concrete earth until I rot
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet but still I plot, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Beans passed the mack and we held em, like hostages
Rappers see me, hide they face like ostriches
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages
Underwater rap, you know who the bosses is
North Philly baby, that's where that Raw shit is
You'll get blown out the sky once you get talkative
A-D devise rise, I fathered it
So when you see me on the street, don't bother kid
Just be on your merry way, or you might get slit
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did
Lay you on floors like ya gettin' carpeted
You need a special kind of mic for retarded kids
Me against you's like Kane verse the Partridges
You want to battle, change your name to The Forfeiters
Cause that's what you do, face to face wit raw niggas
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

They used to talk shit, but I'ma quiet them
Kick in the door wit my boys stick to riotin'
First nigga that flinch, I'ma fire em
Tape 'em up, grip his hands, and plyer em
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em?
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him
Paid the front row seat watchin' Iverson
First class air crafts what I'm flyin' in
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them
Used to shotgun in cars, now I'm drivin' 'em
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' them
Ran up in y'all spot wit Rob and them
Grew up, two-four, wit Pie and em
But do my dirt, twenty first, wit Kyle and them
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them
Brother news, nigga schooled Marley Park and them
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them
Tore they body all up, ain't no chalkin' 'em
Too sharp for them, move out in the dark on em
These Illadel foul streets what I'm stompin' in once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Yo I'm in the eye of the storm, where the pressure's on
And MC's is dressed funny like a leprechaun
I chop rappers up like chicken seczuan
Sells a squads off like a slave auction
Aiyyo my zodiac sign read caution
On stage, I make your seed to an or-phan
Yo, my age an algebraic equation
Niggas want some? I hit em wit a portion
Son, The Fifth foursome, armed at the door son
M-illi-tilla, Dice Raw, quick draw son
You don't want no more son? That's when more come
And drag a nigga Eerie Avenue to Oregon, you're all done
Ladies and gentlemen
Select the weapon at the gate upon entering, The Roots instrumentaling
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit
We hit em like the L at 60th and Market
South Philly clip a hold into a nigga park it
Take sneaks, chains and rings and bracelets
Split back this like we the therapist
Adrenaline, Fifth mic terrorist, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Zigga zigga zigga tryin to get a grip but still slip, so lift me up
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt
You get to know me, you poke me slowly, when caught puzzin'
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't
Punked em wit a dozen of pellets all in they skelet
Transform, from the norm, start to brainstorm
Yeah Malik be from The Roots, he ain't gone
I took the wrong exit, the sign said Langhorne
I'm trapped up in about five worlds wit live pearls
Shouts to Armour Akquan who's name is Jalil
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand it
Demandin', takin' you back like Knots Landing
I'm Ralph Cramdon, we out, you'll see in Hampton
Yo what the what the what the, what the what the what the
Pivot on this concrete earth until I rot
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet but still I plot, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Beans passed the mack and we held em, like hostages
Rappers see me, hide they face like ostriches
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages
Underwater rap, you know who the bosses is
North Philly baby, that's where that Raw shit is
You'll get blown out the sky once you get talkative
A-D devise rise, I fathered it
So when you see me on the street, don't bother kid
Just be on your merry way, or you might get slit
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did
Lay you on floors like ya gettin' carpeted
You need a special kind of mic for retarded kids
Me against you's like Kane verse the Partridges
You want to battle, change your name to The Forfeiters
Cause that's what you do, face to face wit raw niggas
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

They used to talk shit, but I'ma quiet them
Kick in the door wit my boys stick to riotin'
First nigga that flinch, I'ma fire em
Tape 'em up, grip his hands, and plyer em
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em?
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him
Paid the front row seat watchin' Iverson
First class air crafts what I'm flyin' in
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them
Used to shotgun in cars, now I'm drivin' 'em
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' them
Ran up in y'all spot wit Rob and them
Grew up, two-four, wit Pie and em
But do my dirt, twenty first, wit Kyle and them
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them
Brother news, nigga schooled Marley Park and them
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them
Tore they body all up, ain't no chalkin' 'em
Too sharp for them, move out in the dark on em
These Illadel foul streets what I'm stompin' in once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

What the fuck, what what what?
Nuttin' new, nuttin' new
What? Nuttin' new check
Nuttin' new, nuttin' new, y'all not sayin' nuttin' new
I represent the legendary fifth dynasty crew
Nuttin' new, nuttin' new, y'all not sayin' nuttin' new
Nuttin' new, nuttin' new, y'all not sayin', check shit out
It's nuttin' new, nuttin' new, y'all not sayin' nuttin' new
Nuttin' new, nuttin' new

Ghetto related with this hit the whole world awaited
Y'all dorito-head cats that yak and stagnated
Black thought, the Doug E. most war vete-ran
Crown ruler, soul controller of this lyrical land
Spliff wizard kid, who is it?
Fifth dinosaur ghetto, beat detonator
Apex my level, next, my complex pattern of speech is like sex
I mastered the art of makin' you snap the necks
And chase Manhattan endorse my mic checks
Upset, poet threat
Just collectin' my debt, yo I'm overpaid in dues
Blood tears and sweat, when you fuckin' with the roots
That's as good as it get, ultra magnet
We pull you in a drag-net then brainwash your click
And extort your assets, then roadie all your homies
On some old school shit, roots crew represent
Life's a gamble, step up and place your bets
I drift through space, then make my escape on through the 'net
With CD's, cassettes, no C.O.D.'s or checks
Straight from the old school, aiyyo raw's in full effect
I'm like, Lex Luthor with rifles filled with kryptonite
When you grip the mic it's like c'mon kids, let's say goodnight
You don't like me but don't even know why should you hate me
You scared to face these so I still remain safely
Confidin', north phil' where I'm residin'
Never let an outside nigga slide in
This ain't home plate, I dunk on you once inside the paint
Flow like this you can't, take me you out, you ain't

Nuttin new, nuttin new, y'all not sayin nuttin new
Nuttin new, nuttin new, y'all not sayin nuttin new
Nuttin new, nuttin new, tell me what you could do
Yo we drop the funk, and do the shit

Yo, head lost, sippin' this limbic framboise
Spittin' it for like whoever demand the answer
What's the cure for this hip-hop cancer? Equivalent
To this avalanche of black snow, rap flow
To get my people thinkin' mo', we at the brink of war
What does it all mean? What's it all for?
With knowledge of yourself, then you're through the first door
My people hungry and thirst for more next music explore
It's heavenly to your ebony daughter next door
So what you think the roots get the world respect for?
The splendid authentic hip-hop that's raw core
Severe, world premier, a superior sophomore
No doubt, wherever you dwell, that's where the bomb fell
Explodin' from the imperial en-sem-ble, for real
From the ven-ue to the avenue
We truly only got respect for a few, y'all ain't sayin' nuttin' new

Nuttin' new, nuttin' new, y'all not sayin' nuttin' new
Represent the legendary fifth dynasty crew
Roots crew comin' through, tell me what you could do

Blow up y'all, it's nuttin' new, nuttin' new

Look at y'all you just a army ant, I'm a gi-ant, arm fist
King of my city, runnin' this shit, just like a ty-rant
Y'all clowns know what I meant, that's if we at war
Then my henchmen, will be at your back door, uhh
Waitin', wise at debatin', trippin' over legos
Runnin' up the steps and lookin' for a weapon
But you come out wavin' a white flag, that's why
I just back slap that ass like shaq did ostertag
Either take me or be taken, you think I'm goin' down?
Psych, the jury, they're still deliberatin'
I got half of they kids, tied up in a basement
Nah I'm just playin' yo but that's how I'm playin' doe
Dig what I'm sayin yo? D I see E
Shove a mic in your mouth, like Ted Dibiase
When you come sloppy, fuck is y'all tryin' to do?
Y'all into, some wack shit, and ain't sayin' nuttin' new

Nuttin' new, nuttin' new, y'all not sayin' nuttin' new
Represent the legendary fifth dynasty crew

As I wait for atonement
Trapped in the heat of the moment
Feelin' like I can't control it
As I wait for atonement
Trapped in the heat of the moment

Uh huh, feelin' the steam from the cauldron
With tension runnin' deep as the ocean
Many are called, but so few are chosen
As I go through the motions, of medication uppin' my dosage
Bangin' Earth, Wind & Fire "Devotion" as I admire the focus
Takin' the city with a grain of salt
Where they tastin' foul, chase it down, with the latest malt liquor
Roll and hit it, knife did it, hope you got some smarts with you
Hope you got some heart it ain't no stoppin' when it start, nigga
Feel somethin' bigger got a hold on me
And I ain't trippin' not a Bobby Brown, lippin' with my nose runnin'
Basically I had two, options I just chose one
And then got ghost, like my picture was on a most wanted
Coast to coast, from L.A. to Chicago
Now I'm faced, with the weight of survival, plus the taste
From the way I been lied to while the preacher man spittin' his gospel
I can win if I try to

As I wait for atonement
Trapped in the heat of the moment
Feelin' like I can't control it
As I wait for atonement
Trapped in the heat of the moment

Slow down when you're hitting them corners 
Fuck around, spill this 'gnac on my two hundred dollar suit 
 

 
Your ma don't like to jitterbug, said this unholy music 
Hip hop just so ridiculous, everything sounds so confusing 
Nowadays ain't nothing like it was, one thing that showed the blues 
Is this system so mysterious, can't let that stop the movement 
Can't get no satisfaction, they all laughing, glad it's happening 
All wings hot for the main attraction 
Acting a fool with a lust for action 
Young girl caught in a crime of passion 
Sitting there crying in designer fashion 
Didn't blow, didn't have time for asking 
Somebody call for the ambulance, girl 

Baby, baby, baby 
Baby let me live, please girl let me slide 
Baby, baby, baby 
Baby if you let me go, I swear I'll change, just change your mind 

Your old man don't like to jitterbug, said this old dirty music 
Hip hop just so ridiculous, them stories too confusing 
Nowadays he ain't loving you like he was 
And you ain't there just for using 
Could have sworn that was him with another girl 
And they wasn't out just for cruising 
Can't get no satisfaction 
He out late nights, probably smashing 
Leaving a trail like Charlie tracks 
Or the train on the ground, downtown Manhattan 
Everybody seen him run around and you bound to catch him 
The condoms, you found and asked him, was all this just for practice? 
He didn't realize what he had 
Now your heart got fractured girl 

Baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby, baby

Two, three, break!
All the world still here, scratchin' scratch x2
All the world are still here to hear us
I stress to much, I stress to much, I stress, stress, stress, stress to much
One, ... two
All the world are still here to hear us
Check 'dis out, yeah x2
Were on the mike
Were in charge
The star of the show x2
P for people x2
Listen?, listen?, listen?, listen?, listen?
Build they made a fake it, how many marks? x4
I know you're gonna dig this

The son won't face the father
The gun won't erase the drama
While you're waitin' the time's up

What is it we wanna do?
Now that I'm allowed to be alone with you
Birthday Girl its your birthday
Wherever you wanna go 
Now you are old enough to go and see the are-rated show now
Are-rated show 

Yo, She said she was a magazine editor named Jenning 
Backstage in high heels and painted on jeans 
Probably had the most devious eyes I'd ever seen
Told me she was twenty-two she was only seventeen
She had sumthin' to hide she snuck in from outside 
And got everybody gassed like the car I drive
With all that grown lady ass and my for rap vibe
She said she came to see them roots boy fallout live
But listen,

Verse 2 
You see the girls look good but they brains not ready 
I talk to a woman, he mind more steady 
Probably something in the way they designed just more steady
I just let you recite cause the line so heavy
But I shoulda known better cause now I feel like America's underbelly 
R. Kelly got a smart better less, internet predators, chat-room irregulars
This not my twist 
You trying to send me to the therapist 

Verse 3: 
Now she told me cheddar cheese grits 
Two tomato fried fish 
Cause she heard its my dish
Tryna be my sidekick 
All the people all around thinking she was my chick 
Saying DAMN the girl thick 
But she ain't no twenty-six
Looking at me like am up to sumthin' on the funny tip 
Like I ever been the one to honey jib
Its your birthday so let me know the gift you wanna get 
In fact blow out the candles on the cake and make a wish for me 

Hook 
They can't really seem to look away 
So they tried asking her to stay
Fake I.D. you won't get turned away
You look lovely tonight
Now you are old enough to buy a gun 
So many better ways of having fun 
Right now I can only think of one
You look lovely tonight. 

Hold your flix, I'm not for the photo op's
It's Black, code name Yaphet Kotto ock
My twist like a ratchet in an auto shop
Since granddaddy old Desoto stopped and he got the Caddie
I been gladly servin, any y'all cats want to act determined
Spit pesticides for rats and vermin
Seem like none of y'all chumps is learning
Y'all hopeless, and I'm a little better than dope is
Far from a brand new kid to show biz
Tryna hold on, maintain my focus
Coming out a room with a could of smoke
Smokers rolling with the punches
I survive and rock
Cause I keep the crowd alive
And the texture of my voice
Is course and kind of hoarse and cut
Like I'm throwing a thousand knives

Party people gather round what we have here is a brand new sound
Reach for my waist you hit the ground
You better duck when that awful sound goes
Boom
That's what's happenin in the parking lot
That's what's happenin on stage

The man at hand that rule the school
And reach and teach the blind and find a way from A to Z
And be the most to boast I'm load and proud
The game and reign that remain
The heat is on so feel the fire come off the empire or the
More higher level of depth one step beyond dope
To suckers all scope and hope to cop a note
Cause I could never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of Monopoly
Let it speed around the board like an astro
And send them to jail for tryna pass go
Shaking them up
Breaking them up
Taking no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So quest love let the fire roast
So I can flow and we can kill the whole show cause

Party people gather round what we have here is a brand new sound
Reach for my waist you hit the ground
You better duck when that awful sound goes
Boom
That's what's happenin in the parking lot
That's what's happenin on stage

I'm live
Design a finer rhyme that's right on time
One step beyond and not behind the line
That separates thought from divine
You can take it as a caution or a warning sign
Look for antonyms
Words I'm sending em
Homonyms, synonyms good like M&M's
You know the time when it's Riq Gees slicing
I turn a Mic's last name into Tyson
My brain like a factory constantly creating
Materials stitch by stitch for decoration
My lyrics one fabric the beat is a lining
My passion of rhyming is fashion designing
Now it get sorted cause people want to sport it ya bought it
If you didn't then you couldn't afford it
Poetry full of surprises it's like a game show
And my brain go
I do my thing yo

Yeah baby

Bad misses, throwin' raspberry kisses on me
You looking for directions girl?
I feel your vision on me
Just don't let him see you sweatin'
And we ain't spose to be involved
Knowing when we get it off, Girl I mean it off
Keeping you fiending 'til you taking it tossed
And when I'm breaking it off
Its no denying the fact it's wrong
Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason, Uh
Is it because he's superficial
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it 'cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
And get stripped and shown, the way the getting is on
The cost, dealing with this you only taking a loss
You need to leave him alone
And go with the one who breaking you off

Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Yeah baby

Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Yeah baby

Brother down the hall
The one you bound to call
Workaholics are really I'm rarely around at all
What we started got serious repercussions in court
We had a chance to turn back, but love that was all
Late nights twistin' something
Listenin to Neicey sing
She got the beef for you telling me you deeply
Appreciate the company, time we spend
I feel the same, it's a shame you ain't my girlfriend
Cause listen, you need a brotha with the physical fix
Who come through in the mix
For you with no head tricks or fraud

You need a new position and who can get you open
Like eucalyptus and have ready to go for yours
Come on and work with me, you won't get hurt with me
Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainly

Dealing with this you won't be taking a loss
You need to leave him alone and roll
With the one who's breaking you off

Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Yeah baby

Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Comin' to break you off
Yeah baby

Rolling down the highway
Listening to Sade sing
"The way the smooth operator move my way"
You sitting beside me
Looking like Friday Foster
Pam Grier structure look at your body
Keep each other thirsty
Kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed
Cause we don't need the controversy
I say I'm in town, You say you want it in the worst way
You probably told your man it was your it was ya lil's birthday
Meanwhile, its champagne chilling in ice
You ready for the freakiest stage you done in ya life?
We breakin' down like we grove dogs pulling a hike
You making sounds like a vive got you reaching your height
Prepare for flight, this is your captain
I'm getting strapped in
There's no denying the strength
That its attraction girl
Workin' with this you won't be taking a loss
So stop fooling your man and roll with the one
Who's breaking you off

Bad misses, throwin' raspberry kisses on me
You looking for directions girl?
I feel your vision on me
Just don't let him see you sweatin'
And we ain't spose to be involved
Knowing when we get it off, Girl I mean it off
Keeping you fiending 'til you taking it tossed
And when I'm breaking it off
Its no denying the fact it's wrong
Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason, Uh
Is it because he's superficial
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Or is it 'cause you really couldn't see a future with him
All he about is paper, never took the time with you to listen
You want it gripped up, flipped, and thrown
And get stripped and shown, the way the getting is on
The cost, dealing with this you only taking a loss
You need to leave him alone
And go with the one who breaking you off

Brother down the hall
The one you bound to call
Workaholics are really I'm rarely around at all
What we started got serious repercussions in court
We had a chance to turn back, but love that was all
Late nights twistin' something
Listenin to Neicey sing
She got the beef for you telling me you deeply
Appreciate the company, time we spend
I feel the same, it's a shame you ain't my girlfriend
Cause listen, you need a brotha with the physical fix
Who come through in the mix
For you with no head tricks or fraud

You need a new position and who can get you open
Like eucalyptus and have ready to go for yours
Come on and work with me, you won't get hurt with me
Just keep it real and you'll get broken off certainly

Dealing with this you won't be taking a loss
You need to leave him alone and roll

You sitting beside me
Looking like Friday Foster
Pam Grier structure look at your body
Keep each other thirsty
Kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed
Cause we don't need the controversy
I say I'm in town, You say you want it in the worst way
You probably told your man it was your it was ya lil's birthday
Meanwhile, its champagne chilling in ice
You ready for the freakiest stage you done in ya life?

Last of the red hot , lovin' emcees
Who came up poor, grits and government cheese
The only thing I ever really loved in my life, was a mic
Some of my niggaz fell in love with MP's, come on
Work the bass, nigga, juggle them keys
I'm tryin'a get a piece of this government green
And smack 'em in the melon with another LP
C'mon, help a couple people in the struggle get free
We from the block, where people stay prepared to rock
And it's hard, 'cause opportunity be scared to knock
And mo' people in the 'hood found dead from cops
Than guns that drop, that sprayed off random shots
But what'cha know good, people say they in the hood fo' good
You ain't a prisoner, the world got mo' to it
Sky's the limit, it don't take but a minute
Don't fear for your people, nigga, my hood's yo hood
Yeah, we did it

I know in these tryin' times it feels confusin'
That's why I came to y'all to dance to the music
Unless, we face it first and try not to lose it
Even if it gets worse, they Can't Stop This 

Can't Stop This, I want my peoples to rock this
Bang this music in your speakers and boxes
Legs and users, 'bout as a deep as my thoughts is
Sit back and I'mma paint you a portrait
This stuff can make you think you are lost
This shit can have you exhausted
Just, picture the planet and imagine it's yours, kid
Don't ever let nobody knock you outta your orbit
I never seen a bridge we couldn't shuffle across it
We got a lotta people livin' a life, that's pure trivia
Real hip hop, I ain't tryin'a get rid of ya
Can't have that, because here come, the city of Philly
Put an end to all the trivia, really
Where I'm walkin' everybody ain't pretty or friendly
It's work, my whole life they ain't give me a penny
Comin' up between a rock and a hard, watchin' for God
People, hip hop, and with no option at all
Yo, it's how it's goin' down

I know in these tryin' times it feels confusin'
That's why I came to y'all to dance to the music
Unless, we face it first and try not to lose it
Even if it gets worse, they Can't Stop This 

We bring the ? part of raps, the special sounds
The robe's long enough to be considered a gown
Thought's pen is sharp enough to be considered a crown
When the plate come, take some, pass it around
It's the last of the hip hop lovin' emcees
In front of an audience that never been pleased
I'm comin' from all the streets that never been cleaned
And speakin' for any faith that never been seen
This debeneir style of my words is high-caliber
Speakin' my mind for every day that's on the calendar
Cause I'll'a been quiet, about as long as I can handle it
Walked a mile in these boots that I'm standin' in
Mellow soul brother with his lyrical dean on
The stages I'm seen on, mic I fiend on
When it's all full of soul, that's when it means more
I never hesitate to give a shoulder to lean on, yo
Check it out, man

I know in these tryin' times it feels confusin'
That's why I came to y'all to dance to the music
Unless, we face it first and try not to lose it
Even if it gets worse, they Can't Stop This 

Yeah, sitting in the staircase, holding back tears
Looking over mad years worth of photographs
Pictures of some places I ain't never going back
Some people I used to love, why I ain't show them that?
The skies was overcast, when I was sober last
My head is spinning, couldn't tell you if it's slow or fast
It's starting to get too clear, I got to go and grass
To y'all it's a shame but life is what we know it as
Waiting, navigating the plot, without plans
In the car, it's hard to read as a clock with no hands
How your man's goin' get up and stop with no yams
All it take is one break, it could pop the program
Whether sinning or not, my back bending like I'm sentenced a lot
I feel some brothers is beginning to plot
It might have been a close friend I forgot
Who started up and ain't remember to stop
I bet these niggas going remember the shop

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know

Yo, I'm like Malcolm out the window with the weapon out
Searching for somehow to find a minute or the second now
Precious time is money that I ain't got to mess about
Need it from the horse's mouth or from my eye with less account
Lessons with my back to the wall, scoping my session out
Stay a little edgy at times when I ain't stressing bout
Haters don't know shit about me, they the ones that talk shit
Those that love me send it out, so I ain't got to force quit
Cause I'm doing better now, don't mean I never lost shit
I was married to a state of mind and I divorced it, man
I'm from where brothers moving product from the porches
People locking their doors, clutching to their crosses
The block hot by the law, there ain't too many choices
So what I do is for y'all, there ain't too many voices left
I watch my back, and watch my step
And I might forgive, but I will not forget come on

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know

Yo, living in turbulent times
The blind leading the blind
Some call it evolution, some say intelligent design
You say you want a revolution, you out of your mizind
Your sons' destitute, and their pops all in the prison
My man's back in the jam, he like the back of my hand
He just attracted to scam, he right back in the can
I never sleepwalking, you dig
You get your shuteye
I'm on the first thing in, I'm leaving on the red-eye
My brother back in rehab, just had another relapse
But fin himself, it's been like he's been fighting an energy
Half telling me nobody true when they pretend to be that
So closer than friends, that's where I keep my enemy at
To many parties concerned, it's time to live it and learn
Until we're able to grow, forever bridges we burn
My thoughts free as a bird, that's just about to emerge
And every action is heard, it speaks louder than words, yo

People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know

Yeah, to all the Jim Carrey ass large co-op
KnowhatI'msayin? Large co-op, what the fuck?
To the clones, we bless the domes
Blow the vial, you know my style, large co-op
Freestyle all the way son
Dice

First of all let's talk about these ill capers
And fly ass frontin' bitches that now caught vapors
Niggaz run up on you with guns, snatchin' papers
Outlined body chalk, is how they would scrape ya
From off the pavement, I hate gettin' locked up
Cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships
But then the bible never saved shit
I guess that's why every juvenile is in the same predicament
You want to slang crack, or hold tecs, and do the concept
You can't make loot, when your moms is smokin' up the product
I try to tell ya, don't let these streets fuckin' fail ya
The way niggaz be gettin' clapped shit'll fuckin' scare ya
But in the dark, we ran wild, so we killin' 'em
Niggaz scared, can't stand still, like fuckin' helium
Fake niggaz, they don't go platinum they go aluminum
Got em cloned the fuck up son, that's why we losin em
I'm lookin' at this niggaz longevity
To make a big play, but then it might be a mistake
Cause if I get sent to D.C., I'm sendin' Dice to DE
With three p's, so when I get out, he can see me
For real, 'cause the streets is filled with snakes and rats
The snake will be that bitch and that rat will be that cool cat
With swollen pockets we gonna take you back home
Master Allah Rule Savior, never clone

Yo, I use the mic to slap you in the face and erase your taste
Disgrace your date put your title to waste
Dominant lyrical grace, from a place called wild
Illadelph Isle Pensy, that's the residency
Consist in currency, my pockets never empty
Some cats, believe they MC but we know they all fraud
Do a show in Philly niggaz wouldn't applaud
Nobody know your record nor who you openin' for
Can tell your squad's artificial while approachin' the door
So you should prepare, for lyrical terror that's pure
Step up to the reservoir, of the soul proprietor style
Messiah or, the higher law down with Dice Raw
The matador, shorty connoisseur
Stompin' whatever you build to the floor
Similar to that of a dinosaur
I told you I'm the rap predator
You insist to imitate, what for?
Superstar niggaz is ten percent real, ninety percent invented
For a fuckin' record deal
Comin' with somethin' veterans can't feel
I hit you like a steel anvil
Because you grafted off the next man's skill
But still I remain mellow, seein' the theatrics of Othello
Run over tactics of the
See-L-O/N-E-S fess
The phoniest cats is felonious 

Dice Raw the juvenile lyricist corner store terrorist
Block trooper, connoisseur of fine cannabis
Focus never weak, blow up the spot like plastique
Leave a nigga shook, to the point, he won't speak
Never half-assed, always live and direct
On bitches try to punk smell the panty and raw sex
Mad lights I had to black out, when fake niggaz act out
Or step out of place, they get slapped in they face
All y'all niggaz is fake, tryin' to emulate my style
What grown man? In this game, to me you're a child
I trained wack MC's, in camps like ex-marines
Why the fuck you think you went home and had bad dreams
Of horrifying things, that your ass never seen before?
You traveled to the realm of Dice Raw
Where clones get they dome blown with chrome microphones
It's not your fault black, just the fact you wasn't shown
You'll come through this like a smurf
I got you rollin' stop off the earth
Represent while I been like this since birth
And I won't be the last but I definitely was the first
Dice Raw big car Logan's Isle sol-dier

Don't come across that line or pay a cost
Knuckle games and hammer cocked ain't nothing sweet or soft
Win lose or draw to the jaw take one
Deranger lyrical launcher, or station
No conversation is needed, my task completed
Read a nigga up and down in the cut where I'm seated
Snatch you from your cloud of cannabis you ignoramuses
You laid on your lap, when I attack your glamorous
Lifestyle, I banged your head up with the white fowl
My character a product of this two-one-fifth trife style
I breeze through areas niggaz would fear to walk in
Balance the talkin', that galactic style as of a falcon
Your Star Trek ass will wrinkle
Spill these words and form into a sprinkle
Cap you're brought up and the name of twinkle
My insight will crack the windpipe of y'all niggaz
Whether small, middle-sized, or tall niggaz
Just tie your name next when I start to X
Givin out flex pains of death so fuck a raincheck
The insane vet, whether you ganked the brain wet
You proceed to lame check, the opposite of same sex
I annihilate your type if you violate
Makin' your blood rush, you post never a higher rate

Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust 

Chorus: Black Thought 

It's Common Dust y'all, and you don't stop
For you to trust y'all, with real hip-hop

Thought be the ? of the styles of speech
A dusty head brother mighta saw the bleach
Teach I aims not, just to talk my sense
Damn I gives not, 'bout the consequence
Funk the stylistics, and jazz the vibe
Laughs at e-tudes cause I'm stayin alive
Time I grips not, so it limps along
Dust you, collect if you digs my song
Paids and black braids what I aims to ease
Connection L-7 throwin out the breeze
Cool breeze to blow up cause I bust the shit
I'm just a sun child rollin in a dustin ship
It's like that y'all

Thought's a Black miss you wanna catch the Crumbs
When I hums a fat song, with derelicts and bums
Smoke gems with the folk from the cellar when they come
Mouth be like cotton, got sticks of gum
Common spear-a-mint, it's like sense is Dust
Accumulation much cause naps I got nuff
Funk feeds the dome see the trees they wanna rise
Out sprouts the ?, free to vocalize
Old school highs I got, for your eyes
Circulize never even though we lock together
Ask the set I'm clever cause I'm severed and I'm pooped
But anyway the wind blows, the Dust you gotta go

Chorus

It's like Crumbs stay at a mic, comes to and from the ashes
Pass the what kid? L-7, we massive
Jazz the funk, slow-be-poke, baby she be glass
Puff the stuff you have now I recline and make you laugh
Roots can boost knot and off the docks I rocked your riches
The Edgar shit is locked, that's, if the force is with us
Yeah, deeps pon the streets I reach, be the sound
A pouch full of ouch, soon the freaks is freakin out, uhh
Threes that make you shout, 'bout, ruckus on the corner
Black, ?uest and Rubber, we did it in the summer
Now the po' folk is near, they say I'm not a Square
But when the circle's Root, Black see if I'll be there
It's like that y'all

Dig it, cool for me I'm glad when I springs from pad
To those with mad Dust I be just a lad
Rock me rocks not cause my Thoughts is Black
Sports the A-di-das plus my proton pack
Accumulatin Dust as my trail mix crush
Digs the naturale, baby flush the blush
Yeah, when it roams, find your way back home
And dig it with the kids with the Dust-y dome
Soon your zigs roam when you brooms the scene
Dust you gots not, cause your rooms is clean
Trust I knows much cause I blows the horn
It's Common Dust y'all, you go on and on

Chorus

I've been wondering about the complexity
Of what we have it shouldn't be
More
Just can't see
More

You're physically in this, but how could we tell
If we was meant to be in bliss if you're not mentally as well?
This energy you're sending me is tricky as hell
Usually it's like a 50/50, we could take a L
Before we start things, at this point being apart brings
The feeling of somebody plucking at your heart strings
I know it probably shouldn't feel like this
But any other woman I see is in your likeness
It's from your cheekbones
Yo your lips, to your curves, to your deep moans
To that walk, to your words
You love feeling like a breakdown on the verge
First we on good terms, then you on my last nerves
Got my back just aching, my shoes is all tight
It's too complex when we choose to do it right
It's wrong, one minute you a soldier strong
Then you trying a route talking about it's over and gone

When your boyfriend's in town, it's bound to be trouble, Love
His name Black, and he known to be a lover of
Getting it on with my smoker's jacket on
Eyes racing back and forth listening to Chaka Khan
Trying to figure the cause why you always acting off
like I'm slacking off
Maybe our signal's getting crossed
For the case Love, you feel like you making a waste of
Your precious time you need to get a taste of
Some space to breathe, a moment as friends
We should've felt ourselves slipping into it again
'Cause it's like off and on, on and off
Passion, lost and found, found and lost
Clashing, asking for nothing but understanding
Your hearts made of glass, use care when handling
Girl, all in all I never leave you stranded
'Cause my respect you commanded, you figure it out

I used to come into the party and stand around
'Cause I was kinda too shy to really get down
I used to play the corner and watch the scene
Deep down knowing I wanted to find me a queen
And I could feel that in my stomach and up in my chest
Because I knew a lot of women, and some was fresh
But then I found you girl, and just like me
You had a heart that was yearning to be set free
Now listen, see you and me we need to take the time
To erase any doubt that's inside your mind
It's not a mountain that I'm ever too tired to climb
And who's counting, but I know at least a thousand times
I let you know I'm here for you, care for you, and confide in you
Break bread, share with you, and provide for you
And that's full time, it's no 9 to 5 with you
That's why I'm trying to work it out with you, it's gonna work

The concerto, of the desperado
R-double-O-T-S check the flow
If you know like I know then you know the motto
That's all the fake shit gots to go

In the glow of the moon, over the melancholy metro
My poetry is set like a U.F.O.
The maestro, the lyricist concerto
My physical play the role of a vessel
The level of my lyrics law manifesto
My thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts
of a gorilla stronger than Samson
Without vanilla my soliloquoy profess my ability to just
stimulate you like the best sensimilla
The halflife the Illadel-L-P-O-phila proceed
hither is my death flower blow your tower to smithereens 
to fiends catch another rhyme gripper
Deeper than the meditations of a Hindu worshiper
Unorthodox, hip-hop, minister
Than a Serengeti cheetah my thoughts swifter
you lose your balance when the sound hits ya
So check for the, Fifth Militia
A poet's under pressure stressin' that you get the picture
Even if it means you gotta hang over the banister
I pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher
And take advantage of ya because you amateur
Styles gunning down your sound man and manager
What? This how we do it in the year for nine-six
With this delivering attack on pointless rap shit
Breakin MC's down to fractions, tell your squadron
It's time to go to war, reaction

The concerto, of the desperado
R-double-O-T-S check the flow
If you know like I know then you know the motto
That's all the fake shit gots to go

Treat MC's like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
Leavin these niggas open like a box of Pandora
With styles that's newer than the world order
Approximately three quarters of y'all are water
I straight deport ya
Then orchestrate your torture with roots of culture
The pill brimmage to the line of scrimmage up against your image
Where life is a heist, and the strong get a percentage
It's ill as a war and within it I'm the Lieutenant
that surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
You fold like Japan's futons and fans
While I design a plan to make a rapper step like a pedestrian
I crush a mountain into grands of sand
Your pain stains the hand that held the mic inserted to the stand
The desperado, that refuse to follow
The Fifth afficianado, break you up into parts like vibrato
I deep like the dark of the night
Niggas is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic
They use the simple back and forth the same
old rhythm that's plain
I'd rather UltraMagnetize your brain
It's the hip-hop purist, that leave you lost like a tourist

Monday they predict the storm
Tuesday they predict the bad
Wednesday they cover the grass
And I can see it's all about cash
And they got the nerve to hunt down my ass
And treat me like a criminal

Look, it is what it is
Because of what it was
I did what I did
Cause it does what it does
I don't put nothin' above
What I am, what I love
My family, my blood
My city and my hood
Hater for the greater good
I'm back from Hollywood
And I ain't changed a lick
Though, I know I probably should
But, what I'm doin' is not a good look
I never did it by the good book, as a lifetime crook
All the petty crime took a toll on me
I look around at my homies that's gettin' old on me
But still somethin' gotta hold on me
Maybe it's faith
If it's comin', yo I'm willing to wait
I'm not runnin', I done ran through the mud
I done scrambled and such
I done robbed an odd job and gambled enough
Till I'm put up in handcuffs
And pissin' in a cup
If there's a God,
I don't know if he listenin' or what

Yeah, it is what it is
And that's how it go
Get treated like a criminal
If crime is all you know
Get greeted like a nigga
If a nigga saw your show
A public enemy, to send a eye in the scope
My city like a island where you can't find a boat
Have you wishin' for a raft
And prayin' that hope flows
Some real f'ing things going down low so,
Who lookin' for a chair and some real strong rope
Just to end it all here
Screamin' "fuck the mayor"
He see the faces at the bottom of the welfare
They act like I'm somethin' to fear
Trapped in urban warfare
And pullin' triggers at a college career
Can't ignore the call of the wild
That's drawin' 'em near
Try to make fast money last long some years
Try to laugh it off
Still couldn't lose the tears
To the rules, I will not adhere
Break the law, yeah

Who wanna challenge mine?
I'm sick of St. Valentine
I did the violent crimes
That's why I got this style of rhyme
Seek repentance to spittin' them sentences
To senseless experience is the difference
You can't convince this
In a crime sense, niggas is infants
I'm like a senior citizen
Still livin' but gettin' benefits
Put emphasis on hittin' my nemesis in high percentages
Crooked ass cops is the reason for my belligerence
And it gets deeper than that
Remember nights I used to sleep wit a gat
With a package of crack under my sneaker strap
D's sneak attack and raid me
It took a week for that
Beat the rat, but you're sayin' "look, he think he the mack"
Fuck yall!
Niggas who thinkin' they might try us
Watch us inside riots
Blue cars and light fires
We already been knocked, scrutinized
Plus, cops rush to brutalize us
America's polluted by lust
Who could I trust?
If I can't trust you, then I might touch you
If I ain't got love for you
Then fuck you!

Datskat! I know you dig it when I kick it baby!

Di-bi-dis-banks, hip-flip-a-didip-didim-dow-hound
You wonder bout the sweat pon my brow, formulatin nouns
I'll get down, boogie brother rock on, right on, right on
The brown, rhymer organically grown, I've shown, while
Sip-pida-didip-styles and proceed, to flow
You know I'm flyer than G.I. so yo Joe
Fuck, I run amuck, cause I'm the father of the fattest skatter
Black is intellectual, cat that is perpetually
Ritually catchin wreck, don't step, I cut ya
I mix the Sector 6 and now I knowledge butter words
To prop up Afrika Bambaataa, a lotta, brother is out there
Waitin on that new shit, well this is how we do kid
The levels is correct one-two, call in a blunt too
The front two, run through, good for you
Brand new styles like Kung-Fu
And rip this from the front to the back
To all my peoples where you at I know you dig it when I kick

Datskat! I know you dig it when I kick it baby!

Wadibi-dee-doo-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
Skiggy-dang, skiggy-dang, you knows we gonna rock
And don't stop, just droppin off my bags you fags
When you define, the word behind, deserves you lags
We blast off like launchers, launchin off the rockets
If you bugs, if you act like plugs, you're gettin pulled
Out of sockets, the extra-curricular particularly this
Miraculous in lyrics they be callin me Jesus
Please just call me Malik I'm not a prophet
Pass me a topic and I'll drop it
Because it gets, hairier, never marry or flurries a throne
To hell with a boy upon the microphone
Will be convenient, I'm never bein lenient
On them folk who gonna slow-up cause they a dope
But a-bi-dee-doo-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
We makin touchdowns, cause we knockin butts down, so

Datskat! I know you dig it when I kick it baby!

Yo momma went on moose
Our soldiers took 'em all
She pulled 'em in the street
That street said I smell feet

She wanna know if we can be together
Man even if it ain't gon' be forever
Well it can only be for one night
The only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic

Trust me it's somethin' bout the way I touch her
The way that I hold her, the way I clutch her
She move a lot but that ain't shit to me
Man, I need that bitch and that bitch need me
And I ain't even talkin' bout r.a.p.
Them other ladies be the same, they no worry me 
Sit back, I spit that shit that get better than
Make a veteran sit back
Cruisin', mic check one twos
And if y'all not us then that's why y'all losin'
Ate up, no time to wake up
No masquerades, nigga move the makeup
Just do it, put the hop into it
And when y'all lose it don't blame the music
Half y'all fell in love with the whore
The question is if you don't love her what you fuckin' her for, nigga?

Fucks the problem? dog we mobbin'
The squad roll thicker than some hemoglobin
I'll scare y'all quicker than a mean ol' goblin
Ain't no bullshit, me and my amigos poppin' 
We get started ain't gon' be no stoppin'
You gon' jump because it ain't gon' be no option
I'm totally contagious black rans the gauge ya language
Black thought aka, Larry Davis 
Got rhymes runnin' off the pages
Tighter than the bushes with the Saudi Arabians
Darker than a oil well, sharp as a saber-tooth tiger
Ridin' on a straight edge razor
You walk talkin' on a two way pager
Til ya main thing gettin' me the captain saver
I hold black sly cuz I be the fan of the mic
Grip tight like is not gonna tear ya huh
The hip biatch she ain't ya diop
All that, in a banana cognac diatch
Pony hair coat, my boots is ostriach
Black ink back
Turn me up another ne-otch huh

Young truck in this fuckin' game
What a nigga is, if he runnin' the game
I bring pain from the summer to sprang
Spit game, get ya chick, make her leave wit the game
Wanna talk a little shit I'll make ya walk wit a cane
Got 'em half steppin' like they walk wit cane
Here I am, r-a-w, raw
Truck north introducin' y'all
The way I slang game make ya dame insane
I'm superman, not clark kent to lois lane
I'm out for the paper, y'all out for the fame
There's five left in your fifteen minutes of fame
I ain't got no problems bringin' drama to y'all
You'll never score like a punter runnin' with the ball
I squeeze mics 'til the cords is sore
It's truck north, the man and the myth signin' off, yo

Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes it's so hard to believe it
But, God, I know you have your reasons

They said, "he's busy, hold the line, please"
Call me crazy, I thought maybe he could mind read
Who does the blind lead? Show me a sign, please
If everything is made in China, are we Chinese?
And why do haters separate us like we Siamese?
Technology turning the planet into zombies
Everybody all in everybody's dirty laundry
Acid rain, earthquakes, hurricane, tsunamis
Terrorists, crime sprees, assaults, and robberies
Cops yellin', "stop, freeze," shoot him before he try to leave
Air quality so foul, I gotta try to breathe
Endangered species and we runnin' out of trees
If I could hold the world in the palm of these
Hands, I would probably do away with these anomalies
Everybody checkin' for the new award nominee
Wars and atrocities; look at all the poverty
Ignoring the prophecies, more beef than broccoli
Corporate monopoly, weak world economy
Stock market topplin'
Mad marijuana, Oxycontin, and Klonopin
Everybody out of it?

Well, I've been thinkin' about
And I've been breakin' it down
Without an answer
I know I'm thinking out loud
But if you're lost and around
Why do we suffer?
Why do we suffer?

Yeah, it's still me, one of your biggest fans
I get off work, right back to work again
I probably need to go ahead and have my head exam
Look at how they got me on the Def Jam payment plan
Well, I'm in the world of entertainment and
Trying to keep a singing man sane for the paying fans
If I don't make it through the night, slight change of plans
Harp strings, angel wings, and praying hands
Lord, forgive me for my shortcomings
For going on tour and ignoring the court summons
All I'm trying to do is live life to the fullest
They sent my daddy to you in a barrage of bullets
Why is the world ugly when you made it in your image?
And why is livin' life such a fight to the finish?
For this high percentage when the sky's the limit
A second is a minute, every hour's infinite

Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes it's so hard to believe it

Yo, look at all the scavengers 
All wannabe contenders 
Dismember, wack niggaz I intend ta 
Y'all ain't shit but sticky shit 
On the bottom of Timber-lands 
I know you clam heads want to surrender 
Don't even act like the battlefield the place you want to enter 
Yo niggaz is hopeless, you really need to focus 
On who's the fuckin' dope list or wind up hopeless 
Lookin' for some soup, tryin' to recoup 
Some fuckin' loot, only thing you get is the boot 
To me these punk MC's is nothin' but fruit 
Cakes, shake they booty on stage and get head 
With lyrics that I kick, talkin' that bullshit 
You might get lit like a front of a spliff 
For runnin', off at the lips talkin' that nonsense 
Raw get on stage, take your confidence 
Break you off since powerful defense

Yo, I'm every MC, it's all in me
That's the way it is, when ya gotta be
Indeed as I distort I proceed, I need
Gettin' hotter than sacks of boom, in my room at the Ramada
Four tanks in your memory banks to fill up
I provide the static, with scratch to match, while you catch the vibe
Most can play high post, but yo that don't mean shit
Because my click'll make a motherfucker sick
I flips, redder than pork, comin' to New York to mix
 With the snares and kicks to fix
Rhythmically, you got ta be, static-why
Magically I appear, spark a L and drink a beer
With air smooth, takin' niggaz loot with dice
Then shoot The Roots, poetic, courageously kinetic
Vagabond, versatile and various, plus rap styles
Of mine are blunt, pain is in the mind, so I'm fine and five
Foot seven, inches in height
My mission to strike mics and lighten your tights
Ridin' in, like lightning
Fluorescent, incandescent, effervescently
I represent, Foreign Objects and Ill Elements
Very relevant, plus intelligently managin matter
That's makin' tracks fatter, revolve around
Saturn like rings and brins swings when I sings with bass
Then distort up in your face like mace
Bustin your dreams, I gasp with loaded magazines
I'm on the rap scene, re-color fellas like a vaccine
As I, rocks from under blunderin' I'm not, lyrically
Ya getm, shot, get caught so distort with thought, for real
It's the illest out the Phi, short for Philidelph-iada-fly
Money makin' move fakin' I isn't
Niggaz can nah front, I'm poetically exquisite
Wicked, with the visit while you're wonderin' what is it
Dig it, yo my mellow um whattup for the night
Like that y'all, and yo I'm flowin', my part of the song
It's goin, it's goin, it's gone

Now, go get your dictionary and your Pictionary
Cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries
Words and hers like some cattle in the steeple
People, there's no equal, or no sequel
SO policies, of equalities, get abolished
Demolished, distortion of the static's gettin' polished
Urges of splurge and words will just be merged
Together, damn it's quite clever, however
You never, can sound alike, lyrics don't be poundin' like
These, troops, who be's, Roots
Insult ya, mellow of culture, rhythmical vulture
Approach ya, with Magnetic shit that's Ultra
I make MC's dangle like a bangle
Strangle from every angle, my lingo hingles and it jangles
Under Kangols, nahh them niggaz don't want to tangle
Cause Roots get loose, negroes get juiced like the mango
To be particular, extra-curricular, for pleasure
Measure, in any weather, value more than the treasure
Baby, you say you maybe, then come in to flex
Now you wonder what's next

Well I'm a fly Philly nigga, finger on the trigga
MCs repent from sins, God's comin again
Original , visionary individual
Original , visionary individual
I proceed, as I give ya whatcha need
Like I'm a medical doctor, watch the damage
I inflict properly, ain't nobody risin on top of me
I be droppin more plot in my mic monopoly
Got to be, got to be reality, Stevie Wonder see
Black Thought be me, I groove ba-by
Or I clue they say baby
Would you get with this? Not even maybe
It's the mister gravy and shit
To explain what's goin on inside my brain
You're scared, jealous
No analyst can maintain or handle this...
Mind train, yo
I'm on some old snap a rapper neck shit
You know what I'm sayin?
So niggaz best get out of my path
Kid, I'm on point like a gat
The basket case, I waste MCs with rapture taste
Facing these leads to cats diminished
They be pullin the mic out that ass when I get finished
Administrative assistant I'm not, yo, I'm the principal
Nigga, takin shots, like I'm invincible
Figure me to be hardcore, my input cuts your jaw
For real, for short, do you want more?!!!??!

I keep it doin' it again
Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again
I said it would end

Remix, rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
Straining to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowing I'm sowing seeds, let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said "I mean it", I did it because I need it
Eat, sleep it or bleed it, write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement, your trash talk, deleted
I blast off then lay 'em out like a Tempurpedic
It's Black Thought, for certain I'mma win eventually
This unsung, underrated, under-appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated from one of the most hated
To something that's so sacred, nobody goin' take it
Face it, I keep doin' it well
Doin' it sans assistance, just do it yourself
Doin' it below the radar, we doin' it stealth
Doin' it again for Illadelph, yo, who else?
We goin' do it again!

I keep it doin' it again
Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again
I said it would end

Ayo I'm on my job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
Even though they tried to rob me and sabotage the spot
Just like 'Pac when they got him in the lobby
Try to tax and fine me like Ronald Isley
I's a changed man, ain't no again's or probably's
Niggas used to know me, they don't even recognise me
Yep, the P-5-D is who the repertoire be
Doin' it again just like Poitier and Cosby
I'm like Martin Luther King, you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear diary, the fans still swear by me
Even though I'm Late Night now like "Here's Johnny"
Swimming with them Great Whites now, that's where to find me
Funny how it break right down, but never mind me
Forever grimey, I guess it's just Philly shining
Rock roller, bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman

I keep it doin' it again
Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again
I said it would end

Remix, rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
Straining to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowing I'm sowing seeds, let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said "I mean it", I did it because I need it
Eat, sleep it or bleed it, write it down and then read it

To something that's so sacred, nobody goin' take it
Face it, I keep doin' it well
Doin' it sans assistance, just do it yourself
Doin' it below the radar, we doin' it stealth
Doin' it again for Illadelph, yo, who else?
We goin' do it again!

I keep it doin' it again
Oh, I'm doin' it again
Yes, I'm doin' it again
I said it would end

Ayo I'm on my job, see my eyes focused where the prize be
Even though they tried to rob me and sabotage the spot
Just like 'Pac when they got him in the lobby
Try to tax and fine me like Ronald Isley
I's a changed man, ain't no again's or probably's
Niggas used to know me, they don't even recognise me
Yep, the P-5-D is who the repertoire be
Doin' it again just like Poitier and Cosby
I'm like Martin Luther King, you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear diary, the fans still swear by me
Even though I'm Late Night now like "Here's Johnny"
Swimming with them Great Whites now, that's where to find me
Funny how it break right down, but never mind me
Forever grimey, I guess it's just Philly shining
Rock roller, bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman

It don't feel right, don't feel right, can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

Yo, in the land of the unseen hand that holds trouble
Theorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double
The struggle ain't right up in ya face, it's more subtle
But it's still coming across like the bridge and tunnel vision
I try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen
That's the reason the system making this paper from the prison
And that's the reason we living where they don't wanna visit
Where the dope slangin' keep swangin' like Sonny Liston
The money missing and there's mouths to feed
Get the brain kicking, thinking of a thousand things
Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs
And pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid?
When the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare
People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air
Was it lies when they told you wasn't nothing to fear?
Something don't feel right out here

It don't feel right, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

Look, my eyes open cause I'm really a watchman
And when I'm writing my thoughts out, really I'm boxing
My main adversary any silly concoction
Freeze your face like botulinum toxin
If you ain't trying to get popped, then give me a option
Helicopters chopping from Philly to Compton
The Jones, the Richardsons, the Smiths and the Johnsons
If you ain't saying nothing, you the system's accomplice
It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense
I'm overseeing anything within my circumference
This ain't a press junket, I ain't seeking responses
I stand where the people got the heat in they pockets
You mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness
I spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit
If you ain't speaking your life, your rhyme's adopted
If it don't feel right, then stop it, you know what I'm sayin'?

It don't feel right, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Things don't feel right over here
Lately I ain't been seeing clear
It don't feel right, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Seems to me nowadays things have changed
I don't know if I feel the same

Yo, children working, weapon producing
Natural disaster got the planet in a panic
We all got to make that living
Sex, drugs, murder, politics and religion
Forms of hustling, watch who you put all your trust in
Worldwide, we coincide with who suffering
Who never had shit and ain't got nothing
But more struggling, it makes you wanna run up in the motherfuckin'
Hot zone for a piece of the cake back
I can't work for it, I can certainly take that
I'm fired up, thinking about the payback, ASAP
You fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black
Ill, but that's too real for TV
It's crazy when you too real to be free
If you don't got no paper, then steal this CD
Listen man, I'll let you know how it feel to be me

It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
Things don't feel right over here
Lately I ain't been seeing it clear
It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more
It don't feel right, it don't feel right
Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more

Yeah! That all mighty amazing, ill, highly contagious
Kamikaze south splash like it shot from a gauge
Until your body sound clash
Head of the Class, Magna Cum Laude
Beats bring the beast out me, flagrant, foul rowdy
Reed pipe but deed tight, disposition keep on flipping
Keep em playing they position
Keep making the people listen what I spin
Put em out on a limb
Got tears, got blood, got sweat, leaking out of the pen
Y'all fake niggas not setting a trend
We never listen to them
It's like trying to take a piss in the wind
My home team doing visitors in, yo don't test em
They all standing close to the edge, so don't stress em
Now who the type built to last?
It's no question, the Master!
Villain in Black wit no stets in my sound
Hitting you hard from - every direction
Your head and shoulder, area your midsection dawg!

Yeah
Give it here, and don't say nuthin'
Just give it here, and don't say nuthin'
Cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin'
Nigga, give it here, and don't say nuthin'

Yeah Illadelph, home of the original gun clappers
Out on the wrong corner your shit'll get spun backwards
You got the fool wanting the rules, enter at risk
Or your own nana'll keep a gat under the mattress
Shorties running reckless from Philly to Texas
Surprising what niggas willing to do to get a neckless
Some emotions felt better left unexpressed at times
Niggas' crime record longer than a guest list
Yes, I done seen things you wouldn't believe
Seen people reach levels thought they'd never achieve
Silhouettes waiting in the wings ready to D
Thirst decise or need at least a buck to breathe
C'mon! Stick up kids, they be out to tax
Most times they be sticking you without the gats
I'll still be on the grind when it all collapse
And if it's my worst bar then I'm a take it right back nigga

Yeah
Give it here, and don't say nuthin'
Just give it here, and don't say nuthin'
Cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin'
Nigga, give it here, and don't say nuthin'

Yeah, it ain't nothin' like I rush I get, in front of the band
On stage wit the planet in the palm of my hand
When a brother transform, from aynonomous man
To the force, crush whoever might of thought I was playin'
I'ma flame some, sentence the shit, the cold twist to slang
Thicker than big boy baby, mom, sister pain
Beyond measure, relaxed under pressure
You see the master piece, but to me it's unperfected
Give it here Geffen Records, I'm off the handle
Cut the check, and yo it better be as heavy as anvil
Next joint comin', all bets is canceled
Nigga black ink, red was a G financial
We finna have the whole industry at a stand still
See me put the system on lock like can pill
So get wit them endorsements, and call reinforcements
Cause my click come a full sizable portions

Yeah
Give it here, and don't say nuthin'
Just give it here, and don't say nuthin'
Cut the check
Give it here, and don't say nuthin'
Nigga, give it here, and don't say nuthin'

Check it out, yo yo, S-P uncut 
Yo yo, what P-5-D uncut, yeah yeah it's that Philly shit 
Yo yo, check it out, yo yo 

You Don't See Us, but we see you 
You stuck on sleep, get on your P's and Q's 
'Cause you will get crept, wit no discrept 
You know the rep, we keep the flows in check 

Mesmerizing, state of the art caffeine 
It's over head like Omni-verse screen 
I'm not the average savage that curse queens 
I'm something from his worst dreams 

First we handling first things, I'm subsurface unseen 
Grat'll hold planet by purse strings 
MC's are earthlings, not built to hurt things 
Speaking the words of weaklings, nothing but sweet things 

Man each world, it ain't no time to recline 
Act up, get clapped up, my mind is the nine 
Shine like jewels that spark, swimming with sharks 
Never caught speaking to NARC's, that's weak in the parks 

I'm the type to sit back and analyze the prize 
Grip it up and flee the scene wit a different disguise 
Take a detour, I be all that I can be whore 
Talkin' to this bitch life, had to make her my wife 

Live twice, got seven more lives to live 
I'm all out, takin' things to the fullest extent 
Help me get it down and we can split one-hundred percent 
Run a rapper through a maze like a experiment 
Word up, you know the legendary Roots crew, yo 

 

The Raw Dice rise like a creature from out the swamp 
Wit my blood-thirsty clergy that's on the hunt for conk 
Who pumps your heart, I made you want to rhyme from the start 
You should be more alert, then you wouldn't get hurt 

Get off your horse and on your P's and beware 
Of images you seein', did deceiving, you're scared 
And even more shook up than the scenes that's near 
I'm Dice Raw, sting the inside of your mouth like a cold sore 

Who want to piece, well it's Round One, let's begin 
I got a gun that's don't bust, it just suck niggas in 
I got shit that'll have you begging me to shoot ya 
I'm the professor, you rock a dunce cap, go get a tutor  

Yo, Okay Computer, Radiohead's knock to the future 
Shock like Kurtis, at your service 
None other than, the Fifth governing playin the cut again 
y'all clueless to what the fuck is up again 

Yo, hard times and sufferin' 
What, my peoples in the crevices strugglin' 
'Nuff of them untie soldier thespian 
But I'm from the next e-on, supreme being that's unseen for MC'n 

 

Yo, they all around me 'round me 
On my head, they got a bounty 
I'm tryin' to get this bell up so I can flee your county 
Triple-six, come in my mix, flood it wit tricks 

I'm sharper than rough spoons for icepicks 
Niggas price bricks till dawn, if the money is long 
Cats who play strong will inhale, then go play bong 
You wrong son, you thought I wasn't droppin' a ton 
Sit and think about the way I want to tally a sum 

Ah-yo I sneakfully snuck up from behind and got you 
From over there in them bushes, I chilled and watched you 
Dancin' all dolly as you pussy for them folly 
I knock you out wit one punch from me you been Ali-ed 

I float like hovercrafts and sting like vaccinations 
When my name said out loud, you'll lose your concentration 
Dice Raw, D-I-C-E-R-A-W, you want to take it 
Otherwise, fuck you goin' do? 

That's what I thought, nada, nothing, caput, zero 
Rough as sandpaper but still smooth as a tiptoe 
Raw's takin' over, baby don't tell me you ain't know 
A lot of kids can rap but you fuckin wit the pros 

Ya know what I'm sayin', y'all know the legendary Roots crew, it's like 

We go wow, ba-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall, just sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Runnin one on one and only hip-hop bound
Yo Tariq  how your micraphone sound
 well aight, show em what it's about

We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double  bubble  bubble 

Well it's like smack the track up and leave dents in it
The vocalist, bustin this blunt, instrument spit
The magnificent, rapper's run from it
All fly girls, nipples and toes, numb from it
MC's in my circumference, is confronted son
Get your growth stunted from this, you don't want it
  The Black Thought and M-O-S Def done it
Who the ultimate?  Yo my man speak upon it

Aiyyo I stop fools and drop jewels but never run it
Rock mics so nice I make you stock price plummet
All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane barkin big game and get hunted
Eyewitness account, say it happened so sudden
Just slid off to the side, didn't really say nuttin
Then BLAOW, blew away the 1900th

You better get your rest cause the next day comin
Oh yes, and MC's they scared to say sum'tin
Stop frontin, I'm in the cut just onlookin
Your get your kings, your rooks, rings and pawns tooken

Aiyyo, keep your tape rollin so you catch every bar
of the Black Thought and the black man from Black Star
Illadelph and Vietnam we conference, accomplish
Even with stakes inclined, I get mine, regardless

Yo, a lot of Smurfette MC's carry purses
And rock, uniforms, that's made for nurses
I burst your verses, your words is worthless
Only touchin surface, the FUCK's the purpose?

I shot the sherriff, the deputy, and head of bank treasury
So mounties in the county got a BIG bounty stressin me
But tell 'em to hold off, they too short to measure me
Mos and Black Thought blast forth with the weaponry

Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Yo Tariq  how your micraphone sound
 well aight, show em what it's about

We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double  bubble  bubble 

Yeah, now check your stove top before you take a listen
And make sure beans don't burn in the kitchen
These gassed-up niggaz just ain't fuel efficient
I play the winter breeze to choke hold your piston
 Now you niggaz can't make pole position
Class E chassis can't hold the transmission
Crew pit, useless, they got they tools missin
Watch me, grand prix, champy for wealth driven

Yo, you go one for my hustle 
Two to rock rhyme 
From the muscle kid I'm one of the illets of all time
I swing from chandeliers and wall climb
And specialize in warfares of all kind
A lot of MC's said I'm a run it down rhyme
But half the time, they run it down one of mine
Thought suffocatin em with yet another stunnin line
You dumb and blind kid, it's enlarged and underlined

What I memorized leave your whole staff pressurized
Melt down all of your artificial lies
Y'all niggaz is faker than Yellow No. 5
Swine like mono and diglyceride
My vocals got texture, you just texturized
I'm nicer than your writtens even when I'm improvised
Step into my zone get flown like fly
by the b-boy Lazarus who just won't die

Yo, me and Kamal and Leanord Hubbard, ?uestlove and Malik
We go back to dollar hoagies and Tahitian Treat
Or like toast in the oven with government cheese bubblin
Me and Dante like Marvin, The Troublemen travellin
Give me the mic, we on that again
b-boy business, off the top actin and battlin
Servin them cats that forgot
But don't get too close, because you might get shot

Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Yo Tariq  how your micraphone sound
 well aight, show em what it's about

We bout to blow up the spot, because y'all must have forget
We double  bubble  bubble 

We go blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Went from _Do You Want More?!??!!_ to what you want now?

Yo Tariq  how your micraphone sound
 well aight, show em what it's about

We bout to blow up the spot, because y'all must have forget
We double  bubble  bubble 

Say here's a little story that must be told
About two young brothers who got so much soul
They takin total control, of the body and brain
Flyin high in the sky, on a lyrical plane
It's just two bad brothers who will never quit
Mos Def and Tariq from the 2-1-5th
They rock beginnin to end, on a spiritual blend
And everybody who forgot then baby tell em again
It's just me and Tariq, with Ahmir on the beat
The Roots crew baby yo we got to make it unique
We got the soul-shockinest, body-rockinest
Non-stoppinest, Fortified Live survive the apocalypse
Rhymes we say, the perfect blend
Because we know how to rock when the beat come in
Like zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Zen zen-zen, ZEN zen zen ZEN zen zen
Zen zen, ZEN zen zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen, ZEN zen ZEN zen
Here we go, here we here we here we go
Zen zen-zen, ZEN zen zen ZEN zen zen
Zen zen, ZEN zen zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Let the poppers pop, and the breakers break
Then zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Zen zen, ZEN zen, zen-zen zen-zen...

We go wow, ba-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall, just sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Runnin one on one and only hip-hop bound
Yo Tariq  how your micraphone sound

We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double  bubble  bubble 

Well it's like smack the track up and leave dents in it

All fly girls, nipples and toes, numb from it

All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane barkin big game and get hunted
Eyewitness account, say it happened so sudden
Just slid off to the side, didn't really say nuttin
Then BLAOW, blew away the 1900th

You better get your rest cause the next day comin
Oh yes, and MC's they scared to say sum'tin
Stop frontin, I'm in the cut just onlookin
Your get your kings, your rooks, rings and pawns tooken

Aiyyo, keep your tape rollin so you catch every bar
of the Black Thought and the black man from Black Star
Illadelph and Vietnam we conference, accomplish
Even with stakes inclined, I get mine, regardless

Yo, a lot of Smurfette MC's carry purses
And rock, uniforms, that's made for nurses
I burst your verses, your words is worthless
Only touchin surface, the FUCK's the purpose?

I shot the sherriff, the deputy, and head of bank treasury
So mounties in the county got a BIG bounty stressin me
But tell 'em to hold off, they too short to measure me
Mos and Black Thought blast forth with the weaponry

Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Yo Tariq  how your micraphone sound
 well aight, show em what it's about

We got to blow up the spot, because they must have forget
We double  bubble  bubble 

Yeah, now check your stove top before you take a listen
And make sure beans don't burn in the kitchen
These gassed-up niggaz just ain't fuel efficient
I play the winter breeze to choke hold your piston
 Now you niggaz can't make pole position
Class E chassis can't hold the transmission
Crew pit, useless, they got they tools missin
Watch me, grand prix, champy for wealth driven

Yo, you go one for my hustle 
Two to rock rhyme 
From the muscle kid I'm one of the illets of all time
I swing from chandeliers and wall climb
And specialize in warfares of all kind
A lot of MC's said I'm a run it down rhyme
But half the time, they run it down one of mine
Thought suffocatin em with yet another stunnin line
You dumb and blind kid, it's enlarged and underlined

What I memorized leave your whole staff pressurized
Melt down all of your artificial lies
Y'all niggaz is faker than Yellow No. 5
Swine like mono and diglyceride
My vocals got texture, you just texturized
I'm nicer than your writtens even when I'm improvised
Step into my zone get flown like fly
by the b-boy Lazarus who just won't die

Yo, me and Kamal and Leanord Hubbard, ?uestlove and Malik
We go back to dollar hoagies and Tahitian Treat
Or like toast in the oven with government cheese bubblin
Me and Dante like Marvin, The Troublemen travellin
Give me the mic, we on that again
b-boy business, off the top actin and battlin
Servin them cats that forgot
But don't get too close, because you might get shot

Like blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Brace yourself, it's about to go down

Yo Tariq  how your micraphone sound
 well aight, show em what it's about

We bout to blow up the spot, because y'all must have forget
We double  bubble  bubble 

We go blaow-ba-dow-da-da-dow-da-dah-ow
Either stand tall or sit the fuck down
All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Went from _Do You Want More?!??!!_ to what you want now?

Yo Tariq  how your micraphone sound
 well aight, show em what it's about

We bout to blow up the spot, because y'all must have forget
We double  bubble  bubble 

Say here's a little story that must be told
About two young brothers who got so much soul
They takin total control, of the body and brain
Flyin high in the sky, on a lyrical plane
It's just two bad brothers who will never quit
Mos Def and Tariq from the 2-1-5th
They rock beginnin to end, on a spiritual blend
And everybody who forgot then baby tell em again
It's just me and Tariq, with Ahmir on the beat
The Roots crew baby yo we got to make it unique
We got the soul-shockinest, body-rockinest
Non-stoppinest, Fortified Live survive the apocalypse
Rhymes we say, the perfect blend
Because we know how to rock when the beat come in
Like zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Zen zen-zen, ZEN zen zen ZEN zen zen
Zen zen, ZEN zen zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen, ZEN zen ZEN zen
Here we go, here we here we here we go
Zen zen-zen, ZEN zen zen ZEN zen zen
Zen zen, ZEN zen zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Let the poppers pop, and the breakers break
Then zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Zen zen, ZEN zen, zen-zen zen-zen...

Yea we gettin' ready to break y'all it's winner take all
The game is locked we down to the eight ball
The time is now, it ain't nothin' to wait for
I'm a king by blood a soldier by nature
I'm somethin' like a threat to y'all space cadets
Cause you never met brother nothin' like me yet
So push another slice into your toast and tighten your vests
Cause it's a warrior you seein' here tonight in the flesh
I give you somethin' high voltage double dosage
Runnin' with these vultures givin' me ulcers
Which one of these hustlers bringin' the thunder
'Riq Geez not another man takin' us under
Nigga please which Philly cat doin' his own thing
Might say black my give you a code name
Round my neck see the microphone hang
Have your lady lips singin' like on soul train
The niggaz that's a problem is minimal margin
The Colonel, Captain, Lieutenant, General Sergeant
Black, one man army move in on your squadron
You sittin' still you know you a target
You heard you better duck down!

See me comin' better tuck those chains
Cause you don't wanna feel them thangs
If you want it, you can get it baby
You know you need to get low
Duck Down! 
See me comin' better tuck those chains
Cause you don't wanna feel them thangs
If you want it, you can get it baby
You know you need to get low
Duck Down! 

Yea we gettin' set to get rid of y'all that's what it's headin' for
The underdog knuckle and brawl with the bigger ball
I spit what your wig absorb sicker than sycamore
I'm creatin' a circumstance that you a victim of
The rebel or the renegade out on the quest
The super black man runnin' wit a S on his chest
And stand for the straight struggle to escape the stress
You think it's sweet tryin' to eat, you ain't taste this yet
So make y'all steps precautious into the darkness
Thoughts cold and heartless makin' me nauseous
Gettin' more remorses for what I done
If the lawyers and courts wonder what I run
You see the liberty is free but just for some
How you a gangster and you scared to bust your gun
For the call, trust your fam' and trust nobody at all
Seein' brothers gettin' struck down
You better duck down!

See me comin' better tuck those chains
Cause you don't wanna feel them thangs
If you want it, you can get it baby
You know you need to get low
Duck Down! 
See me comin' better tuck those chains
Cause you don't wanna feel them thangs
If you want it, you can get it baby
You know you need to get low
Duck Down! 

I can feel somethin' for sure, I've been up in here before
A gladiator in a colliseum ready for war
That old timer holdin' his revolver set to blow
Just like a gladiator at whoever stick his head in the door
And one who been through it all, anything go
Rather give it to you straight 'stead of speakin in codes
'Cause man, that bullshit can get you riddled with holes
If you ain't insured than the hospitals is close
You got to go up-town while ya leakin' on the ground
In cases like these, you need to duck down
You're five dollar toys, I'm a million dollar man
Esquire 'Riq Geez go according to plan
I'm thinkin' outside the box, off the blocks
An outside your concept of time, off the clocks for real
Well it's Black Thought your boss DJ
However you brothers weigh that's what ya gonna pay

See me comin' better tuck those chains
Cause you don't wanna feel them thangs
If you want it, you can get it baby
You know you need to get low
Duck Down! 
See me comin' better tuck those chains
Cause you don't wanna feel them thangs
If you want it, you can get it baby
You know you need to get low
Duck Down!

Yo, to rock this mic is like a basic instinct
But yo in-in-tro-tro-duc-ducing

Behind thee, the mic champ-ion
More than a step-ion
Mothafuckers sweatin' me, beggin' me just to get me on
Macro-cosmic, micro-master

Ey yo I'm all the way way, Phil Phil-lay-lay
People want to see the way the Illadel play
Yo, look in the mirror, watch what yourself say
I'm from S-P, no mortal man can test me
Thought, I keep a lin-e in, upper eschulone-in
Heineken, hold the rhymin' in, flows remindin' 'em
Cats that hear me up, some shit from back in the past
Your half-steppin' ass, could never fathom a grasp because 

Yo we got a doctrine, in cold-rockin' it
Bringin' this apocalypse, nigga you mad topical
Bitch my raps trick your optical
Mister superficial, I'm rippin' apart your heart tissue
This is your official, dismissal
I don't study the artificial, who fuckin' wit the dark crystal
Yo where are is you? I'm movin' like a smart missile
Aimed and guaranteed to hit you

Word up, but when the Fifth do get on and perform, you in for it
It ain't no way to cen-sor it, my style metaphoric
To bricks and ten tons stacks hard to lift
The artist, comin' out the Fifth darkness

We go back like ancients, while you ain't shit
Sub-terrainean, never against the grain-ean
Afro-American slash half-blade-ean
In your universe, my star's the most radiant

Ey yo it's all the way live, from 2-1-5
Plus admission is denied so just wait outside
Two extremes collide like Jekyl and Hyde
And I provie you wit the swerve you need, but take heed
You travellin' like speed
Iller than adventures you might read
O-fficial original breed, the just-ice league, yo it's the P-5-D
Style fashionist, other MC's they actresses

Yo it's the high-opposed, you bout to get shot down
Tryin' to fly above this Illa-Fifth compound
You've known since the get-go, I rock your disco
Ain't nobody badder, but yo you get my gist so
I represent so you gotta squint
As far as how I do it you ain't compen-sate
We causin' nui-sance and get in-decent so save your two cents
Don't come in my district, kickin' that bullshit

Yo it's all simplistic, limited click get
Lyrically lifted, touchin' the Fifth shit
Trenches of the mentally twisted, you enlisted
Five was the emblem on the mic you got hit wit

And I stomp ya, till you call me conqueror
Back-slappin' all the niggas that slept
Thinkin' that Elo could ever disappear
I'm strippin' they vi near
Wit this non ether reefer, quiet frequent premiere

Better believe it, cause it is coming
You won't believe the site you see before eyes

Just push the panic button on your remote control
Then enter the zone where our patrolers will get round cold soul
Diddly Bo leave for feelin' a saga foretold
Who got caught pon the block for gold got the old
Heads froze, they peepin' outta closed windows
They not secure as they supposed I watched it all unfold
Well this another episode with titanic panoramic view is dismantle
Depressin' um, load with this gun hold
Wild like a sun sold for cash
Guns traded for sensi and hash crack for ass
Entire crews pass not making the news flash
Brews pass a memory and spark not to blast
Whatever have transform to the war path
Pure wrath from north down to 24th and Task
Games store the half the niggas you were prayin the streets
Tainted with camouflage, guerrilla sabotage
My cousin's da ratatard was livin tight large
Got caught then blast crashed off on Broad and Lambar
So many so called hearts scared they buried in the yard
Lick shots at Babylon de one comfy bombard
Kids run far from traditional credit cards scams
Veterans is nipped in the butt with large plans
Stick up kids is jumpin' outta played the Dodge Rams to jam
You and your man it's mad drama and

Better believe it, cause it is coming
You won't believe the site you see before eyes

This is for all of my niggas that are RIP
You ain't missin' of life ain't what this should be
I pass a car soon you know who's the enemy
Lots of shit has changed and it's kinda fucked up to see
You remember Top see nigga think slice of dream
Yo I'm fast for the buck do anything for the cream
Never seen a case like this although it's quite contagious
He even got his little bother actin' all outrageous
From dusk to dawn and from dawn back to dusk
They do anything and everything tryin to come up
It's kinda sickenin' how the cash is so fucking addicted
And when I say some bout they say that that's conflicted
Ain't nothin' but a contradiction in this world we live in
Cause the loot is for the takin' and not for the givin'
Then ya got this world well I say I'ma die hustlin'
Fuck everybody except my brother who I'm trusted in
I guess the couple just did not know the truth
Cause the following week I seen threw him of the roof
And sometimes I wonder what the fuck I think about that
How nowadays kids get whap for somethin' less than a pat
But I guess that's how it goes when there ain't no more rap
Thought he was his brothers keep but fuck all that
Niggas causin' mayhem from the p.m.'s to a.m.'s
Americas worst nightmare guns against hands

Better believe it, cause it is coming
You won't believe the site you see before eyes

It was the year of '84 I was tryin ta get in the mix
The year the niggas roll with sheepskins gazelles and kicks
Even got the patten leather Adidas snatched of your feet
Man that talk is cheap the crippled can't walk for weeks
The first sto was word to Penn and Teller's
Strolled in the dollar house parties and search for Cinderella
Was just a little man real bold
Tryin to act grown and old so da respect can be shown
A Hip Hop a little copped in and break dancing
When niggas wore wind breakers plot to take lamb skins
Remember Zigglers? Uptown the bottom to Natrona and
St. Charles in South Phil the ooh mob gang
H-are-M Ogontz Ave. Brickyard to hollow
Niggas was snatching gazzeles and flipping pockets for the dallo
You run ya little wolf chain in West Oak Lane
And niggas from Logan came to extort we know the game
You proclaim this gangster bullshit talk
And never even seen your man shot a bodies in charge
Aggravated assault another weekend in the precinct
Take everybody for their ring man that's how we think
Back then you catch a sucker punch off guard
Niggas will pull you card trying to walk around all hard
Niggas quick to flip your pockets if you lip service
When you see fifty niggas deep with Scully's get nervous
It ain't no telling what they could do to you
So you clutch up thinking you knowing you getting stuck up
In another episode in my area code

It's another episode in my area code

America's lost somewhere inside of Littleton
Eleven million children are on Ritalin
That's way I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin'
False media, we don't need it, do we?
Pilgrims, Slaves, Indian, Mexican
It looks real fucked up for your next of kin
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin'
False media

If I can't work to make it, I'll rob and take it
Either that or me and my children are starving and naked
Rather be a criminal pro than to follow the Matrix
Hey it's me a monster y'all done created
I've been inaugurated
Keep the bright lights out of our faces
You can't shake it, it ain't no way to swallow the hatred
Aim, fire, holla about a dollar, nothin' in sacred
We gone pimp, the shit out of nature
Send our troops to get my paper
Tell 'em stay away from them skyscrapers
Ain't long for you get y'all acres
I'ma show 'em who's the global gangster
Sentence me to four more years, thank you
I'ma make you feel a little bit safer
Because it ain't over
See that's how we get your fear to control you
But ain't nobody under more control than the soldier
And how could you expect a kid to keep his composure
When all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure again

False media, we don't need it, do we 

This is a game, I'm your specimen
You've got to let me know baby
So I can go, I'd have to fake it
I could not make it
You could not take it

Yeah, where I'ma start it at, look I'ma part of that
Downtown Philly where it's realer than a heart attack
It wasn't really that ill until the start of crack
Now it's a body caught every night on the Almanac
Rock bottom where them cops gotta problem at
Where them outsiders getting popped for they wallet at
I had nothin' but I made somethin' outta that
Now I'm the first out the limo like Charlie Mack
From 215 it's him the livest one
And he's representin' Philly to the fullest
Blacks the realest
You can't touch him and not for nothin'
If you bout hip hop then you gots to love it
If not then fuck it
I'm still handlin'
Smokin' more reefer than Redman and them damaging MC's
And my name's Rick Gees you endangered species
For what I do I'm about to up the fees
I'm paper-chase motivated I ain't the one to play with
These cats get set ablaze
You can't have it y'all way but I'd rather parlay
Just smoke OG and get cabbage all day
The way thought play causes your main thing to say
Your style so splendid you bout your business
You arousing my interests
You sharper than a Shogun
You know the way it go, huh, game know what I'm talkin' bout

Hus, that's short for hustlers
We Black Inc Raw Life productions
Tryin' to find our spota amongst the ruckus
And be sucker free, flea chumps and busters
Man yeah, Get 'em hus, get 'em hus, get 'em hus

Hey yo I'm tryin' to get it at any cost so it's no remorse
When I'm blastin' off like you been askin' for it
When Black step in the door all hats is off
Your hands up in the air goin' back and forth
I'm about ready for a classic massacre
I'll make it hotter than when Shaft in Africa
Jump outta a black Porsche huffin' a fat cigar
Night ridin' on 'em like my last name Hasselhoff
Voted unlikely to succeed cause my class was full
Of naysayers, cheaters and thieves
All it gave me was a good enough reason to leave
And put the writing on the wall for y'all to read it and weep
Cause I'm the force of the Lord, the rage of hell
You'd rather head for the hills and save yourselves
My Man rip drums like He ringin' the bells
The King of the Realm you seen Him do His thing in a film
Come on

Hus, that's short for hustlers
We Black Inc Raw Life productions
Tryin' to find our spota amongst the ruckus
And be sucker free, flea chumps and busters
Man yeah, Get 'em hus, get 'em hus, get 'em hus

Dreams when M16's with infrared beams
Blowin' up presidents' cribs with cans of kerosene
High-jack the limousine with a strategic routine
Then blast my enemy, head for the Caribbean
Militant guerrilla camp is ready for war
Lay your corner face down, place down your jewels cash and four four
When I score prepare for torture
Fuck around and make your town Warsaw
I'm from Illadel the land where the killas dwell
My technique is to ambush you guerrilla style
My instinct is of a killer whale bang you up from head to toe
With lyrics I pack like a nine millimal
My types subliminal mentality switched to criminal
Importing heroin internash from Senegal
A soldier takes a stripes from a general
Used the mike of iron or lead
You choose your mineral

This is a game, I'm your specimen
You've got to let me know baby
So I can go, I'd have to fake it
I could not make it
You could not take it

Look my squad's half mandrill half Mandela
My band bout seventy strong just like fela
Yeah part Melly Mel part Van Halen
And we represent illadel where they still rebellin'
A yo sicko show like mike moore's
My city ain't nothing like your's
Slippin' into darkness like war! night-crawl
With the lights off, you see a lot of life loss for the white horse
Regardless, the charges makin' us all targets
All on the red carpet, guns from the black market
Hey who got the politicians in they back pocket
Pimp slap pump that gimme that profit
When you make contact gimme that gossip
If you break contract you'll be that hostage
They getting busy in the city it's raw
Better deadbolt the door it ain't safe no more

Southside get busy yall
Northside get busy yall
Westside get busy yall
Worldwide get busy yall

Approach with caution be cautious when talking to bosses
I feel I've been through a metamorphosis
I'm mutated by unknown forces
The feelin' of course is something thats hard to describe I'm half dead never felt more alive
Reborn removed the gold coins from my eyes
I've been down but now I'm back up
Bout to act up boy you better back up
When you see me set up shop know to pack up
I crack up when a rapper gets slapped up
Number one reason yall should give rap up
Dice it's mine, I got it all wrapped up
I'm kinda W.E.B. Dubois meets Heavy D and the boys smooth as a Rolls Royce
Built like a tank smoking on dank
I'm walking through the Guggenheim Raw Life Black Ink

Southside get busy yall
Northside get busy yall
Westside get busy yall
Worldwide get busy yall

Now on your mark get set
Go cop everything you ever heard by P.Crack Dice Raw and Black
Fuck the internet buy a baseball bat break a bootlegger
Leg all I listen to is vets, your fresh of the step
I come directly at your OG neck
I'm used to the one two check not the one two step
Um strapped I'll leave every cat among you wet
Now lets go! you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show I start it with a can I get a ho and the hoes go retarded
The popo tape off the stage for caution, its badlands north philly get it in!
Its crack man, used to backspin now I spend stacks in sack's and
Uncle Sam tryin' to tax all my hard earned raps damn!
We makin' yin, pesos, euros, we representin'

Southside get busy yall
Northside get busy yall
Westside get busy yall
Worldwide get busy yall

 
You live, you die
And spend the years in between asking the question
Why you've been through what you been
You lose, you win
You even pay for other sins
But you most always adore the skin you are in

I woke up and it was pouring down rain
I put my head on, it really wasn't no thing
One of them days I was feeling immune to the pain
Threw on, Alice Coltrane, smoked and sang

And wrote this flame compused to the rhythm of the droplets
And went whispering simliar to gossip
The kick slapping at the window glass
Slow down the globe so it don't spin too fast

Because, I been running like a river since
The age of my early innocence
It just made me ambitious
My grams used to tell me "Man listen,

If you can't burn, don't step into the kitchen"
You muscle your turn, the laws of the land viscious
We gotta stick to the plan, which is
Pursuing true riches, whether we trade stock or wash dishes

Throughout setbacks and few glitches
The Big Picture's the focus, fuckin being hopeless
Or helpless, we not selfish so we wrote this
Give it to ya, make you feel good
Know what I'm talkin about? C'mon

Yo from the parquet floors to the fifty foot ceiling
I pull the heavy black curtain back, now revealing
The sun beneath the velvet, and like it was mine

No one elses, embracing the beams yo, I felt it
And stood there, feeling it, getting charged
Turn me loose upon the streets, a young poet at large
Out in the world, up against tremendous odds

Some'll let it break em and throw in they cards
But my squad remain focus when we goin for ours
And we don't, do it for chains or do it for cars
And we don't, do it for lames or do it for broads

And we don't, do it for fame, we do it because
It's for the young black gifted mind
Living the story of the most twisted kind
Turbulent times swirled around they dome like a turban

It gets disturbing, feelin alone in the urban
But maintain ya grip for just a little bit
I'd tell you it's all good but that's bullshit
Let's just try to feel good, yeah...know what I'm talkin bout

A spirit knows we're meant to blow
A  rose by the seat of your soul
You past it all and seeds your soul
Are destined to grow even after you go

Peace to all the hip cats, all the nappy sweets 
This is the Brother Question, broadcasting live 
Via satellite, from the Never Never Tunnels 
Now dig the rituals for today, is good music 
So sit back, relax and dig the groove 

Yo bust it, I digs hip-hop, and rocks for hip-hop 
Not R&B because to me that's not my style and 
The are-double-O-quotes ain't for radio, but major soul 
The ones that's hip won't change the dial and 
I remember one morning at the Soul Shack, coolin' 
In the outback, on the songwritin' ship 
Blizz a five, off a Bob Marley spliff 
On the cloud I be relaxin' from last night and shit 
In studio today but hey Brother Question 
Was on the Westside asleep without a clue when 
I hollered down to Crumbs to pick up the phone 
And tell him to get ready  
 Yeah
Buttered chicken wings, so I met him in the West 
Where we had to 'lax and wait for Rubber Band and Bes' 
Bassey broke down on the other side of town 
Yo you know what it's about, The Roots is out 
To the subway 

Does anybody like real music? 
Sweet music, soul music? 
You know The Roots is a group that'll choose it 
Just to use it, to make you move it, yeah 
Does anybody like real music? 
Sweet music, soul music? 
You know The Roots is a group that'll choose it 
Just to use it, to make you move it, yeah 

From the subway to the studio 
Gots to break fast if we want to get, to the bus 
Runnin' like a Mex for the border 
 
Nah, just the four of us 
Nuff nappy sweets on the transit, two fine 
 fo' five mo' fine, uhh! 

A girl says, "Hey ain't y'all The Square Roots?" 
And I'm like, "Heh, word," 
And then the shorty passed the sign 
Now we got to make out exit  
To the pavement  Crushin' trail mix 
 Say what?  
Question dropped a whole bag of drumsticks 
 but a chicken wing, so 
He bends down to pick up the sticks 
And his pants fall down  
In my face, Question didn't frown, turned around 
And thought he felt a draft, so I laughed 
 

Does anybody like real music? 
Sweet music, soul music? 
You know The Roots is a group that'll choose it 
Just to use it, to make you move it, yeah 
Does anybody like real music? 
Sweet music, soul music? 
You know The Roots is a group that'll choose it 
Just to use it, to make you move it, yeah 

Here comes the Crumbs, from the chums of the P.O. 
Sprouted from The Roots and I was added to the trio 
Now I'm in cahoots and got a reason for my ego 
In the words of, Los Lobos, adios, amigo 

At the Rat Cave, mic I'm hand, I'm flowin' 
Tellin Question, to keep it, goin' 
What I'm doin', I'm not really knowin' 
But umm, to me see it sounds oh-and-kay'n  
Layin', to the sounds playin' 
Um, hi to hoe and, yeah, hey to hay'n  
Trippin', I'm tryin', not to laugh, bust it 
It's the last paragraph, and I'm done half 
But Question's jokin', and I'm like hopin' 
That nobody comes in and opens, the door
(Ah man, what is up with you man? 
I'm leavin', what why you scratchin' your face like that man? 
Look ugly, self-righteous, do-gooder) 

Does anybody like real music? 
Sweet music, soul music? 
You know The Roots is a group that'll choose it 
Just to use it, to make you move it, yeah 
Does anybody like realmusic? 
Sweet music, soul music? 
You know The Roots is a group that'll choose it

Yo Malik Blunt
 Whassup?
Tell me how you like your grits man
 Man I like ALL KINDS of grits son
I just don't like them sticky grits
Word, that was trippy
Whassup with you Black Thought man, wassup?
 Word, organix, groovy stew grits
with cheese, and mad honey
That ain't nuttin man!
 That's the grits that needs cash man!
I like my grits with sugar man
 I like them with BUTTER
Sweet and smooth man

Who gets the grits?  Bust it
I can tell another bout real grits getters
Gettin grits y'all  Bust it, let a
brother tell another bout real grits getters

Who gets the grits?  Bust it, let a
brother tell another bout real grits getters

Who gets the grits?  Bust it, let a
brother tell another about the real grits getters

Who gets the grits?  Bust it, let a
brother tell another bout the grits getter

Now me, I'm out to get the grits, more than a little bit
If I said, "Don't get it Black," you know I'd be a hypocrite
Levels often fluctuate to surplus from deficit
Rated with the X, is the X-tra X-plicit grits
I, slides, AND, slips, AND, dives, AND, dips
into it, it being grits that I gets like a quaker
But take the raincoats, for the oats
When you crush trail mix yo, I dig my grits fixed slow
with butter, you slip up in the grits and make em other
Some people call it skins but, grits is the other term
that you gots to learn, to keep up on all the scoop
I get a little ends but, never spends loot
for the wiggle, some immature, kids like to laugh
so they giggle for the grits and, when they get close
they start skitz-in, not this kid, because I switched in
flipped in, changed the position that I hits in-side
I glide, words can't describe, how I move be
like, hittin a doobie, Thought'll get ya groovy, so!
Yo Black, here's a bit of advice:
your wife's nice so you better keep the girls away
from the grits getter

Who gets the grits?  Bust it, let a
brother tell another about the real grits getters

* repeat 4X w/ minor variations *

Yeah I likes to unzip it, strip it then grip it
To be specific I won't like it, so get the ticket
Flip it like it was a coin, put the loins in the groins
In other words the groins I stretch, now you gets the sketch
You, know I use my mark like the worm on Noah's Ark
But if I happen to see a spark, I umm, parks my bark
Guess I haves to rest my num before the next number to sum
But so I can't slumber or sleep, my shovel's diggin deep
Peep this hick whose name was Vickie
Gettin tricky rather slicky
Her performance showed endurance
She said, "Me like to licky licky"
Body more gracious, or should I say bodacious
Took my order then she sorta served me
like she was a waitress
Never will I say that she was tasteless

Maker of the pastry, so's I calls her pastress
Still enthused, cause I got my cruise on
P-O-L-O blues on, when I choose to move I puts my shoes on
Protection, against infection
Erect projections travels South in your mouth
like a dentist checked in, commence to be intent
She said, "I can't understand you, but damn you like Prince"
I make it feel like a Zulu, from Honolulu
By the way she roll away like a dog who name was Ubu
They also said the way I entered from the center
is adventurous, imprint on you dentures when I bust
or I thrust, Mid-Atlantic, they act like a schitzophrenic
Sometimes they panic like I'm Diggin on a Planet
I don't gotta Beama or a Jetta, ?C-ka-Reama alla netta?
Malik is the sleek grits, getter

Who gets the grits?  Bust it, let a
brother tell another about the real grits getters

* repeat 4X w/ minor variations *

I would be lyin if I told you I could not
prepare a fat bowl of sticky, grits for a quickie
Humans get picky, and judge it by the thickness
But if it bends your spoon then add some butter with the quickness
I might get a bit smoother, if you move it to a
better, position, that's probably what she wishin
You can add some groovy spices, to give it extra
But my advice is to first let it simmer
Hot, if it's hot then let the pot sit and cool
Cause if you spill your milk, we label you beginner
Humans gotta know, that I keep my bowl, full of grits
Swingin with their daughters while their parents throwin fits
Tellin me to change my diet plan, to bran cereal
Or rice, I tried that twice, it didn't work
In fact, it made my milk kinda sour
Half and half, part creamer, and skeemer
That's why if it's grits then it gotta be organic
Cause if it's artificial, I panic

Who gets the grits?  Bust it, let a
brother tell another about the real grits getters

* repeat 4X w/ minor variations *

Yo man, what about me man?
* everybody clowns *
Yo man, just pass your grits down man

Who gets the grits, now let me tell ya
A plenty posse bloom from the cellar, to nail ya
daughter or your sister, the younger skins elixir
Kick a cat, but I won't like a cat, I'll figure
I'd rather, play the thigh kisser, sister,
I don't die swift, and yo I'm not a quitter
So umm, let me place my hands upon that waist and trace
my way to the right nip and left nip then sip
Similac, until my Jimmy grows fat, grab my pack of hats
from the back, then flee, to the next block
to knock off socks, yo you know my props
So father, don't bother
Cause once the grits is hot, yo they're good as got

Who gets the grits?  Bust it, let a
brother tell another about the real grits getters

* repeat 4X w/ minor variations *

Yeah it would be cool it could be too
Stop running round in circles off of what we fuel
Living a lie eventually believing it's true
A lot of people here for us one could be you
It's outrageous and they just ain't nothing
But save us an ocean of brown fists in various flavors
A favor for a favor man, this is the majors
Tell me what you would do with no phone or pagers
No Kinko's, no Fed Ex and no ATM's
What you gone do when the police state vegin
Well it already began but I guess it depends on what's really going on
what's happening, huh
Military target practicing
They finna write another patriot act again
The days is short the nights is long
The fight goes on
The pistol and the pipes are drawn

The middle of the night
We fight like barbarians
In sight of the former might
You might think that it's a waste
Of our time
And I think you would be right
Till he drop that rhyme

And some might say that it's a waste of time
Cause ain't no amount of dancing finna break the bondage
We go to war and transcend space and time
When every record ain't a record just to shake behinds
You know the stakes is high we in the face of drama
That's why we can't shake it or escape the problem
Its like a game of roulette the barrel revolving
They only want to see us occupying a coffin
Mothers crying too often from they lost child leaving
From trying to get over, get under, get even
Get inside getting, getting dumped, getting greedy
We got to get it right
It ain't about to be easy
You better pull you goggles up, it's about to get greasy
Believe it's on as long as we can still speak freely
Pages of my life would make it hard to read me
I know my people hearing me, holler it you hear me

The middle of the night
We fight like barbarians
In sight of the former might
You might think that it's a waste
Of our time
And I think you would be right
Till he drop that rhyme

Cold, cold eyes upon me they stare
People all around me and they're all in fear
They don't seem to want me but they won't admit
I must be some kind of creature up here having fits

From my party house, I'm afraid to come outside
Although I'm filled with love I'm afraid they'll hurt my pride
So I play the part I feel they want of me
And I pull the shades so I won't see them seein' me

Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found

From my party house I feel like meetin' others
Familiar faces, creed and race, a brother

But to my surprise I find a man corrupt
Although he be my brother, he wants to hold me up

Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found

In this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found
Havin' hard times, in this crazy town
Havin' hard times, there's no love to be found

Uh I'm soul brother one hunted
How much charisma could another one stomach?
If I be the prisoner then I wasn't more cunning or wise
If I come outside I'm not running
Stone lone wolf of the pack, the unwanted
I really got nothin to hide, I'm bout cuttin
Go out in a blaze, wouldn't pop one button
I'm a murk half hurt leave the cop dogs huntin
The pretty black one in the group
The smooth villain under fire
Cause I'm pennin the words that move millions
Slide right in front of your eyes true brilliance
It's a new bad moon on the rise, who feelin it
New true skill in it

In front of an audience
Disturbing the peace
And the local ordinance
This pimp shit popping

Money long like the arms on Alonzo Mourning
Vampire chicks suck blood
Dusk to dawnin
Waitin to catch me sleep
But I'm not yawnin

Behind the organ

Move with hardness

Floss and force my entry
This peninitentiary
Knockin niggas for centuries
It's elementary
Like KRS and evidently
Incidents

Chill in Harlem
Bang you

Blow your flesh out

Uh, uh
Uh, uh-huh

Out in the streets where I grew up
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care

How I got over where the people come apart
Don't nobody care about you; only thing you got is God
Out here in these streets if you get down on your luck
You can stand out with a hand out, but nobody give a fuck
Out here in these streets every man is for himself
They ain't helpin' no one else; it's a hazard to your health
Livin' life in these cold streets
Hey, who's worryin' 'bout you, babe
When you whylin' out, runnin' 'round in these streets?

Out in the streets where I grew up 
First thing they teach us is not to give a fuck 
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere 
Someone has to care

Yo, when you on the corner, it's too much drama
Livin' with the police right behind ya
It's always more than a slight reminder
We livin' in a war zone like Rwanda
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father
Pray for me if it ain't too much bother
Whatever don't break me or make me stronger
I feel like I can't take too much longer
It's too much lyin' and too much flyin'
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up cryin'
They all got a sales pitch I ain't buyin'
They tryin' to convince me that I ain't tryin'
We uninspired, we un-admired
And tired and sick of being sick and tired
Of livin' in the hood where the shots are fired
We dyin' to live, so to live we dyin'
You just like I am

Out on the streets where I grew up 
First thing they teach us is not to give a fuck 
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere 
Someone has to care

Somebody's gotta care
And I swear it isn't fair
In suspended animation, we ain't tryin' to go nowhere
Out here in these streets
We're so young and all alone
We ain't even old enough to realize we're on our own
Livin' life in these hard streets
Where it's like they lost they mind
Is there anyway to find
Are we runnin' out of time out here?
Listen
Hey, who's worryin' 'bout you, babe
When you whylin' out, runnin' 'round in these streets?

Out on the streets where I grew up 
First thing they teach us is not to give a fuck 
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere 
Someone has to care

Out in the streets where I grew up
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care
Out in the streets where I grew up
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care
Out in the streets where I grew up
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care

Time is gettin' harder and harder
More and more each day, yeah
Still I am determined that I am never gonna change my way

Thinking 'bout love the way it should be
You gotta open your eyes and you will see
About love the way it should be
You gotta make up your minds and you'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity

What happened to the love
That they are all talking about?
It's nothing but useless words
Coming from out of their mouths
Talking 'bout love the way it should be
We gotta open our eyes and we will see
About love the way it should be
We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, 
Yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah 

What happened to the love
That they are all talking about?
It's nothing but useless words
That are coming from out of their mouth
Talking 'bout love the way it should be
Open our eyes and we will see
About love the way it should be
We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, yeah

Listen, people listen

Story of the family biz, I'mma rewrite the script
Daughter of a hip-hopper, hustla like her grandpoppa

Sugar Slim, I'm slicker than a squid, nigga no kids
No baby mama, Sugar free from the drama
Sugar be where he wanna, no sweat like a sauna
No judge, your honor can't tell me to raise mine
Figured that in due time, if and when I do find
True love, Buddha, maybe you can blue-line
Ooh, I'm caught up in the moment for the meantime
G, I'm all about the green like tree pines
See I'm tryin' to get the scratch like a feline
Hopin' that my seed don't know the struggle like me, I'm
Hustlin' to make a buck, make a buck and fuck it up
Fuck it up and suck it up, then go and make another buck

See I'm tryin' to get the scratch like a feline
Hopin' that my seed don't know the struggle like me, I'm
Hustlin' to make a buck, make a buck and fuck it up
Fuck it up and suck it up, then go and make another buck
Get the money, get the money, that's what I know

Hope my baby boy grows up to be a hustla
Better be a hustla, baby be a hustla
If not, then you're only a customer

Let me tell you what priceless is, some advice to give
A sacrifice is what I made for the wife and kids
They say life's a bitch, but it's one life to live
I want my baby where that cake and the icing is
Out of them crisis-es, off of them vices-es
They see what we do and grow up in all likenesses
Really I don't wanna see em having to fight for this
Story of the family biz, I'mma rewrite the script
Daughter of a hip-hopper, hustla like her grandpoppa
Her destiny done been determined so you can't stop her
From being independent, earning paper and proper
More like a lawyer or a doctor, not a man-watcher
That's where your man got ya, it's a big world out yeah
I'm trying to make a black diamond or a pearl out yeah
And hit the people to the way the world twirl out yeah
And when I thank heaven for my little girl

Please let her be a hustla, baby be a hustla
Hope my baby girl grows up to be a hustla
Better be a hustla, baby be a hustla
If not, then you're only a customer
Please let him be a hustla, baby be a hustla
Hope my baby boy grows up to be a hustla
Better be a hustla, baby be a hustla
If not, then you're only a customer

Sugar Slim, I'm slicker than a squid, nigga no kids
No baby mama, Sugar free from the drama
Sugar be where he wanna, no sweat like a sauna
No judge, your honor can't tell me to raise mine
Figured that in due time, if and when I do find
True love, Buddha, maybe you can blue-line
Ooh, I'm caught up in the moment for the meantime
G, I'm all about the green like tree pines
See I'm tryin' to get the scratch like a feline
Hopin' that my seed don't know the struggle like me, I'm

I, I, I can't help it, I, I, I can't help it,
I can't help it, I can't help, I can't help it, I can't help it
I, I, I, I can't help it, I, I, I can't help it,
I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it, I can't help it

Live with it, thats how I survive with it,
Talk jive with, you take dive with it,
Connive with it, depart and arrive with it,
Harsh thrive thats why its part I with it
I did it, make rhymes in 5 minutes,
Mind of a dentist, crimes of the diminished,
Press rewind see what you find in my image,
Take you nigga's back to that line of a scrimmage,
Riq you know we pull a freak with the flow,
Talks cheap thats why we speak with the dough,
Ill techniques sure I'm sleek with the flow,
Its cold outside niggas sleep with the snow,
I tweak in the low tone,freak when the o-zone,
I can't help hiding my seat oh its so known,
I only do what got to because its possible,
And climbing over whatevers known as an obstacle.

I can't help it, maybe I'm selfish,
Maybe the way I'm running is becoming a hell freeze,
All I can see is smoke from tortoise shells that sell shit
50's I feel like I'm making a sales pitch,
My head already so heavy its making the scales tip,
I got my own pressure and got everyones elses,
I'm rehabilitating and still feeling rebellious,
Candidate of heart failure more pills than Elvis,
In a layer cake, half chocolate half velvet,
I'm listening to some howe Melvin,
I got so many options theres so many toxins yo,
Didn't really tell what we killing ourselves with,
I lit a cigarette and then held it,
I'm thinking of some rhymes more illa than a threatin' illment,
I'm on some bomb threat in the mail shit,
Because of all things I dealt with, nigga I can't help it

I never said I'm ready to die, but I accept it,
Never said I"m ready for war, but I'm protected,
I don't even know when its coming but I expect it,
Lost thoughts innocent hopes an now I'm left with
Nervous conditions, addictions, in addition
To prisons that mixed in to the wrong crowd,
My life is on a flight that going down,
My mother had an abortion for the wrong child,
With the time I felt loved, thats gone now,
Thats replaced with purples rays some storm clouds,
Misery love Misery, so why make friends lets make enemies,
An now I got a habit thats wasn't meant for me,
Now I'm in a marriage that wasn't meant to be,
One more reason to change identity,
The cars, the crime, K's, penalties.

I can't help it, I Can't help it
I can't help it, I Can't help it
I, I, I, I can't help it
I, I, I, I, I can't help it

I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'
The drumline bangin' away
Make one move and I'll blow you away
One false move and I'll blow you away
I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'
The drumline bangin' away
Make one move and I'll blow you away
One false move and I'll blow you away

Yo, I don't really know but somebody said
that the O.G. flow, it could fuck with you head
And the police know that the green black and red
too strong to con-trol, they study what I said
Dig it - my name is 'Riq, and when I'm on the mic
I'm known to spit somethin' that these MC's hate
I couldn't care less what you feel what you say
'Cause I gotta put it to you in my own special way - I'm a MONSTER!
You know I'm certified sick
I came from the corner where nobody got shit
Took the cards I was dealt, turned it into hot spit
Now I'm not only a passenger, I'm in the cockpit
Been a long time comin', I was caught in the scramble
of cats, tryin' to do the same thing that they man do
Eagles born to fly, real is made to ramble
"A Dangerous Mind," I'm a prime example

I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'
The drumline bangin' away
Make one move and I'll blow you away
One false move and I'll blow you away
I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'
The drumline bangin' away
Make one move and I'll blow you away
One false move and I'll blow you away

Superfans want to run up on me sparkin' the ground up
You need to fall back, could be NARC's around us
You in a hot area for marchin' powder
If you holdin' chowder, just walk without it
Them real crook brothers don't talk about it
They never make a move 'til they thought shit out kid
I knew a lot of men who did bids for mayhem
They made a lot of money, they money never made them
The game of survival is filled with rivals
Knives and fo'-five slugs flyin' in spirals
The wicked is diseased and it ain't all viral
Could be greed and gluttony bubblin' inside you
Dawg, follow your pride, the rhythm'll guide you
Yo, follow them guys, them niggas will rob you
And have you up in somethin' that don't' really involve you
But you don't give a fuck you want to pump the volume, I know

I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'
The drumline bangin' away
Make one move and I'll blow you away
One false move and I'll blow you away
I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'
The drumline bangin' away
Make one move and I'll blow you away
One false move and I'll blow you away

Yo, ah-yo the waistline thumpin', the face kinda jumpin' the game
Lookin sweeter than a bassline bumpin'
Don't come 'round me sparks and waste time frontin'
Them trick ass marks'll get the eight-five dumpin'
It ain't really bout nothin' - Philly just love cuttin'
They shut shit down before the law start shuttin'
Get your route right cousin - be out nightclubbin' relaxed
And want to get lights out tonight brother, perhaps
It's the percussion that keeps shit, kinetic
For some it ain't as fame, more sweet the street credit
Some cats that play dirty didn't live, to regret it
But move to the music he can live through the record
I'm a Philly boss player, a dope rhyme say-er
It's Black Ink back gettin' cake by the layer
by the stack, comin' at us, get your weight right yeah
If not, you makin' a mistake right there, f orreal

I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'
The drumline bangin' away
Make one move and I'll blow you away
One false move and I'll blow you away
I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'
The drumline bangin' away
Make one move and I'll blow you away
One false move and I'll blow you away
I don't care, as long as the bassline's pumpin'

Make one move and I'll blow you away

I remain calm, lyrically I got the bomb, when you put me on, I remain calm

It's the 'I remain calm' but for jurge to erk
Come out my humble go berzerk and make you swallow your smirk
I splurge most and bash, capacitate mass
I fascinate as I assassinate and show task
Characters and egos, get crushed in trust
And my words stampede like herds in a dusk
Cream of all crops, topics I drop with Trotter
When heated up, I gets hotter cause I'm proper
You never knew the levitude the clever few
Different tax for revenue man if you ever knew
The tac-tic, strategies, of word, ca-pa-bil-ities
Display, de-cease
The rhythm, and man how it swerved and curved
Made a niggas dream but his hope deferred then stirred
Dig the mentals, Papermate, Bic's and Number 2 pencils
My credentials blow on instrumentals
I write an anthem throw a tantrum and remain handsome
Mysterious vibes, like I was the phantom
Erupt abruptly, then conduct amaze
You're fucked when the lyrics get bucked because I graze
Never animosity, on my property
Niggas acropoly, or they feel extreme monstrosity
Wreakin leak out the verbals ? don't forget it
The chief of edit then Malik'll shred it yeah I said it

I remain calm, lyrically I got the bomb, when you put me on, I remain calm

That nigga Thought flows like a river, I deliver styles like Domino's
Eyes closed I inhale, equality follow me now son
Listen, my divisions advance, I surpass one half of the rap mass
The other half want my autograph
Because I got soul, plus a ghetto stroll, similar to Shaft
It's the mic rapers, splittin Phillies in the cellar
My acapella verse, can stomp, I delete comp
My rated X, larynx, wrecks your context
I'm complex, confusin, lyrically amusin, I drink brews
Then when I'm groovin I'm no longer human
I'd like to take this time, to give a shout to all the money makers
In the house galore, they help me turn it out
I whip the cap to the max, I'm laid back, like your gramps
I make, niggas embarrased like they spendin food stamps
I take, my time when I rhyme lovely, me nah like
Ugly like, God we get odd to the rhythms
Rappers thinkin of steppin up, what the fuck you're doin?
I amplify the hymn, to bring your empire to ruin
Who's your girl screwin fellas? Jealous because I'm fly
Keep my sneakers dry, when you cry-baby
See, I can have you headin for the border, like a ReFugee from Haiti
Aiyyo, this brother drivin my cab, tried to flip, saying
"Pay me in advance" -- I asked him if he ever danced
In the dark, with the rap devil, Black Thought
See niggas who get caught off guard remain scarred
Into air, with headphones remainin on the domes, they hair
I resound and astound and scare, I reign terror
Into another nigga rap era, my rhymes sedate
I lubricate, like aloe vera
I'm extreme, restin in the land of the plot and the scheme
Peace to ? Rock and the Equal Team

I remain calm, lyrically I got the bomb, when you put me on, I remain calm

I drew a 2 of hearts from a deck of cards
A stock trick from my empty repertoire
Another hopeless story never read at all
I'm better off looking for the end
Where the credits are
It's a pain living life against the grain
I'm looking back and y'all look the same
Troy, Mark, and little what's his name
Memory is rerunning it all
It's the flight of my fall and it's right on the wall

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you?

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

I used to ride the train to the same two stops
And look at the graffiti on the rooftops
Like the same song playing on the jukebox
Joint called 'Faded Polaroids In A Shoebox'
Regardless to what the cadence is
It can't be forgotten like old acquaintances
I realize how depressing of a place it is
And when I notice my reflection whose face it is

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

I remember
Can you remember?
How it was
I do
Remember, do you? 

It's only human to express the way you really feel
But that same humanity is my Achilles' heel
A leopard can't change his spots and never will
So I'm forever ill
Now I can never chill
What's keeping me from breaking out like Benadryl
When my baptism of fire resulted in a kill
Sometimes it's as cut and dry as a business deal
You gotta cause the blood of a close friend to spill
But you remember still

 I will not apologize
 I will not apologize
This is for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it for that I won't
 I will not apologize
 I will not apologize
This is for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it for that I won't apologize

I'm so sick cause I'm infected but but I don't need a medic
Need a liquid anesthetic, let me show you how I get it
I don't got it but I bet it, I don't worry, I don't sweat it
You can bitch, you can dead it, you can take it there like FedEx
Nothing sweet diabetic, big dog can't pet it
Pack an L then I wet it then I fill it till it's pregnant
 face it everybody got a favorite
I embrace it like I date it but my grandma think I chase it
 I told her that her baby moving slower
Cause the world is on his shoulders then I woke up out that coma
 at it with a little black 'matic
Lay you down craft-matic, then I'm gone, black magic
 you don't want to gamble with the devil
Especially when them chewy bluies got me on another level
Cause my teacher think I'm slow but my momma think I'm special
But even she know I'm coming back like an echo.

For the statements I'm about to make I will not apologize
Niggas talk a lot of shit, really need to stop the lies
Jewels rented, cars rented, homie that ain't authentic
Acting tough on TV but to me you seem a little timid
Don't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business
Acting like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets
Shit I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits
White kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping
Or sipping on old English brew or whatever they think we do
Spraying double Uzi's cause you know they think we live in zoos
The problem is with this everyone seems to be real confused
The niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
And watch BET and the crazy shit they see
They associate with you do the same shit to me
When you look at me you see just a nigga from the projects
But can't understand this nigga's mind set but still

Yo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't going be televised
Governments is hellified, taking cake and selling pies
I ain't got a crust or crumb, to get some I'd be well obliged
Murder is co-modified, felon for the second time
Never was I into chasing trouble I was followed by
Facing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride
Vilified, victimized, penalized, criticized
Ran into some people that's surprised I was still alive
Look into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide
Got to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?
Messed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified
Had to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod
Now I'm in the black Impala looking for the dollar sign
Palms get the itching man I got to get the calamine
Before I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5
I will not be conquered by, I will not apologize

Oh, why you look so sad?
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
'cause I've seen the dark side too
When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

So if you're mad, get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide?
I get angry too
Well I'm a lot like you
When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
'cause even if you're wrong

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you

And when,
When the night falls on you, baby
You're feeling all alone
You won't be on your own

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you

I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

Uhh.. the molecular mass
of that rhythmic ass grass
is organic hip-hop jazz
that you are all about to witness
Groovy units check it owwwwt..

The nappy cat, Black Thought, digs the NasteeFatJazz
Artifacts and cardiac cerebral action
Retro is my Roots for my peoples with the plats and
braids are twist clean, cuts or fros beneath the hats and
do the dance, does I boogie backs to relax -- I does
Concentrate, it's not be natural as the grass
Hail the exit-in and let's begin yo take a dip and soul
I spill the normal knot yo kid I got that for your ass
Slips and I drips like butta
Melodic mad noise if you dig it peace to ya
If not, catch a lift to the level of my mental for a smidgen
of my spirit just a little dab'll do ya
Your butts to the cuts dig the buds of my killa
Rememberin the hot, dolla parties of the cellar
I'm deep, ghetto child of some chocolate, complected
groovy head to toe, plus crazy cooler than vanilla
I catch a slap five from my man, that's my mellow
Unique style I speak be the goods that I petal
I'm stoned blam, to the known, known around the city
of Philly that's my home, for makin wack rappers settle
It bein that I'm blem, kid I kicks, in the mix
Rhythm be the quick, fix from the sticks of my Brother
A lot of kids, diss these days I'm not amazed
cause I pays no, mind and lift the roof off the, mutha

Just because I'm out deah
I say peace to all my peoples who be out deah
To hip cats and nappy sweets you're crazy out deah
Just like my Foreign Objects because you're out deah
Just like that sister ? you know you're out deah
Just like the man, Manifest, you know you're out deah
Just like my cousin Shawn G, you're crazy out deah
To Butterfly like dat, you know you're out deah
to get up out!

Brainiac, Black's the mind, color funk, fuse the gut
I catch the what's when I kick it
Mysterious the maker of the raps crazy naps so I lacks
the cut, and got a fro but can't pick it

C-Not's my nigga knows the news of the nappy cats
Crowns and kicks, and how it ease the mind
Yo freak freak ya don't ya don't stop
Cause The Roots got the body rock shit
with the twist for your spine, bring it back, UHH!
Fat is my flow that's fluidic
The critics ain't with it, then their domes is beneath
We be the Funk, Four mind as one umm, Crumbs umm
he told us peace, it was against his beliefs
We couldn't live with him cool, with that out we gon' sprout
the record of The Roots to show my attitude is out
I'm on some crazy linear shit, takin a hit during my set
to let, these niggaz know what I'm about
I'm all about the funk, that's relaxed for your state of mind
Snaps is cool, if layin back is the ever
The unity of Bootsee's grin, growin, cause the juice began
as just deuce, groovy flaves that taste, blam together
I likes that, so doin Bobby Mick, ain't ridic', to this
In fact, that's the pen, hey yo direct

And yo my group is called The Roots because we're out deah
to get up out

Uhh, abstract organic artistry
Thought is he, that I be
Gravity does not hold me down
As I rise from the ground into sound
Melting browns drip like wax
Building blocks, nappy cat
Blazes acts, filling facts
Mental sax, sweet mental sax
Sweet mental horn, taking the physical form
of a storm of abnorm-ality, re-ality's
lo-cality, vo-cality, low calorie NOT
I got the fat shit y'all
I got the fat shit y'all
I got the fat shit y'all
I got the fat, shit, y'all..

Yeah, I'm from the illest part of the Western Hemisphere
So if you into sight seein' don't visit there
It's somewhere between Jersey and Delaware
Philly never scared and them niggas ain't timid there
Them young triggers lose lives by the minute there
It might start but the fight never finish there
They all fucked up tryin' to get the gingerbread
A few stacks be the price for a nigga's head
Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians
Clips and revolvers and George's and Benjamin's
A celebration of the loss of your innocence
To you old self you've lost any resemblance
They say the city make a dark impression
The youth just lost and they want direction
But they don't get the police, they get the protection
And walk around with heat like Charlton Heston, man

It's in the music, turn it up let it knock
Let it bang on the block till the neighbors call the cops
The cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit
They don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid
It's in the music, turn it up let it knock
Let it bang on the block till the neighbors call the cops
The cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit
They don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid
It's all in the music

It's kinda ill how we grip these bitches in the Bonneville
It's kind of a thrill, my mind it will spill, my nine it will kill
Of course bro like crossbow, I bring the force though
Hittin' your guts splittin' your torso
It's colder than the North Pole livin' unlawful
I'm giving you a jawful Of somethin' awful
Yo my theoretic is leaded, Will come and set it
The shit bang and leave you diabetic for paramedics
I spit flames and get dames to get change
With pit bull bark and lock the shock
Don't bother me Och, don't you dare lie to me Och
I don't know, who's this nigga that you try to be Och
Benefit of doubt had me think you in it for clout
Big shit, send it for route and finish him out
Joints stiff from rigor mortise
While we swimmin' in waters, women with daughters
Will have us niggas sinnin' with orders

It's in the music, turn it up let it knock
Let it bang on the block till the neighbors call the cops
The cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit
They don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid
It's in the music, turn it up let it knock
Let it bang on the block till the neighbors call the cops
The cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit
They don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid
It's all in the music

I'm gonna start it like this
Yeah
Yo check it

There's something goin' on
There's something goin' on
We live in this world where there's something goin' on
Goin' on going' on

Dig it, this world is filled with homicides and rape
All the crimes of hate just ain't the size and shape
You can walk down the block and get slumped or knocked
It don't stop y'all and it just don't stop
Dig it, this world is filled with homicides and rape
All the crimes of hate just ain't the size and shape
You can walk down the block and get slumped or knocked
It don't stop y'all and it just don't stop

I leave the microphone intrigued with my practice
This rebel stick your system like a cactus a boys sadness
Who knows what is concealed under the mattress
Ruegurs, losses and grindals when my minds in blackness
Then I act this way the beast unleashed
Rabbis, monks and priests always pray for peace
But it's deceased now only lives the true realance
Open up the mental deaths you rented through my palace
My thoughts contain the plus sign plus the malice
Not equating to your Wonderland so fuck Alice
My style is hostile on the external
But got plenty of love and warmth that's internal
The sin coronal
Surfaces from whispers from the lower
My noun like arks and 950 years of Noah
You're arch rival
You burn a cross I burn the bible
Because I'm liable, to do this
When my actions true this
But I'd rather choose to use my diction
Resurrect that blond blue eyed and put him through another crucifixion
Stay up in your jurisdiction 
My depiction is the drama
Though these eyes I've seen the trauma
Homicides in the source that was phenomenal
When I find out who banged Muwan in his abdominal
Met with Jesus to learn to Burns not commical
At times this thing ain't logical
I gots to walk around with my brain on cock
Cause it can't  won't  don't  stop

Dig it, this world is filled with homicides and rape
All the crimes of hate just ain't the size and shape
You can walk down the block and get slumped or knocked
It don't stop y'all and it just don't stop
Dig it, this world is filled with homicides and rape
All the crimes of hate just ain't the size and shape
You can walk down the block and get slumped or knocked
It don't stop y'all and it just don't stop

My mentals in flame your brains will drain
When I let the ink drip and then pass out a pink slip
I think quick so check my methodology
My stylagy is more ranty than anthropology
Between your raw legs like it's gynecology
You and your sorry ass style needs an apology
Cause an earthquake and make you shake you need neurology
These niggas kill me actin' like stars fuck they astrology
Imagin' with my badge I snatch the pagent
Turn your city to a smashing and grab it
Now it's time to burn the maggots my message stronger than Elisha
That backslap the ass like your father
Why bother?
Would any care for, lyrics I sling from my mic with cease your laughter
Mind of a bachelor to a master
What I thought that leaves you flabbergasted
Ask you what's the matter bastard?
These types of rhythms man you'd rather blast it
You hear the beats in jeeps over the weekend
Silence is golden and niggas get killed just for speakin'
The only deacon is death when ya left wounded
Layin' on the ground and meet your doom quick
I done been through the deserts of hell with Satin sittin' waitin'
Contemplatin' and trying to get me for the takin'
That's why I walk around with my brain on cock
Cause it can't  won't  don't  stop

Dig it, this world is filled with homicides and rape
All the crimes of hate just ain't the size and shape
You can walk down the block and get slumped or knocked
It don't stop y'all and it just don't stop

At times I feel as if could pull a kamikaze
Illuminatti probably in the civic center lobby
They seeds in the world student body probably
Creatin' missles they got my child holdin' pistols
Knowledge and understand will make a man murder
Stand further fuck all the swine plus they hamburger
No hallucination the lieutenant plus Illitant arean murder that's mental
Credentials is I am a hell residental with fire for the presidental
Officially it's havoc in the temple
I terrorize the heavens bring on the renaissance
With the seventh the civili the reverence reprimand
The deacon keepin' 'em from speakin'
Tell 'em seeks the false preacher and I step like a shadow on your way to
Hot concrete
And observe my peoples in the essence every weekend
We wonder what the fuck is school teachin'
Intoxicating soldiers at chaotic times reachin'
The dynasty is slim
But they only resemble what's when we attack
That split your back then we extort your specimen
I put this in your system like lesser than
Then maneuver mentally for men internal medicine
I hold the fort down with Malik symoblic
To the mind of word that's Islamic
The killer force as I deposit dealin' with logic
I keep my brain on cock it don't stop

Dig it, this world is filled with homicides and rape
All the crimes of hate just ain't the size and shape
You can walk down the block and get slumped or knocked
It don't stop y'all and it just don't stop

I wanna be able to reach an MC
And reach a little child in the same degree
And my elders excel
I mean what the hell
We might as well bridge these gaps
In all before we fall in the fire

It's a million MCs upon a plan they call real tryin' to set it
Profess mic techniques illegit
Inaccurate perceptions of reality embedded
In they minds thus they rhymes are discredit 

I use my music implemented with jewels and sport tools
To inspire all these too cool fools who say screw school
Cause they don't see the conspiracy
That's put here to trap you and me

Y'all know the battle lieutenant be on some whole 'nother other finesse genetic
They say I get it from my mother so its' inheredit-
Tary and very necessary to shine
Legendarily, heavily refined

Contemporaries like the Roots is so rad it's like dag
Which bag did they come out of, and how can I get in it to win it?
Like a raffle ticket pickin'
If you feelin' something, guess who get the sticking

I got this Ital style up close and personal
The first I find to violate, I shall retal-
Iate with realism for they whole local
To relate, we on point like decimal Abstract now

MCin' while I'm breathin' MCin' is believing
That you can host a ceremony and the dose is never phony
In fact, it's quite therapeutic
Like a B12 hypodermic needle so shoot it

Lyrically elicit upsteps the explicit
Most wicked seven digit mic wizard
My tongue lash out and strike with it
Just slightly might miss it
When I blast through your section or district

In my formative years by my peers I was influenced
Until the instruments of time killed the congruence
I peeped the blue prints on how to make true sense
Of MC's which are a nuisance I know just what to do since I'm on another lev
Brothers is fakin' jacks and think they ready for the rev
But they got a lot to learn, to make their thoughts long term
Cause on their short-cuts they made a wrong turn
Probably, timelessly I construct the fearsome
To rip your eardrum for many years to come
Professional style thinkin' rational to move wise
So hard it's a wonder y'all alive

And still breathin', niggas is dead and not even
Perpetuatin' real life the shit kicked is real trife ayo they fake bleedin'
It's obvious that they needin' attention feedin'
They cold actin' like heathens
When mics is picked up MC's scenes is kicked up
Like women with the gripper drinking Moet 'till they hiccup
Fellas hustlin' picking bricks up
Fantasizin' about the illest stick up
But rip up the jam and we be truly impressed
On stage you won't need your tef. vest
Only a mic with and a mic test
And at your best you get blessed by the fans who profess
That they can relate
With the trials you tribulate
Or the pains you endure
Cause some cats is pure
Tell horors that are true but see cats like you
Y'all fake joints just tyo get a woo-woo
The tear jerker
You be that miracle worker
Whose miracle just ran out
I think it's time you pan out
Or just plain fade, cause yo you played
We 'bout to drop on you like the Everglades

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine

I'm in the double G, three-piece tux
Screaming dressed to kill
Hope somebody call my bluff
It's a full house, sipping on a royal flush
Two queens is on my cuffs
Good times is in the cards
Living on borrowed time
I'm paying the extra charge
To feel like something small is worth a hundred large
Swag is on retard, charm is on massage
Wit is on guard, I challenge you to a duel
Who needs a chain when every thought's a jewel
God bless the weirdo when everyone's a fool
Fuck a genie and three wishes
I just want a bottle, a place to write my novel
I am heroin to those that hear a rhyme and think
How do you find this upper echelon this time
Let's toast to better days, a beautiful mind, and a flow that never age

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine

Yo, I'm never sleeping like I'm on methamphetamines
Move like my enemy ten steps ahead of me
Say my reputation precedes me like a pedigree
Gentlemanly gangsta steez beyond the seventies
Holdin' fast money without running out of patience
Move in silence without running up in places
Cake by the layers
Rich but never famous
Hustle anonymous still remain nameless
In hindsight gold come in bars like a Klondike
The minute before the storm hit is what I'm calm like
Suited and booted for a shooting like it's prom night
It's suicide right pursuers tried like
To no avail and a heroes what they died like
I've got em waiting on the news like I'm Cronkite
Not in the lime light or needed for the crime right
No boasts, just bodied, and chalked close to the line tight

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine

Yeah, outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
And inside they dressed up like it's a telethon
Black tie affair but they holding heavy arms
Straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
More Bacardi and the bouncers of the party hum
Riots erupting around and still we party on
Made the quantum leap to a king from a pawn
But it was destined the conclusion was foregone
Serenade of the former slave promenade
Cause them long days in the sun
Have now become shade
So we doing high speeds in a narrow lane
Say cheese
Free falling from the aeroplane
Another feather in the cap for all the years
That we spent in luxuries lap
Without looking back
Cause memories could sting like hornet
Damn it felt good to see people up on it

Come get your kool on, stars are made to shine

Stars are made to shine

It's a lazy afternoon

Consider this a message to my mellow in the front seat
Of the Jeep pumpin' beats for your rump
In the summertime I'm risin' to the shine at 12:20
Ghetto streets are sunny, niggas is gettin' money
It's mad hot, and what I got to do I'm not sure of
I call up Maura, this dip I know from Bora Bora
Was rappin' for a second about what I reckoned that I
Was doin' at six, she was invitin' me to the flicks
That I'm with, blew a kiss click Now I'm in the shower
I meant the bath in which I simmer for half an hour
Then got drier, put on attire to inspire
Hit my dresser for numbers of women that I admire
Laid around and lounged 'til around two
Then I got up and ate, drank a brew and caught a page from the crew
Sayin' "Where ya at? Later, meet us up at the Plat
Bring a sack, ayo it's Saturday, it's gonna be fat"
Now it's 3:37 and I still ain't left the rest
Electric Relaxation from A Tribe Called Quest
With the boom, tokin', smokin', coolin' out
As I parlay in my room cause it's a lazy afternoon

It's a lazy afternoon

From The Never Never Tunnels via satellite
Ceremonies be commencing in the candlelight
Yo is I is up in the res-in-iduals tonight
Absolutely because I\'m the kid that\'s on the mic
And I believe it\'s destiny that I got put
in a position to throw lyrics like a shotput
Yo no matter the circumstance
Thought can always make you dance
like you got the heebie-jeebies or a hotfoot
The bass is low on the meter, less than zero
So while I\'m sinning you be spinning like a planet
Yo if you dig the shit I\'m sayin you\'ll be deeper
Wish for little and your wishes shall be granted
We plant the seeds y\'all, to grow The Roots y\'all
And mad knowledge I got, from the archives
But now I got a crazy fat question:
what ever happened to Leonard Parts One to Five?

Chorus: Black Thought 

Why\'d you ask me that question? 
Where did Leonard Parts One to Five go?
Why\'d you ask me that question? 
Word/Uhh/Yeah/...
Where did Leonard Parts One to Five go..

Chariot, Chariot, come swing low--be
Cause it\'s on a lower level that I swing low, umm
?uestion, keeps me up, on the swing flow, he
don\'t got a whole name, I call him, BRO The
Roots is comin through on your audio
For you to cut The Roots down I don\'t think so
Because the sound from the ground is like be--low
And when the liquid kicks in then The Roots grow
Now my ace boom coon plus amigo
Was Shadrach Meshach and N\'bendago
There was a Alpha to Omega, motion, system
but I just call them A to O
And in all states, The Roots\'ll rock a fat show

Because I drop art like I was Pa-blo
And Pa-blo\'s last name was Picasso
But as for cash flow, I don\'t got no
dividends and, ends to spend on blow, yo
Where did Leonard Parts to Five go?

Chorus

Where\'s the third verse? Here it comes, here it goes
The second had Oodles and Oodles of..
speaking of O\'s, I\'m hard to sink like a Cheerio
And I speak up loud, so you can hear me yo
Is it A Tribe Called Quest? Is it the J.Beez?
We\'re Cool Like Dat, but yo we\'re not the D.P.\'s
It\'s the group The Roots, with the organic rap style
Plus the groove from the rhythmic rhyme file
Umm.. I\'m a big fan of the Soul
But I\'m trying to get this Roots shit in control
So I hate when people say,
\"Umm - you remind me of De La Soul,\"
cause I got a soul, of my own, and umm
Yo The Roots are taking big steps and
you can listen as we progress in
Sometimes I might come to teach a lesson
Other times it\'s with a crazy question like..

Yo.. whatever happened to Leonard Parts One to Five?
Word up; I don\'t know, anyway, Roots up y\'know
Uhh, as we do it like this
Roots up, Roots up
Roots up, Roots up
Roots up, Roots up
Roots up, Roots up
Roots up.. up, Roots up-up
Roots up, Roots up-up
Roots up, Roots up-up
Roots up, Roots _Up From the Ground_
Roots up, Roots up with the sound
Roots up, Roots _Up From the Ground_
Roots up, Roots gettin on down
Roots up, dig it
Roots up y\'all, Roots up y\'all
Roots is up Roots is up Roots is up y\'all
Roots is up y\'all, Roots is up y\'all
Roots is up Roots is up Roots is up y\'all
Roots is up..

Lyrically versatile
My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grased in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbred for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin' through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin' over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jasz shit I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin' up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin' Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetratin is void

Ya leave niggas missin' in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
 I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice
Nigga de Raw, never take a bad fall
Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin' handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin' on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin' a train honey dip and I'ma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin'
If you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?
Cause he know the time like I know the time
When I grab the microphone
It's like, summertime, laid back, to recline
In my La-Z-Boy chair
Dice Raw, the Wild Noid
I'm the fuck up outta here

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they may see
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be. Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be.

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

If you can't swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
Passing out life jackets bout to go didown
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss I'ma hit you wit dis

If you can't swizzim then ya bound to drizzown
Passing out life jackets bout to go didown
Get down with the captain or go down with the ship
Before the dark abyss I'ma hit you wit dis

And no one's in the lighthouse
You're face down in the ocean
And no one's in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It's no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there's no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

Smoking cheap weed sipping on cheap vodka
You pick your poison down Davey Jones' locker
It's rum we be wanting
By the tons my consumption
Take a look at my lungs and my liver
It's disgusting
Take a look at the man in the mirror
We start fussing
Only one person gets hurt when throwing the punches
Me
And the man behind the glass just laughs
The waves come over my head and just crash
My hand start bleeding water starts receding
A feeling comes into my heart I start believing that
I actually might survive through the evening
Survive my own thoughts of suicide that's competing
With thoughts of tryna stay alive which been weakened
By the feeling of putting on a smile while being beaten
The fear of drowning still diving in the deep end
The waters carried me so far you can't reach 'em
And it feels like there's no one

And no one's in the lighthouse
You're face down in the ocean
And no one's in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It's no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there's no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

After the love is lost
Friendship dissolves
And even blood is lost
Where did it begin
The way we did each other wrong
Troubled water neither one of us could swim across
I stopped holding my breath
Now I am better off
There without a trace
And you in my head
All the halted motion of a rebel without a pause
What it do is done till you dead and gone
The grim reaper telling me to swim deeper
Where the people go to lo and behold the soul keeper
I'm not even breaking out in a sweat
Or cold fever but
I'm never paying up on my debt or tolls either
I'll leave the memories here I won't need 'em
If I stop thinking and lie, now that's freedom
Your body's part of the Maritime museum
Face down in the past is where I'm bein'

And no one's in the lighthouse
You're face down in the ocean
And no one's in the lighthouse
And it seems like you just screamed
It's no one there to hear the sound
And it may feel like there's no one there
That cares if you drown
Face down in the ocean

If you can't swizzim then ya bound to drizzown

If you can't swizzim then ya bound to dridown

My grandmother suits was tailor made, 
Sundays Mahalia played
Simple familiar ways, 
Like how she kneeled and prayed
Willin', master forgive us, 
Our trust pastors had us real afraid
I never listened yet I still obeyed
I got to see how Philly played at such an early age
What my father was into sent him to his early grave
Then moms started chasin' that base, like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of forty nights and forty days
Trouble was my ball and chain, shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings 
But a star is what it all became
My journey from a dirty hallway, 
To the Hall of Fame
Music my therapeutic way to cope with all this pain
Was headed for the drain, 
Soakin' before the rainwater came
And chaos, into the order came
I started doin' what I'm 'sposed to do in life
Tryin' to move out of the dark, 
And closer to the light
They say if you get a chance to do it over do it right
Tomorrow isn't promised every time, you say goodnight

Turn up the boom-box, put on your high-tops
Come on outside, today's goin' be the day we
Start livin' in the new world

Yo, they got high-powered lenses on the cameras outside
It ain't nowhere to run it ain't hardly nowhere to hide
They hear you when you whisperin' so try to keep quiet
You don't even realize that you's a twinkle in the all, seein' eye
From the time you in the bar gettin' high
To havin' conversations on your phone through the wire
You can drive but it's definitely footage of your ride
Livin in this day and time, it's a funny kind of vibe
From the corners of the ceiling feel its eyes in back of me
I couldn't tell you why I think they constantly after me
Maybe it's cause the news put it to me so graphically
How niggas don't obey no laws, not even gravity boy
No benefit of doubt he had to be from
He from the corner where they known to get they casualty on
Another day another scene to perform, spotlight him on Friday
Come and lock him up Saturday morn, c'mon

Oh
It's been a long time
Since I been back around the way
It's been a long time
Let it spin let spin let it spin
Since I been back around your way
It's been a long time
Long time long time

Struck by the luck of the draw
Real life preservation
What I'm hustling for
My name black thought
The definition of raw
I was born in South Philly
On a cement floor
I had nothing at all
Had to knuckle and brawl
They swore I'd fall
Be another brick in the wall
Another life
Full of love
That lost
That's silly
This Philly
Y'all really ain't stoppin'
The boy with the pen
Like Willie
On top of the hall
Pure soul is what the city
Most popular for
Hear the tones
That will ease you
Smooth
As Bunny Sigler's soundtrack
Keepin' your head boppin' and all
It's something in the water
Where I come from
They used to sing it on the corner
Where I come from
Making somethin' outta nothing
Because everybody fifty cents
From a quarter
Where I come from
Yeah
The streets ain't timid
But I feel at home in it
Gotta see a couple people
I ain't got at
In a minute
Yeah
You can take a brother outta South Philly
Can't take it outta him really
I forever represent it
And it's

Live and dirvet
I don't need no mic check
Remember mommy told me
You ain't write that
It started in the bathroom taking a dump
Listening to Ultramagnetic
Ego tripping you won't
Pressure my word
I'm the urban vision
Of you chump
Stomped on a different ground
Sound second to none
Synthesizers tweet
To improvise your feet
I calculated every lyric to arrive on a beat
It's free
Come get high on me
Before a nine millimeter shell
Hit my pelle pelle
In the p
Yeah
It's somethin' in the water
Where I come from
They used to sing it on the corner
Where I come from
Making somethin' outta nothing
Because everybody
Fifty cents from a quarter
Yo
Where I come from
It's just a natural reaction
For crack to make it happen
Let the pen ink sink
Into the paper of the pad
Think back
When I was younger
Ghetto could have took me under
Young Peedi can't mess with North Philly
Never had
You don't know about me
You ain't stroll my streets
Look familiar
I feel ya
Longtime no see

Clap somethin'
But whatever you clap
Clap to the record spinnin'
While I'm takin' you back
To the top paper era
Baby big on that
Picture the pool room
Where the money getters was at
And street people
With feather in the cap
Or their bossolino pullin' paper
As if it's a small casino
I was a young boy
Sweepin' the floors
And runnin' to stores
But all those old heads
Would talk to me About the way
To clutch the eagle
On a buck and truck
And if I'm down
How to get back up
Just survival kid
And it's a struggle worldwide
I'm positive
Shit the ghetto might as well
Be the Gaza Strip
You know where all the monsters is
Street walkers
You don't see no consciousness I'm coming back to where
The core of the problem is
We on the job again
Y'all know what time it is

Southside, dream time, birds eye, hairstyle, go team, row team
It's got appeal, broad appeal, into the sublime
Well, okay, reset, high score, overlord, new day, new name
Stand up, state your name, like water into wine

The world's in my head, say let the wicked come
The world's in my head burn like fireflies

Horse race, dog face, go astray, days away
White noise, Georgia O'keefe, gaze away into the sun
Well, hot pillow, hairstyle, comb it awhile, gomer pyle
That's the way it goes, hair gel for men, pose in your underwear

The world's in my head, say let the wicked come
The world's in my head, burn like fireflies

'Cause oh, you never know who will come and who will stay
'Cause oh, you never know who will come and who will stay
Well, stay, live a long time today
Live a long time, live a long time with me

The world's in my head, let the wicked come

The world's in my head, burn like fireflies

The world's in my head, say let the wicked come

Ooh, let the wicked come

The world's in my head, burn like fireflies

'Cause oh, you never know, who will come and who will stay
'Cause oh, you never know, who will come and who will stay
Well, stay, live a long time today

All we need, all we need, all need
Spread the love around.
Yeah.

Sometimes when I am sitting by myself, 
Those quiet moments when not with no one else, 
I'm mesmerized by all the many good things in my life. 
I think about the time when I was younger,
And the older that I get, the more that I feel wiser.
With the love of friends and family,
Get stronger, and it carries me on through.

So, I say lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely 
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely,
Lovely, lovely, love my family. 
So, I say lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely,
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely,
Lovely, lovely, love my family. 

Sometimes when I am waiting for the bus, 
The sun shines bright, and I feel peace like nowhere else. 
I know I'm big and healthy, life keeps going, I keep moving, I'm alright. 
I go to school and educate my mind, and the way the world is spinning 
Makes me want to turn around and start all over, hit the reset, and go back in time

Oh, baby, love me.
Oh, spread the love around.
Yeah.

So, I say lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely 
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely,
Lovely, lovely, love my family. 
So, I say lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely,
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely,
Lovely, lovely, love my family.

I did it all for the money, Lord
It's what it seems..
Well, in the world of night terrors it's
Hard to dream, they hollerin' cash rules everything
Just call it cream, cause when it rises to the top
You get the finer things
Oceanfronts, rolling blunts with model chicks
And saying grace over lobster and steak
Like please forgive us for riding Benzes with camera plates
Too busy looking backwards for jackers to pump my brakes
For help signs to symbolize the lives that hunger takes
Addicted to the green, if I don't ball I'll get the shakes
I'd give it all for peace of mind, for Heaven's sake
My heart's so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket breaks
Cause everything that wasn't for me I had to chase
I had to take, I had to take

They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means
They told me at the end
Don't justify the dreams
That I've had since a child
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my 
Make my 
Departure from the world

Tryin' to control the fits of panic
Unwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic
Whatever, see it's really just a matter of semantics
When everybody's fresh out of collateral to damage
And my splaying got me praying like a mantis
I begin to vanish
Feel the pull of the blank canvas
I'm contemplating that special dedication
To whoever it concern, my letter of resignation
Fading back to black, my dark coronation
The heat of the day, the long robe of muerte
That soul is in the atmosphere like airplay
If there's a Heaven I can't find a stairway

They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means
They told me at the end
Don't justify the dreams
That I've had since a child
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my 
Make my 
Departure from the world

One two
Yes, The Roots layin' back, real-xin
Coolin' out with my man Malik be
We call him Sla-xon
YaknowhatI'msayin? We in effect

We about to flip it on some ol' laid back, mellow my man tip
We gon' set it like this
Yo check it

Bust it, La Di Da Di, who likes to party
Like Slick Rick the Ruler I'm cooler than a ice brick
Got soul like those afro picks, with the black fist
And leave a crowd drippin' like John the Baptist, it's
The cause of that "Oh shit!"
The skits I kick, flows like catfish
And got many emcees on the blacklist
I'm sharp as a cactus plus, quick to bust gymnastic tactics
Us, Roots is really true to that rap shit
Now holla to the scholarly, street skats that follow me
Back to the Soul Shack with packs of rap colonies
Max that, Foreign Objects is mad abstract, make Shadrach
Offender want to go like Meshach, Black
Thought the nappy cat a bookworm shoe styles like sperm
Cool as Malcolm Little with conch a la perm burn
The herb sticks like wicks, and flips when I slaps the hand
Of my mellow my man, Malik be

Here I goes, negroes best to know the flower
The professional, best in those skills that kills so uhh
Whoa, slow down before you go down 
Trixie this is Agatha Christie your slain and know now
Next contender, Malik's the axe offender
Critique me so uniquely with mystique that's so deep within the
Microphones I grip, psych with poems so's I slits throats
Put him in a quote, when he croaks
They sayin', isn't it, is it the negro that did it?
'Cause wreck with the tech, make you jump and say 'ribbit'
I exhibit many forms, prohibit the corny forms
 on the norms
Capture, was to, whack ya
Manu-facture, you can even ask Anita about the, rapture
I figured, perhaps ya, a say it slam

Yo, I got spunk, plus funk
And Jump Like Punks, to Get Beat Down
Turn that heat down, I'm crazy cool
Deeper than the pool than Wilt the Stilt
Damn near drowned in clowns bounce to sound
When Thoughts pound
And brown's, my complexion section Southern
My brother-in is Jex, I
Sweats no sex, cause this kid gets
Grits n shit, it's flex to drains that was crazed
When your heart spit up, dip dup damn
Yo I lost it but
Back is the Black Boogey Man
Manic mad musician, maker of noise
That's jocked, by your homeboys
I rocks my flocks of sheep, it's the slickest shepherd around
I was lost but was found, now I gets down
From Philly to the Apple I, stop and holla tunes and then hit
Up-town, Diggin Planets when they get Earthbound
I kick the groovy tunes for you and yours, when I pass the can
To my mellow my man, Malik be

Whoa, shucks, my nuc snuff ducks 
Abruptly I erupt, to destruct, deducts
In wax I like to smack em, stroke em as I cap em
Change my name to Saran or Reynolds then I Wrap em
Negroes know we be furrow to my borough
Cause my ass is so thorough, like Levert Gerald
Too strong to be sterile
So I impregnates the greats 
Bust the Pacino's, I won't trust them
Even though I lust them shapes -- females for retail prices
Twice this nice, this witch sure does her spices
I won't smirk, cause my name's not Urkel
The voice with the multiple choice, she does a circle
You want to turn and page your eyes, and try to plagiarize
But I degrade ya, slaughtered ya and slayed ya
Microphones I grip equipped to flip the hyp-ocrites
And nit-wits, with tidbit skits, them ain't
That was a curse, but I divide it in half
Gets the airplay, no fair play, you're feelin the wrath
Of Malik, aiyyo get tragic, negroes that get dramatic
Because I have the habit to smoke rabbits like a addict
So if you can not rap I will just slap YOU
If you wants to pick up on your nose be shows the chrome
And then we cap, YOU
It's too bad, dem cyan't understand de true check

I had no disguises, no verdicts, no alibis

Look into my window, tell me what you see
M-ill-i-tant school of philosophy
When niggas get dealt wit mental velocity
Connect my sentences and thoughts like apostrophes
You represent hypocrisy, it ain't no stopping me
Until I fulfill the term of my prophecy
My attitude is scarred by this inner-city urban
Iller dolo stress on my brain just like a turban
Who get grazed by the bullet?
Triggers, who's quick to pull it?
The anti-bullshitter, Islamic extortioner
You're the forfeiter unfortunately
Niggas who wanna gyp me
I cause humidity so come and get me
I'm simply, the cat to lay back
I chill and what you
The silent ninja
Intends to injure, now I got you
Sanity was lost so now I'm found insane
I'm seeking streets to jeeps
Hours, days, to weeks
I even speak to geeks
I hold my fortune, it's sweet
I'm discreet in the streets, but that's just the way I play though

Lieutenant university of philosophy
While you not possibly escaping what I'm meditating
My shackle of thought tackle you while I'm educating
Your dome's resonating from inhalation of darkness
While I spark the smart shit from what you waiting
Since you waiting me at the top of the pile
Wild delaware file, pennsylvanian, sub-terranean style
Step up into my crevice and taste the medicine of the champagne
King like evelyn leaving you leveled and
Sabatoged, it's all camouflage like the devil and guns
And coke peddling, Olympic medaling flashback
That of a war veteran, blast at
The programmer bringing lashes 'cross your back
On some accuracy of a brainwashed Bosnian troop
That swooped down through your roof without sound
On a lyrical Nat Turner mission, reacting off of intuition
Continuously alert, no intermission
If your ears hurt, you shouldn't listen
That means you artificial and my style'll poison your brain tissue
Your inanes are crippled once the gamma rays hit you
My grains habitual and I should never go against
The ritual I've been mastering ever since
I was among the flavor youth, remain sharper than a saber tooth
My deliverance is self-evidance
Vi-tal, lyri-cal science

Shit's imported, exported

The illest medely got you in the choke hold
Illadel epilouge, top league plus plush in Vogue
Slice tongues from your area code
Student of life with the rugged exterior mode
Blind a devil with the bold black and gold shine
I walk the thin line and hold mine, let the people respond
It's mind detect mind
Swine decline let the power refine
Build like it's 1999
In this day and time
The reptillion rooms, the sextillion tons
Your armageddon gwan come from the sun
Untouchable cuts that's unclutchable for some to understand
So y'all sit back and wonder damn
I like to take this time to show you who I am

Search the premises, I leave no clues for detectives
My verbal impact across your back slap
You talk about you see me, but your vision's full of cataract
It don't matter that, your glass house I shatter that
Bad luck I walk under now show me where the ladder at
Pull up the urinal organs up in your bladder cat
Approachin' you with shriller rhetoric, as if you had a sac
Now crews down for it, your gas pedal floor it
With ammo and artillery and stash spots to keep and store it
I used the banner of a slant with a zort
Change your strategic plan, my man's getting bored
Your vocal chord is fraudulent, and not the true porcelain
I bring the fire, earth, and the source of wind
The force of sin will endorse the pen
We all search for sanity, but I think that it was lost again
Now which stick of artists, can be the smartest
My beam of sunlight shines the brightest in the forest
Regardless, artists dislike because I'm ?
Control the temper, makin' MC's whimper
I tilt the Earth from off the axis in the center
Next I'm in the womb like a placenta
M-Illi-Tant the city ninja, uplift
Cause I'm the soul avenger, remember I'm no great pretender

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members
Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members
Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members

Strategis, I bet y'all niggaz can't believe this
I read you like a whole avenue that's filled with meters
Parked, fuck your back talk, I watch how niggaz cat-walk
Over my pit of venom and send em to the asphalt
For inquisitives, who want to try to test me
What protects me, will make you shake like epilepsy
Plague your neighborhood with lyrical le-prosy
Stimulate more than Ecstasy y'all niggaz check my recipe
Dig it, I must observe it, analyze when I'm chillin'
Peep out who's the villain then make your whole pavilion
Of a Sicilian, excuse the greed don't want a mill'
I want a zillion - stacks of Franklins to the ceiling
I counts stacks imported, fuck the yacht and the mansion
I want Pluto and Jupiter, political, universal expansion
Buy out Tommy and Halle Hanson
Kidnap America, ? you hold it for ransom
Pass it down to my grandson, I got no time to be romancin'
Only time's for mental food and advancement
This game of Life is strictly chancin', get to know
The nature before I get know the nigga while I'm glancing
Enhancing, is my mental - I play in the midst
A squad a team most crews is not in the halfs of rentals
My utensils, display a whole variety
Even when in the cut niggaz can't cut they anxiety
Peep, I fill your brain with suspicion, pay attention
Like you paid tuition, and stop all your bull-ishin
The rap chemist in the lab to the finish
The mic is my apprentice, cause I can't stand
Courts or tennis, my pigmentation is the menace
That's why the system's always tryin to pursue with a blemish
Pale asses, think a nigga in this
My flow's tremendous, for the meal you can't replenish
The question you ask me, situation get worse
Fam I won't befriend ya, cause I'm no great pretender

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members
Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members

It's like that, one time for your mind
Fifth Dynasty, intertwine and combine
M-Illi-Tant
The Bad Lieuten-ant
One hundred X, Bahamadia
Minds and souls, like that
Fifth Dynast', my man ?, P.R. Star
My man Slick Looka
Check it out, one time like that
Feel the Fifth
The One-Fifth attack
Your backbone and spine
Check it out
Brother Q.U.E.S.T.
South Philly west so plain

Everything's changing around me
And I wanna change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'm-a get my shit together
It's now or never

I'm sick, sick of waiting in vain
Tired of playing the game
Thinking of making a change
Finally breaking the chains
Every phase, every happening craze
When it's said and done
My head is right back in a haze
I'm ready for the next chapter and page
To start acting my age and part ways
With black thought from back in the days
I'm stargazing from the back of the stage
Questioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise
What's the phrase--bygones is bygones?
Niggas who used to be the underdog is icons
People say the light shines once in a lifetime
Is this mid-life kind of crisis a little bit like mine?
I'm thinking not now, but right now
I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now
I fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now
The quick and the dead--which is my look-a-like now
I'm moving ahead

Yo, opportunities lost because I blew 'em
On the sunniest days of my life I cried through 'em
Mom's was out the picture and pops I barely knew him
And I would pray to God, but I'm tired of lying to him
Tired of trying to run from the things inside of us
Got a lot of fam' and a lot of admirers
Who tell me that I should aspire to be changed
But when I think of changing, it's like why even try this shit?
My mind hazy and my thoughts they get distorted
I know my good and bad needs both get recorded
You do right so your soul can last
But my role was cast before I even auditioned for it
So I don't really see an end to my vice
It's just false reclamation, no end of my strife
Feel the evil overpowering
You can go ahead throw the towel in
'Cause, nigga, that's the end of the fight
When you can only see the tunnel at the end of the lights
Like  it's the end of your life
And I'm out

When I look into the mirror and see my own image
It feels like there's something else far off in the distance
Something I wanna see, but something that's resistant
And every day the haunting is growing more persistent
I never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it
And the constant pounding's driving me ballistic
I ran from it for years, but it's still next to me
And it's growing stronger take and leaving less of me
I can't fight it now; I know it's just destiny
And I just wonder what's gonna happen when it catches me
Will it leave me face down in 
Or will it just start bringing out the best of me?
But is the best of me really just the worst of me?
And if so yesterday could be my anniversary
In sinners' court it's important to have church with me 
I'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me
I feel that change is an absolute certainty
'Cause what's going on is a state of emergency

Everything's changing around me
And I wanna change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'm-a get my shit together
It's now or never
It's now or never

Yo, the spirit in the sky scream homicide
But it was time to ride on some niggas funny talking
If too much money talking
We make em economize
Real rap, no tale spinning, such is the life of a
Kam-I-Ka-Ze pilot
We wilin' out of control until we all make the funny papers like Comic-Con
Feared in all streets so, if you ever see me out in y'all streets
Find another one to occupy
I never hope for the best
I wish a nigga would
Turn around and walk away
I wish a nigga could
Listen to my instincts and say fuck the rest
But once you've had the best better ain't as good
Weak heartedness cannot be involved
Stick to the script, nigga, fuck your improv
Like the samurai
The street's Hammurabi Code
Play your part, shut the fuck up, and do as I was told

I was always late for the bus
Just once can I be on time
Then I start to think what's the rush
Who wants to be on time
Feeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

Not a thing I fear besides fear itself
This is clearly a lesson learned for someone else
Reach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf
Cross around my neck
I've been taught by stealth
Capture this moment in time, it's a smash and grab
And where my party people y'all finna have a blast
You say goodbye, I say hello first and last
Hello hello, Now all of y'all elevate your glass
To an example of what time will do to you
When those nameless things just keep on eluding you
When shit is new to you and lies is true to you
Words of suspects-usual, coming though to you
Man, I guess if I was ever lucky it was one time
Then I went missing looking for the sublime
A nigga stayed low, left the ladder unclimbed
Time after time, verse blank, the line un-rhymed

You ever wonder what's the big fuss
For everyone be on time
What's the big deal, why do they feel
The need to have us marching on line
Feeling unlucky and if I'd ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

I wonder when you die do you hear harps and bagpipes
If you born on the other side of the crack pipe
Niggas learn math just to understand the crack price
Then drive in head first like the jack knife
Cause out here, yo you niggas can't belly flop
If you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop
One time means being on the front line
Being on the front line means ducking one time
The pendulum swinging my way, couldn't be more blind
Niggas talk to the cops? Not even one time
Cause we all going down just like the sub prime
Or a cheap ass half gallon of Ballantine
But hopping over gates to escape is sublime
Then through the alley way and down to the sub line
Tales from the streets
A life of high crime
To make it to the bottom
Such a high climb

I was always late for the bus
Just once can I be on time
Then I start to think what's the rush
Who wants to be on time
Feeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

Hope of the world is in our generation 

It's all left up to us to change this present situation 

Take caution from our elders, don't make the same mistake 

Let's fill the world with love, and get rid of all the hate

Our elders taught us one thing but, practice another 
Just look at what happened to the Indian and the brother

Straighten it out
Straighten it out 
Straighten it out 

Hope of the world is in our generation 

It's all left up to us to change this present situation
 
Our leaders make us fight, and we don't know what for

If they want people killed, let them fight the war

It's gotta end somewhere, this killing's got to cease
If no one were to fight, we'd all live in peace

Our generation, it's all left up to us
Our generation, let's do just what we must 
Straighten it out, 
Gotta straighten it out
Straighten it out, 
We can straighten it out yeah

As long as there's a you, there's a better me 
It's why we're together and stronger 
Than they ever thought it could be
A world motherless, can health care cover this? 
A love for all people no matter what the culture is 
Our generation, is makin' huge strides 
A self-empowering movement that's on the rise 
The more the door is open, the more the youth can see 
A fair chance means a greater opportunity 
To have a brighter future, deeper insight 
Work hard to be anything you want in life 
It's what it's all about, the longevity 
Educated enough to know what's ahead of me 
Need to straighten it out, seek and you'll find 
They can cage your body, but not your mind 
We lay it all on the line in the struggle 
We grew, but together here's what we gotta do 

Our generation, it's all left up to us 

Our generation, 

Let's do just what we must 
Straighten it out, our generation
Straighten it out
Lets straighten it out, 
Straighten it out, our generation
Straighten it out yeah 
C'mon yeah our generation
Hey hey lets straighten it out, 
Lets straighten it out
Our generation, let's straighten it out
New york city
Our generation, let's straighten it out
Atalanta
Our generation, let's straighten it out
Los Angeles
Our generation, let's straighten it out

I woke up in the darkness at 12:17, to shots and sirens
Look out the window, peep the high beams
Now they searchin', the cops lookin' for the person
That pulled the trigga
Medical figures is nursin' the kid that got shot
Some innocent ak that would front
To flip the rock on them at King Street block
I tried to tell him to stop 'cause yo, it's ghetto red hot
Similar to the blood now floodin' his top
I take a step out the spot, to the point of attack
And see the shorty wop heart blast out his back
Damn, I'm thinkin' it don't cease, it's no more peace
Police level increase, but what the fuck
It's still crime on the streets
I can't breathe, now what's goin' on?
One minute you alive, the next, you're gone
Illadel-P-H-I-A Hell
Bust off into the heavens for the nigga who fell
And hit the L, for the niggaz who fell
When that could have been prevented
In front of the flat your moms rented
And no one expect that from you, 'cause you was timid
Fuckin' with them cats from outside city limits
Funny how this whole thing changed, an off minute
Yo, dig it, Panic!
None of this is ever granted
Drownin' in a nightmare, stranded

It looks like another one's comin around 
So The Square Roots gotta get down, bust it

Makin you move to the groove as we sooth
the ear of the listener on the musical

Go where you want or go and see all you wanna see
Because yo, your ambitions I won't neglect
And to the brothers who ain't here, nuff respect

And he's Black Thought, the boy you know is 
The rhythms I recycle sometimes prehistoric
The mic for the popcorn's like it's metaphoric 
So many different factors in the ?uestion's style
Arrythmic by the end, I'm givin more than one child
Abstract soloist comin from the heart
All the way from Philly, from the West part
Relax your mind and let your body be at rest
Flow in slow mo', and let the BROther manifest
Now the second verse has been pourn
On to Kid Crumb I pass the popcorn

It looks like another one comin around 
Kid Crumbs would you come and get down, c'mon

Blessed is the next at the second still before the 4th is passed
I'm gassed off the edible raps, and that's illegible
Tommy used to bug, when I come around
Screamin at the top of my lungs -- you gots to get down
Now, they heard the sound and wanna give the kid a pound
on the down low *whispering* Relax baby, keep it underground yo
From the crown of notty hair that I wear to the funk feet
Wonder why the sisters dig the brother missin five teeth
Peace I gots to rock so pass the popcorn and shit
Quick to lick a shot to umm, Wheezy, and Cricket
Used to kick it in the house until I got myself evicted
Now The Crumbs is restricted to the popcorn, elected
from The Roots, I griff the rest and share the stash of popcorn

Back to Black Thought, rock on 
And on  and on 
And on , pass the popcorn!

Honey, glazed, amazed at the art Black Thought dis-plays
I get mad props and the compliment pays
Makin me more funky and it shows on stage
Word right BROther cause I'm goin through a phase
I wanna be a pioneer so trails I blaze
Straight past the days when I used to be enslaved
But don't eat all the popcorn BROther ?uest 
Yo BROther ?uest say it
A bit for my hit makin it legitimate and give
credit to the attitude you set it don't forget well it's
gotta be live, cause that's the way I'm rockin it and
pop-corn is in my pocket then I guess it's rockin yo,
the S-Q-T'n, Black Thought of seeing
I know you're all agreeing, I'm rocking and I'm being
Ripping another chapter, just for you to clap ta
To the sounds of vexed I make you step just like a camper
I pass, the popcorn, the mix I drop on the mic

It's cool and as long, as you and the song, be mellowin out

Peaceful minds, in a land of war 
Seek peace of mind, through mental peacefulness 
Peacefulness, peacefulness, peacefulness 
Is in the mind of the beholder 

Behold, my mental piece 
Could shatter your peace, to pieces 
Pieces and portions of rhythmic distortion relax me 
The echos reverb and feedback of reality disturb my peace 

Forcing me to retreat, to the below beneath 
Down a step and a step and a step and a step 
And a step beyond 
To a level of my own 

Private, mystic, ritualistic, culturalistic sanity 
Yet some say that I am insane 
Is that not ironic? My soul not sonic 
As I flow through the tonic, of life I find 

That the strife behind, that pushes and pulls 
And pulls and pushes me 
Into all of the bullshit that I experience from day to day 
Is the reason for my search, or journey, or struggle 

To find, the broken pieces of the sign 
That combine, to form the crooked line 
That we call, peace y'all

I the beginning
It was me
I was rhythm
I was life
Two turntables
And one m

Pass the what? Pass the popcorn 

Yo, I wrote this, basement, Never Never Tunnel type portion
Just to accompany some audio distortion
Bust the popcorn, drop it ons my cassette and
Yo Crumbs, umm, how you feel? I hope it's blessed man
Dig The Square Roots be the setters of examples
Findin mad rhythm in the static of your samples
Quick to make you move to my groove as I sooth
the ear of the listener on the musical
Prisoner G, now you're free you can be all you wanna be
Go where you want or go and see all you wanna see
Because yo, your ambitions I won't neglect
And to them brothers who ain't here, nuff respect
So BROther ?uest, how ya livin, what ya givin black?
To me the brother with the linens and the applejacks;
busy til the break of dawn
The first verse is born I pass the popcorn

Pass the what? Pass the popcorn 
Say what?
Pass the what? Pass the popcorn 

Secondly, I speak for the ?uest from the S-Q-T 
And I'm Black Thought, therefore you know it's funky
The rhythms he recycles sometimes prehistoric
The mic for the popcorn's like metaphoric 
So many different factors in a ?uestion style
Cause he's the father and he's giving more than one child
The abstract soloist, drummin from the heart
All the way from Philly in the West part
Relax your mind and let your body be at rest
Flow in slow mo', and let the BROther manifest
Now the second verse has been born
I'm Black Thought and I pass the popcorn
On to Kid Crumb I pass the popcorn

Pass the what? Pass the popcorn 
Say what?
Pass the what? Pass the popcorn 

From the Southern section of Philly my affection
affiliates me with kids, from the store to pastry
The Foreign Object, direct from ? with the skit
that be rugged, it was the drumsticks and the buckets
back in the days, now the Rubber Band plays to accompany
?uestion upon the drums and displays mad soul
Soul be the source of the blam Roots fam
as we grow and expand like the afro
With menacing music seriously I'm sinister
I shout, move about, turn it out like minister
Diggin the flip-side when I slide I gets biz with
mad melanin, chocolate, like a chip that's black man
from the dark room with the mad raps homegrown
Knots and knaps upon the dome from thinkin
I'm sinkin in the sound cause I gets and got down
Lettin Black Thought's out of lockdown, buckshot
Lick it to the tick of my measure's on the Richter
Grits getter so grab your sister
I get wreck so check my respect from the wreck
that I've gotten biting this'll make your fronts turn rotten
The original, rock chewer, from a duo
whatever called po' folkers or Crumbs, and his mouth broke
Kids wanna laugh so I blast on your ass to - wait see
Chase me and see if you catch the circular knot
Style buckwild the acoustic boom
Square Root of Black Thought broadcast with the popcorn
It's like that y'all
The popcorn popcorn as I pass y'all
I go..

Pass the what? Pass the popcorn 
C'mon
Pass the what? Pass the popcorn 
C'mon

I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic

Just think, what if you could just, just blink yourself away?
Jeff X can rock the mic with tooth decay
I be the 5 foot 7, residing at the Mecca, rest address in south section
Used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass
Back in eighty-six
Easy with the chicks, I was a chocolate boy
Raised in the cellar with the rhythm like Ella
Walking mega-trife streets to the subway where I lay
Til the train stop, then a nigga hop
Used to do the pop dance to the Planet Rock
At the block party everybody jocked 
It's the MC sucka niggas envy
I got my contract in 1993 and
I shall proceed

I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic

I wake up early in the morning, I mean early afternoon
Break a lyrical hymn of the stem like boom
I'm flyer when I'm higher put my shit up on a tomb
That nigga represented on the 28th of June
I'm representing Philly on the 28th of June
I can make you feel that I'm a surreal cartoon
With my pistol in the face of hip hop, stick it for papes
Because I'm on a paper chase, yes I'm on a paper chase
My Timberlands are fully laced I be the Mr. Boogeyman
With records from 125th to Japan
I let them play like Donny Hathaway and shake a hand, shake a hand
Your lady tried to kick it, but I couldn't play my man
My niggas is my niggas ya see she didn't understand
I shake your hand and shit'll hit the fan, just think
Just think, what? What if you could, just blink, what?
Just blink yourself away?
As I proceed

I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic

Malik B get on the mic yo there's too much on my mind 
Malik get on the mic, there's too much on my mind

Johnny on the spot, got the rhythm and the rhyme
Fucking with The Roots, you know them niggas is the dime
I can make a hundred yard line start to dash
I can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
I can make Conan and the Titans clash
And I could Metallica and Guns 'N Roses crash
Used to smash crash parties like I was disturbed
Used to make plots against the herringbone herb
But now, all I do disperse the verb
And like a nerd I can make you say, "He's superb"
Worded perfect, never ever shall you misinterpret
I move styles like bowels so now you know I'm worth it
Direct from Philly, the lands where niggas scheme
So you know I got the sheen in my gleam

I shall proceed, and continue to rock the mic

Rock on, to the break of dawn 
Freak on to the early morn 
Khadafi and Sue-kwon, you got it goin' on 
To my man Big Shawn, you got it goin' on, now, yo 
You got The Roots in the house 
We also got Bahamadia in the house, representin' lovely 
With you ears now proceed 
It's flavor you wouldn't believe as we proceed 

I shall proceed and continue to rock the mic
I shall proceed and continue to rock the mic

Let's, kill all the small talk, and just elaborate 
The Roots collaborate I see myself as rather great 
How the words generate, whole crews disintegrate 
when I penetrate 
As if in the course flow with intensive force 
You best to go and check your source about my textual course 
Simplicity, it sounds complex, you might miss it 
But after you critique it you can kiss it 
I'm assisting fire force that leaves statistics 
When identify niggaz simplify you'll feel no sympathy 
My lyrics send you on a permanent excursion 
I never would decide when your lifespan was submergin' 
My style is urban not suburban when I'm splurgin' 
Gosh these MC's I wash more than detergent 
I can split the Red Sea but deadly 
Take heed, illadelph style as I proceed 

Bahamadia hits the melodies mellowly 
Brand new, funk doobie, choosy with the tactics 
when I gets Raw, like Dice, nice 
with the flavor, Do You Want More?!!!??! 
Of the Organix, pure 
Eargasmatic, from Distortion to Statics 
Automatic, systematic 
I'm nasty at it 
So hand me the five micraphones like they did Illmatic 
One time for the mind 
Rhyme be coming from an illadelph state of mind 
The real is not whole or half time 
all the time, and I shall proceed 
I'm movin on baby, I shall proceed 
To remain, on point like an infrared beam 
Succeed, in chasing out the ultraviolet dreams 
No Mas like Shorty, 'cause it's all about me 

Black and handsome, holdin' MC's for ransom 
Thoughts command some, is this, a phantom? 
Crews I mangle, y'all know my anthem ain't the Star Spangled 
I hit you from the most bizarre angle, rectangular 
visions of papes my mind conceive 
Motivatin' me to achieve as I must proceed 
when I ride the train, traumatized to maintain 
but laid back, the tracks can relax the brain 
I got to deal with everything on this intelligent plain 
Servin' as a killer 
to the pain I live a High Life like Miller 
Me and the mic's mechanized 
Respect recognize with mind beyond wise 
Limitless when I bless the mic with speak 
Dialect never weak, y'all niggaz know Tarik 
From seven-fifth Snider Ave. got the flavor you need 
For the ingredients indeed so to the lead I shall proceed 

To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark; check it out

Southeast to Pennsylvania, Transportation Authority
Is what I'm probably on, if I ain't whippin' a Land
Throughout ya section; my mind's in traum'
Nine times out of time I rhymes upon the L-Train
Within my brain, fountains over rugged mountains
Of my terrain; dig it; I came too far to front
So I'm meditatin' on how to maintain
Stepped off at City Hall into the rain
And ran into my nigga named Dane, I mean, Hakeem
And we was buildin' on how we could organize the team
For this capital gain bein' that we in the rap game
It's time to have it all; he said he figured he same
We realized this a planet of cream to obtain
When the predominant rap, conglomerate rap spark the flame
Hark the name, the fifth from the Ill-Power Hill at that
He dropped me off within the streets of South Phil'
Where niggas think that killing's living real
Shorty's is getting wetted, fulfilling their fantasies to set it
We don't sweat it, by the fifth you get beheaded
I pivot through my borough givin' pounds to the dreaded
At the lye spots I got credit; could run 'em down
In alphabetical order it's sorta pathetic
Yo, I'm livin' life within a labyrinth of nonsense
This is a consequence of being Philly residents
Tryin' to get it on, the rhythm gettin' shitted on
The exquisite I exhibit to shine, yo

To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark; check it out

I walk through this field with criminals
Ill, die-hard soldiers try to make it towards the generals
Hard-headed, rugged captains walkin' head on through action
Turnkeys on the closed caption
I bring the skills of wizardry
Treat emcees with bigotry, so now you see the picture vividly
Seduce your brain from the temple over instrumentals
The fifth chant; you see the exhaust out
The swift camp mannerism is to scan your vision
You see the light; you can't eclipse the sun
We call back the young, but still they'll strap a gun
To shoot caps that spook cats and rappers hung
Now you might tube across from the diners where you find 'em lost
Niggas hearts so cold, they sport frost
The M-the-ilitant, the Bad Lieutenant kill your camp
You're now a victim of reality, my personality
Afflicted, for three to five if convicted
Illicit, because most cats will live corrupted
It ain't no pity in this; inner-city niggas fuckin'
Exquisite, I exhibit the shine; now check it out

To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark; check it out

Inclined to rap about facts; I never fake jacks
Shit is real like E-packs, forty fifty-sixes
Trims and gimmicks couldn't faze the true heartache
When I first started, but then few remember this
Anti-gangsta bitch, sporting new jewels
Plain Jane styles internal to the naked eye
Derived from mind states of Cold Crush tapes
And beat breaks seduced by means to elevate
Equates my views with the passing
Those matching this intellect identify, for like minds
Intertwine one thought in unison
We exquisite, I exhibit the shine, ah

To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin' the mind
All my peoples that be knowin' the time, come on
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter 'fore we spark; check it out

Dancin' on the dance floor
Girl, it's you that I adore
Step off stage and scream for more
All I see, pussy galore
Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time
After that, I guarantee
You will be standing next to me

Yo, my own head once said, it's more powerful than cocaine
Freaks dancin' in a line like Soul Train
To get your pride up, that extra push
Niggaz lookin' for the time of their life, coppin' a rush
Yo I know sis', dawg, her name Lorraine
She's a thick brick house with a chocolate frame
I went to school with her
Twelfth grade, I used to fool with her
She put me on with her squad, I got cool with her
She used to say she wanted to be a doctor
And couldn't nothin' stop her
From gettin' up that cash
For tuition, even if she had to shake that ass
Fucked up, her money ain't accumulatin' that fast
Lorraine know it's real, 'cause sex controls America
Turn the TV on, it's in the open on the regular, yo
What the freaks in the video for?
Fuck a song, gimme a thong, and pussy galore

You see, life is about marketing pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Nations going to war for the pussy galore
Even the cash could afford all the pussy galore
Yo, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the screen to the record store, pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Even the cash could afford all the pussy galore

Yo, desire and lust can make a man kill
Or jump off the bridge, cuffed to a motherfuckin' anvil
So it's promoted like it is so all y'all know
Keep a nigga under the spell, you under control
But yo, I seen it make people slit they wrists
Weakness, pussy make a spy say secrets
But what for? Cause sex is the law
???, many an empire rise and fall
From the squares to the players
From the pimps to the whores
To big checks that never would have been endorsed
Ya know, I sit back and just peep thangs
Nine outta ten, it's the same songs, only the beat changed
So don't be lookin' at your peeps strange
When I conduct a little Litmus test up in your heat range
That's when you see me up on stage with six
Wicked ass chicks fittin' to get crunk with this

Life is about marketing pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Corporations going to war over the pussy galore
Even the cash could afford all the pussy galore
Yo, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the screen to the record stores, pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore

Yo, fresh cut, with the thick black velor
With the black ??? sneaks, headed out for tour
Lookin' out the limo window up at the billboards
Two hundred miles, she was the only thing I saw
Promotin' everything, from the liquor to the nicotine
Cell phones, anti-histamines, chicken wings
You gotta show a little skin to get them listening
For real yo, the world is a sex machine
Full of pretty freaks in designer jeans
That go to extremes to conjure all kinds of schemes
Half the time, it ain't even responsibly
Tryin' to take me some place I'm not tryin' to be
Ghetto, Sin City, where the P is free
You catch a bid far worser than a one to three
All up in the after-hours on the second floor
For that good thing, that keep 'em comin' back for more, ya heard me

It's about marketing the pussy galore
Every time I turn around, there's more pussy galore
Nations going to war for the pussy galore
Even the cash could afford all the pussy galore
Dig it, gang wars, more pussy galore
From the screen to the record store, pussy galore
Even the cash could afford all the pussy galore
More pussy galore, more pussy galore

Yo, dancin' on the dance floor
Girl, it's you that I adore
Step off stage and scream for more
All I see, pussy galore
Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time
After that, I guarantee
You will be standing next to me

Dancin' on the dance floor
Girl, it's you that I adore
Step off stage and scream for more
All I see, pussy galore
Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time
After that, I guarantee
You will be standing next to me

Don't stop 
Tonight 

It's time to ride, ride

Yo, piss in the staircase, blood on the pavement
I fill the quills with it let it spill on the pages
Compose another anthem for the killers and manglers
Villains and wranglers, fifth still in the chamber
Shit, I'm scientific but my reflex's gangsta
Pull out-rageous arms from the floor of the basement
Then bust 'nuff talons if my peoplez in danger
I'm Larry Davis, duckin' helicopter, hoverin' government agents
We muscle the language
What 'Riq spit will leave your shit in utter amazement
I'm hot brolic call it contagious
The shit the Roots started got these other artists going through changes
My vision is the strangest, the rhythm is anguish
Y'all niggas on the titty in your formative stages
Is something in the iris and the way I spit
That tell these other crab rappers I ain't fo' no shit
Black traumatic, so there you have it
My battin' average, abort full of graphic assault, it's all classic
Thought, put ass-backwards rappers in a small package
Experience is all that is, I'm well established
Me and the mic in holy matrimony like a marriage
The technique in your reach, if only you could have it
For me it's automatic, it's na-tu-ral, I'm mad thoro
Poet for hired pack metal
You feel me?

Don't stop 
Tonight 

It's time to ride, ride

Yo, the load heavy
We walk around a little edgy, all ready and steady
Withdrawal like Darryl Strawberry, it figures
Niggas mad from them ghetto sandwiches and swine
Cryin' hard times, disadvantegeous, man listen
The story in the ghetto the same
Seem like it's just some things that never will change
Give birth to a style and won't give it a name
Talk 'bout consciousness it's a different thang
Envision again, the honorable 'Riq, general Hannibal speak
The understandable diabolique, animal style
Out of your dreams kid, you proud that you seen this
Fifth supreme linguist, a lyrical genious
Inject you with the broke down english
The most freshest and cleanest, 'Riq Geez, guess what the fame is
Kareem's beat makin' me fiendish
Don't act shaky and squeamish, if you real make me believe it nigga

Don't stop 
Tonight 

It's time to ride, ride

Yo, the rebel Jake Rivera
You felt another date, you better
Don't copped off, create it just save your cheddar
I hit the studio with a pen and a vendetta
Sippin' an ice cold Beck, huffin' the tenth letter
Driftin', shots lickin while the plot thickens
Sands in the hourglass thinnin', the last inning
The flash and the cash and the fast women
It's nothing, a lust for the craft keep the passion and
Blaow, kissin' my tablet with firing pins
Poke holes in the plastic for oxygen
MCs jumpin' out shoes and socks again
Must have seen their face in the news it's gots to been
Thought known as the cure for cancer
Same corrupt city as Mumia the Panther
Man to man, hammer cocked, block and standoff
Bang, gunfire slang up in the dance hall
Yo, I hold the mic that could be thrown as a pipe bomb
Bring it just to sling it at your favorite icon
Thing about my music is it ain't shit like y'all
Thought, diesel like a 28-inch python
You know what I'm saying?

When I'm on the mic there won't be no delayin'

Don't stop 
Tonight 

It's time to ride, ride

And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feeling the pinch, some feeling the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
Never leave you alone
(Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone)
Never leave you alone
(Never, never leave you alone
Never, never leave you alone)

Yo, so what you searching for? From birth
Born hurting and yearning for certain somethings
Lurking and murk them, got them turning this
Bed into a coffin, burning over passions in this passion
Or more or less over what the pastor passed us
'Cause, see, the past tense it never really passes
Phases that trap us and cage us like classes
Fogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess
Task-less dilemma to match somebody's status
And I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassing me up
Passing bucks like a casual blunt
Granted, hustling habits on the stumble, the mansion while
Bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks
Bad shit going down on the daily
While bad chicks pass in a Mercedez, damn
They say he's the bastard for chasing them
Maybe it's the patterns that make me that made me crazy

Life is fiction, competition, and contradiction
Petty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection
Love is a lotto; I know I know you know what I know
Hope is so hollow--that's why winos follow the bottle
And people pressure make death a hidden treasure
A girly pleasure, lonely language inside a letter
It's now or never--move it, move it, love it, or lose it
'Fore it's recruited, then included inside the stupid
It's things of nature; paid a player and say your prayers
Naysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars
You 'bout it, 'bout it; don't allow it to pop without it
Then those who doubt it do or die the death of cowards
The world is yours and the world we can't afford
So ignore the law; start a fire; then start a war
If you're sick and tired of your access denied
Free will died long before Glydes and i-Pod

Yo, it's too much strain, phenomenal gain
I'm going through things, headaches, abdominal pain
Tryna numb it with that kettle like I'm from the Ukraine
Check the blue flame; lighter running out of butane
What's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive?
Choices I'm stuck with, now starting to fuck with
Contaminating family and close friends
Telling me to stop burning the candle at both ends
Ain't like I'm on a coke binge, hanging in dope dens
Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in
The darker the covenant-slash-train-wreck for you to rubberneck
You ain't felt the true pain yet so you be loving that
Hit me up at black dot gov like the government
Banana Republican, alien intelligence
Kill switch, real pissed, thinking of some ill shit
The stone the builder refused he need to build with
Got immunized for both flus; I'm still sick
Via satellite, radio, the realness

And the radio daze kept us in the dark
And the satellite age brings us to the light
Some feeling the pinch, some feeling the bite
They ain't ready to talk, they're ready to fight
And the radio daze
And the radio daze
And the radio daze

It's just hip-hop hangin' in my head heavy
Malik said "Riq, you know the planet ain't ready
For the half" when we comin' with the action pack
On some Dundee shit representin' the outback
Yo, we do it like this 
You witnessin' the 5th Dynasty family click 
Across the map, one time for ya 
It's time to react to respond to react to respond 

We settin it from Southside, pushin this up North
From Illadelphian reps, to fly points across the map
Bring it back to Respond/React
Then bring it back to Respond/React to this

The attractive assassin, blastin the devil trespassin
Master gettin cash in an orderly fashion
Message to the fake nigga flashin
Slow up Ock, before you get dropped and closed like a caption
Fractional kids don't know the time for action
Styles got the rhythm that of an Anglo-Saxon
Round of applause, an avalanche of clappin
{*BLOW*} that's what happen, now what's your reaction
We heavyweight traction, pro-pornographin
Specialize in science and math and, original black man
Bustin thoughts that pierce your mental
The fierce rippin your sacks and
Vocal toe to toe impeccable splittin your back son
Simple as addition and subtraction
Black Thought, the infinite relaxed one
Shorties say they love it with a passion
Bring the international charm, see a squad I harass

React, you best adapt when I sling this rap
Another chapter, before when I have to trap ya
Map your whole path out
Go get your crowd so we can clap out
I drive down streets and take back route-positionin'
When I'm in your system like glycerin
Fans listenin', from Michigan to Switzerland
Malik be blitzed again - on the station with the discipline
Solicitin', sometimes illicit or explicit with it and
From the deep end where the hills are steep
Nobody cares to speak, a land where life is cheap
The street mentality, mixed with the intellect
Personality, hell where I dwell as well
Niggas rebellious, bodies are found down in the cellars
My man caught a shot to the stomach, now who want it?
Confronted by these dusty blunted - cats who act like
They don't know that the fact is that they're bein hunted
A process of elimination
Activate your mind with the stimulation
Enter your zone with penetration
I've seen more horror than Bram Stroker
Strip your broad or play poker, then drink mocha
The sometimes socializer, the joke despiser
You woke the wiser, dealin' with the Roots vocalizer
Up in your flesh from South Philly to West
I stampede your style, I'll compile then bless

We settin it from Southside, pushin this up North
From Illadelphian reps, to fly points across the map
Bring it back to Respond/React

Hey yo, I'm just a lyricist, a chemist of the hemp
The beat pimp, the ill Philly resident
That's far from hesitant, corrupt like a President
Never benevolent but poetically prevalent
Cooler than peppermint
The Lieutenant for niggas talkin' bout represent
No doubt, it's obviously evident I get bent
Far from temporary son I'm very permanent
Hittin' MC's like an intoxicant, sent to prevent
Monopoly is my intent, the means is what I invent
This mental murder pay the rent
Lyrically I'm the dominant ingredient, the swift extravagant
Smooth lubricant, down with the M-the-Ill-itant
 That's the sound of the Dynasty chant
We surround your camp, assumin' the war stance
And bring it from the chest, now let's dance

M-ILL-ITANT, feel the 5th guerilla chant
Y'all talk about bodies but you would not kill a ant
My skill is amp, would peel a nigga like a stamp
Caliber is of Excalibur now you be damp
When I operate a crowd will copulate
My game'll make a room populate and 2-1-5th is the stock of hate
Peep the logistics, slump your squad of misfits
They all get they wrists slit, blast your ass if you insist it
Leave no trace so there's no trace for ballistics
Turn your soul and body to statistics
In particular I've got that extracurricular
Squad in the stash who could be stickin' ya
Slip and they vickin' ya
Harass your po-lice commissioner
Don't like chicks with weaves talking 'bout, "I need conditioner"
That shit's deader than niggas with a morticianer
A jenazah, up in your flesh like plasma
Take away your last breath when you got asthma
Then meet Bad Lieu down at the plaza
Hip-hop extravaganza, tell your man I slump him with a stanza
Now "Who's the Boss?" not Tony Danza
My force not green but the force is obscene
P.O. took a piss test it came out not clean
Brody with my man Miz-Moose and Hakeem
My squad from deuce-four up to West Oak Lane
All the way to Takahwana and Frankfurt they know the name
It's like that M-Ill-itant

M-Ill-itant, lyrically hostile, Bad Lieutenant
Check it out, foul style check it out

We settin it from Southside, pushin this up North
From Illadelphian reps, to fly points across the map
Bring it back to Respond/React

Muffled sound of fist on flesh 
Blows to chest 
No breath 
Air gasps 
You ain't nothing but white trash, bitch! 
With each hit, each kick, each, broken rib 
Crack, crack! 
Bones are crying 
Mommy's crying and bleeding 
And pleading 
And then 
Daddy wants to fuck 
Dick hard, swelled with power rush 
And as if all that wasn't enough 
Mommy's seven months heavy with birth 
As, Daddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied ear 

First, lullaby 
First, son, will, ever, hear 
And never forget 

Mommy almost bled to death when she have him, finally 
She'd already lost, three 
Uterus-bruised, shredded, and weak 
From being daily beat 
And Friday nights were the worse and 
Daddy never came with flowers 
Instead he spent hours at some corner spot 
With some bar pop named Cookie 
Putting his thing down 
Soiling Mommy's sheets with
Sweet, talk shit, 
Cookie's cheap lipstick, 
Hair grease, sperm, and Jezebel juice 

To hell with the good news that
He was a father for the first time 
His thirst for wine and women 
Clouded his vision 
No warm welcome for mother and son 
Just 
The rank smell of ass-crack, funk, and cum 
But Mommy's prayerful strength-her best defense 
She, burned the dirty linens 
Made a fresh bed 
Laid sleeping First Son down 
And never made a sound 
As she purged her scourge 
With birth-blood and quiet tears 
Watching as her fears and love and sacrifice 
Lie there in his soft skin and new life 
Breathing, dreaming, fresh from God's eye 
Mommy's little survivor 
Like, her 

Mommy called crazy and scorned 
Cause she two more born 
One boy soon after 
The girl much later and 
Although they were both sung the same lullabies of hate 
Her, First Son, the first one 
Whose, womb-world was profaned 
Came of age playing street games 
With Stewie, Rezzie, and Little Brother 
'Till his heart start to wither 
In pain and shame 
Blamed Mom for the wrong she let Daddy do to her 
And him
Let, sins of the Father cause his innocence to wander 
Found out amongst thieves 
Chose to squander his dreams 
Stopped believing in himself 
Become prodigal with his life 
Make impossible shit right with
Gang-ties, crime, lies 
Erase wise, woeful words of Mother 
Replaced them with absurdities of others 
Who had also lost their way 

Played a different kind of street game now 
First Son plunged deep 
Speak street-family vows 
Espouse no causes but his own 
See, he couldn't protect Mommy's neck from Daddy's grasp 
Or, protect Mommy's ass from Daddy's wrath 
Couldn't shield her ears from
Daddy's foul-mouthed, liquor-breath jeers 
His only defense-served be confidence 
Brown bottles housed his swift descent 
Phones called cops on block frequent for his shenanigans 
Now, Daddy and him twins in addiction 
Driven to false-hearted heavens and friends 
By liquefied demons 
Had become what he despised from conception 'til end 
Destined for a demise 
Survived nine lives of staying high 
Conning, jewelry-pawning, arrests, theft 
Womanizing, only for money, never for sex 
Bullet in chest, baseball bat to the head 
Left for dead 
So, eyes wide and glassy 
Speech, slowed and slurred 
Lips twitched with caked-up codeine candy 
And mouth corners one December 24th 
Mr. Hide and False Friend 
Took final ride to suburban supplier 
Shots were fired by the gray man 
With shaky hand 
But not shaky enough to miss
Hit, Lost Boy in back 
So-called Friend runs for door 
Leaves First Son blood-born 
Lying alone in blood on cold floor 

Death was the cause of
Returning to Innocence Lost

Baby 'Sis awake for dawn on Christmas morn 
To Mommy's sobs and shakes 
Daddy's silhouettes of regret 
All past, omitted, and absolved by lost 
As they clung to each other 
Knowing

'Cause when I put rhymes in they minds yo
For all y'all folks who were hopin' and wishin'
And I can assault, tryin'a take my position
Stop wishin', and sit yourself back and listen to
A'yo, cause when I put rhymes in they minds yo
For all y'all folks who were hopin and wishin'
And I can assault, tryin'a take my position
Stop wishin', and sit your ass back

A'yo when I say pump that, y'all say shit up
Pump that! 
Pump that! 
When I say stand up, y'all say get up
Stand up! 
Stand up! 
When I say rise up, y'all say now
Rise up! 
Rise up! 
When I say lick a shot, say blaow
Lick a shot! 
Lick a shot! 

A'yo everybody on they jawns
Cartoons is hardcore porn
It ain't no after school paper routes and mowin' lawns
Kids got backpacks full of yayo and heron
Coming to school shootin' up the auditorium
Yo its anthrax maniacs on the TV
The least of y'all worries should be Thought's CD
The chairman of the board coppin' twice weekly
They done caught the minister with a pork b.l.t.
If my shit ain't hot, it probably try to drive me
Psyhce, its somethin' I can never let myself see
Can't see, I'm thorough-bread, nothin' fancy
The maker, no matter what the circumstance be
Its the principle, pillowcase full of nickel
Smacked like I'm ? leave him crippled
Keep talkin' greasey I'm a big lip you
A'yo your man'll can get slid with you
You and the squad takin to galoshes
I hold the engineer for hostage
And spit from a dirty cartridge
Its L for whoever try to front on Thought's shit
I'm sendin' them goons to your mom's apartment

A'yo when I say pump that, y'all say shit up
Pump that! 
Pump that! 
When I say stand up, y'all say get up
Stand up! 
Stand up! 
When I say rise up, y'all say now
Rise up! 
Rise up! 
When I say lick a shot, say blaow
Lick a shot! 
Lick a shot! 

A'yo I'm dancin', on the edge of insanity
And rhymin' like its the end of humanity
Still people from the old neighborhood can't stand to see me
Turn around and tell girls we like family
What up with all that, jokin', and collamity
Behind the laughter they thinkin' about jammin' me
But they don't know, I got somethin' for them
But I ain't with that negative vibe, so fuck all that
I've earned a lot from this game, and sacrificed more
Stand here a new man, but I'm still the old boy
They claimin' they sell but I'm still the old boss
Sometimes wings get clipped, we all hit the floor
But today though, its Black Thought, Kweli and Raw
You can be sure that we got our eyes on y'all
Watchin' different artists rise and fall
Mother fuckers jumpin' ship like we came to rob at y'all

A'yo when I say pump that, y'all say shit up
Pump that! 
Pump that! 
When I say stand up, y'all say get up
Stand up! 
Stand up! 
When I say rise up, y'all say now
Rise up! 
Rise up! 
When I say lick a shot, say blaow
Lick a shot! 
Lick a shot! 

Kweli, sittin' back in the cut like Reese
In a constant peace, call me fantastic like I cut the grease
Baracudas movin' and canoein sippin' amaretto
I'm a ruler of my temple, what I do to instrumentals
Instrumentals is the development of these niggas mentals
Tears in your eyes like this moment is sentimental
Your fundamentally floored, philosophically bored
Disturbed like the eighth floor of your hospital ward
You've GOT to appoint niggas to raise the bar
Muslims praise Allah, Christians praise the God
Rastas, they say Jah
They find a way to rhyme with the pallet like fine wine
And make you say ah
Guess who's back?
The game needed improvement
Can't fit the bullshit no more, you sound stupid
I'm a shark in the water with constant movement
Influenced by music since a truant yo
This is how we do it yo

A'yo when I say pump that, y'all say shit up
Pump that! 
Pump that! 
When I say stand up, y'all say get up
Stand up! 
Stand up! 
When I say rise up, y'all say now
Rise up!

We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on
Here we write on
We should shine a light on, a light on
And the book I write on, write on
Here we write on

Yo, I try to get it how I live it
A lot of people countin' on me kinda like a digit
It's a cold world; I'm not frontin' like it isn't
There's no time for comin' up shorter than a midget
Y'all know I'm-a raise the bar though like Bridgette
See every star go; don't blink--you might miss it
It's precious cargo--you gotta be strong to lift it
The light comes in different types; be more specific
Shit, I'm Blackthought--what could be more prolific?
For this love I go above and beyond the limit
I told y'all I'm above and beyond the gimmick
I get into your head and spread like a pandemic
I never put myself in a race I can't finish
I'm well grounded, founded on the same premise
As any man with a hit list, it's 'bout business
Yo, can a brother get a witness? Dig it; right on

A'ight, okay, I'm above and beyond hot
My measurement in watts
Time rate and flow of energy ain't never gonna stop
Pressure's on, I won't pop; microphone I won't drop
Gym stones, niggas copyin' shit if I ain't in the spot
It's the Orion that I hop, the new star to hit
I shine a light for the future so my presence's a gift
It's evident I'm Heaven-sent with Thomas Edison elements
Reverent for what I represent to show my benevolence
This is Dilly; I'm reppin' for the art of the city
Came from Southwest Atlantic and gave my heart to the city
Where slugs fly, thugs cry 'cause every part of it's gritty
Niggas shootin' up the club like they party with Diddy
You pick the diggy; I put my incandescence to fluorescence
And an essence I convert with  for energy per second
I put 'em on the lessons while I'm smokin' on a pleasant
A switch hitter like Pete Rose, right at the session
Right on

Hello hello hello hello

Every anywhere heights plains peaks or valleys
Entrances exits vestibules and alleys
Winding roads that test the firm nerve
Fortune or fatal behind the blind curve
The engine oil purr lights flash to a blur
Speed work through the earth make your motor go scurr!
Tonight at noon watch a bad moon rising
Identities in crisis and conflict diamonds
Blindin' staring at lights till they cryin'
Bone gristle popping from continuous grindin'
Grapes of wrath in a shapely glass
Ingredients influential on your ways and acts
Zero tolerance to raise the tax
It don't matter how your gates is latched
You ain't safe from the danger jack
Made it way before they made the map
Or a G-P-S this is D-E-F leader

I know where I'm goin' even when its dark and being led down that road
Hello hello hello hello
You don't see that somethings wrong earth's spinnin' outta control
Hello hello hello hello
Everything's for sale even souls someone get God on the phone
Hello hello hello hello
Northside nigga Southside
Hello hello hello hello
Shits poppin' off Worldwide
Hello hello hello hello

Between the greenhouse gases and earth spinnin' off its axis
Got mother nature doin' back flips the natural disasters
Its like 80 degrees in Alaska you in trouble if u not an Onasis
It ain't hard to tell that the conditions is drastic
Just turn on the telly check for the news flashin'
How you want it bagged paper or plastic
Lost in translation or just lost in traffic
Yo I don't wanna floss I done lost my passion
And I ant trying to climb yo I lost my traction
They makin' me break my contents under pressure
Do not shake I'm workin' while the boss relaxin'
Here come Mr. tax man he leavin' a fraction give me back some
Matter fact next pay check it's like that son
I'll fuck around and have to hurt a few men
They probably chalk it up as a disturbing new trend hello

I know where I'm goin' even when its dark and being led down that road
Hello hello hello hello
You don't see that somethings wrong earth's spinnin' outta control
Hello hello hello hello
Everything's for sale even souls someone get God on the phone
Hello hello hello hello
Northside nigga Southside
Hello hello hello hello
Shits poppin' off Worldwide
Hello hello hello hello

Should I say hello or should I say that hell is low
And my nigga are niggaro I'm an African American
They sell drugs in the hood but the man he move the medicine
He'll prescribe you Augmen for everything
A little stuffy nose tell you get some Claritin
You know I'm hip to it and its hard to claim the land
When my great great great grands were shipped to it
Look at technology they call it downloading
I call it downsizing somebody follow me
Does a computer chip have an astrology
And when it fuck up could it give you an apology
Could it
Should it say hello or should it say goodbye
Try to understand how smart and how hood am I, It don't matter though
Until we learn that the world don't turn right ,we all oughta the scatter though

I know where I'm goin' even when its dark and being led down that road
Hello hello hello hello
You don't see that somethings wrong earth's spinnin' outta control
Hello hello hello hello
Everything's for sale even souls someone get God on the phone
Hello hello hello hello

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long
So I told her I got something you've been waiting for
I got something you've been waiting for

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying, I walked up and asked what's wrong, she told me that
The radio's been playing the same song all day long
So get your glass lift it up in the toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused with it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We not the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga
Well I'm a downtown shoota who that?
The crown ruler is back
He congruent to the shape of a mack
Look how I do it yo I'm takin' you back
This how you rise down to the foundation how sacred is that?
I'm from the number one place on the map
The generational gap with yet another sensational track
And we don't stress for nothing I just press the button
It's as simple as just makin' it hap
To all the frauds stop fakin' relax
And to the broads if you cakin'
Then clap then shake it without breakin' your back
I know the world been waitin' for that you been aching fa that
Cause what they playin' on the station is wack
And I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque my squad is so fresh
You know its Black Thought and your boy the Bro Quest, but

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long

So get your glass lift it up and in toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We got the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga so lets go

Hip-Hop ain't dead cause the pulse is in us
I got the everclear flow they mimosa wit it
We are the hope of the culture they posed to listen
And I'm posed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league, I'm Oden wit it
Yet don't owe them niggas nothin' but potent lyrics
But if you ain't gotta dance they revoke your spinnin'
So good rappers ain't eatin' they Olsen twinin'
But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar
With the counterfeit hitters they so so with it but they a Sosa with it.
They Mark McGuire with the writtin' I'm Rodriguez
On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hittin'
This is the trial and error era no co defendant
I push the seed every time like I'm Cody wit it
I said they one hit wonders pneumonia to us
I don't know you niggas hit the road my nigga

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long

So get your glass lift it up and in toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We got the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga so lets go

Where my grimey figures at? look lively addressing the captain
Show me where your first impression is at
And where your dedication to the true profession is at
How you laugh answer me what kind of question is that
I'll show you where my rare essence is at the adolescence of rap
The real muscle in the message of that
My name trouble I'm a blessin' to rap
And you can check my stats cause worldwide they attesting to that
So nigga listen you can probably learn a lesson perhaps
How I'm like bobby DeNiro Joe Pesc and them cats
Am I the unsung hero oh yes if you askin' anybody that's aware of the classics
They'll tell you I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque my squad? so fresh
You know its Black Thought and your boy the bro Quest, but

Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long

So get your glass lift it up and in toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We got the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
So lets go

Rock you
Come on

Ayo y'all rappers less play, what I'm about to say
Will probably hit y'all niggas in a real strange way
Shmucks, ducks and half hearted prankster crews
Willie dank Langston Hughes, put shanks in crews
I debut to make the news and I've been killing it since
Still in the trench, buzzin' off the killin' dispense
I want my niggas out that barbwire still in the fence
Verbal assassin I'm a killer still in a sense
Rhymes is graphic
Aimin' straight at your minds and blast that weak shit
The pieces and particles of fragments mad vocabulist
Yes I must confess
I'm like Diddy tryin' to sink a slug in Elliots chest
Just taste on that it's Black you can tally up that
You never knew that fate cut you until your belly was wet
New Delian cat the Fraggle Rock skully is split it's Black comin'
You can tell it's a hit, comin' to drop you nigga

We will rock you

Yo y'all savages is primitive
I'm true penmanship
Here come the neuro-linguistic rhyme hypnotist
Making sound waves
Prisoners outta the listeners
Legendary magnificent Pope distributors
Man I remain lives ahead of the game
Slang play off the meter cause its never the same
Niggas tell me how they never comin' better then frame
They love what I say
Here come the rebel breaking the frame and it's all true
My earning bars arts is martial
I'm comin' to off you
I ain't tryin' to argue
When you least expect it I'm gonna step out the
darkroom pull out the hardware tools the particles will spark you
My niggas wraps give a slice
I spit nice fucking around this twice
As much as rhythm is rolling a dice
To choose one the noose or the gun
Cause you're getting banged or hanged
Thought second to none nigga

Rock you
Come on

Yo check it out whether you ballin' or just one the
wall and groovin' groovin'
We've come to get it kickin' and get the movement movin'
For Tracey and Tamika and for Shelly and Susan
Styles make you wonder what the hell he was usin'
Remember your development with out any music
Spit so many spears it's becoming a nuisance to some
But to whoever want to know who the truth is
You never heard another on the mic as ruthless
I drink a little liquor a lot of water and juices
It make money ain't no need for makin' excuses
Burn you fuckin' with a South Philly exclusive
Them long dick niggas with real short fuses that go off
Chick likes Riq, you such a show off
You cut your locks down to a fro than cut your fro off
I been at your show there ain't no way to cut your flow off
You got to be the illest emcee that people know of word

I will rock you

Rock you
Come on

Rock you

Downtown everybody move to the beat
Uptown everybody moving the heat
Cross-town the party where both sides meet
Eastside, westside, there's always beef
Downtown everybody move to the beat
Uptown everybody moving the heat
Cross-town the party where both sides meet
Eastside, westside, there's always beef

I tattoo the page with the permanent ink
Mr. Rourke on your Fantasy Island
The umbrella in your tropical drinks
Still run it up it, liquor in your cup
Fucking you up
Hang over the banister
You feel the rush of the blood going straight to your brain
Ain't no love, you only love bringing hate to the game
Taking my name in vain, mistaking license for freedom
He make music for the people, people dying to meet him
People!
We still abuse it, while the rich is made of music
He probably driving a Buick and be rocking van--- ?
G-you-E relevant, see how his man do it
Fucking with niggas from illa fifth, see how we ran through it
The river in the valley
The nigga in the alley
Rolling with the heat from BK to killer Cali
The hands will fake the clapping
You'll be collasping
You softer than the land on legs
Transforming the landscape
Like a sandstorm in the Sahara
I am the truest nigga
I do more shows than The Roots to Carol Lewis
Creative artist, never play the targets of game hunters
You may want to test this product like cane smugglers
Dis disco shit
Popping like Crisco
Hitting your face
Spit in your face like pistol shit
My style, wild like wipple whip
I go back like a pistol grip
It's pro-black, Kweli!

Downtown everybody move to the beat
Uptown everybody moving the heat
Cross-town the party where both sides meet
Eastside, westside, there's always beef
Downtown everybody move to the beat
Uptown everybody moving the heat
Cross-town the party where both sides meet
Eastside, westside, there's always beef

I'm a threat like Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
Willy gank, spit the killer dank dialogue
Pyro-maniac like Dr. Molotov
I knock the bottle off
And knock the model off
Gots some non-believers here
Some how I'll save y'all
Or stop y'all worries, you makin me vexed
Hit up gekko, this ain't got gold correct
I'll fucking bounty hunt your body like I'm Boba Fett
Cause you a toy not a soldier yet
You better hold your neck
You dick smokers get no respect
With the blood, ice your watch, rock your rocks
Better rock it on the screen and not the blocks
'cause them crews don't stop them shots
It's so many that fly,  they chase down, I just stop and watch
I'm from the south side of philly, it's known to get gruesome
Heavy hitter villians these alleyways produce them
Heavy hitter on a pocket we find a way to juice them
They may as well pay, schmuck
Introducing the be	-to L-A see me the king splitter
Then analyze this dime, the main thing glitter
Then analyze the taste in your mouth, it seem bitter
Ganster, valid dick torian, graduate of I dare you
If you are paper thin I'm a tear you
I'm a come take care of you put a part in your hairdo
You barking like I'm a starting to scare you
But speak up like a man nigga so your body guards can hear you

Downtown everybody move to the beat
Uptown everybody moving the heat
Cross-town the party where both sides meet
Eastside, westside, there's always beef
Downtown everybody move to the beat
Uptown everybody moving the heat
Cross-town the party where both sides meet
Eastside, westside, there's always beef

Yo I trash you, smash you from the state's capital 
All you see is flashing lights 
A whole community ready to fight 
One thousand MC's attack the mic 
Nubians died and came back to life 
Most of ya'll ant to a gaint, so try me 
Don't you see the danger signs? 
Niggas I've dared slimy 
I give the chant and the youth fam a rain dance around me 
I make it storm and thunder 
When you from amongst us 
Dig your boots, roll up the ? on your tomb 
Going with shrooms, rhymes starin at the moon 
I set the sun in early afternoons 
Send out signals to get you back in tune 
All light weight niggas will get vacuumed 

 
I hit this mid-life crisis ten years before thirty 
And stay in time, fuck fair ones, we fight dirty 
We rally in the shadows of night and strike early 
While your sight blurry, the blind fury 
Fifth cal-vary 
We to the rescue 
Then rhyme battle like them crime battles depress too 
Bullets in the wall of your chest too 
And plus whoever you standin next to 
The ambu-lance will come and collect you 
I ripped you with the dart 
Sect' true with the art 
It's deeper than your classical Mozart 
Your pop or R&B charts 
Can never see Thought flows, is on some Philly shit 
Murder one penmanship, the uninnocent 
Cul-prit, MC's is insulted 
And my affiliates/Aphillyates is high voltage 

 
I walk through the smog with the fog light on in the morning 
No ? without warning, I'm brain storming 
Sketch the blueprint, lookin through tinted to mutant 
Cause disorderly nusiance with pollutants 
Advance on your stance, incite a cobra in October 
Combine minds will take you over even when it's cold out 

Whatever you say don't matter, disrespect and get splattered 
The fact that you sunnin lotta niggas got me flattered 
When they heard it was me, they all scattered 
Notts Family love practice, we cock back for satisfaction 
Pull on wear and bulletproofs is the fashion 
On stings, we stackin 
And fifty raid the crib, we stil clappin 
We tear the club up from state to state 
Bouncin back to the bullet state, holdin the eight 
Like Onyx, we Shut Em Down 
Wack crews, we lay em down 
We all organizing, while you idolizing 
And when the guns bust, it's the bullets that you can't trust 
Kiss the barrel on your knees before I ripped you up 
Aphillyation and The Roots, c'mon give it up 
Wit these lyrics that'll hit you from your nuts up 

Quest the barber, last illest rhyme author 
If I can't catch you, best believe my ill squad'll off ya 
Wit the sparker, seven shot departure 
Five of those caught ya 
Sneak attack competition I taught ya 
Any conflict I come equipped 
Swift with the riot spit 
Makin cats backflip from my vocals in this rap shit 
Where fake rappers get capped shit 
Found in the dumpster with they cap's split 
Double check, you shoulda packed it 
Empty clips ain't never clapped shit 
Retaliation, you lacked it 
Now your back's against the wall, plastered 

Ditto, this is that shit that got six fillin our vest 
?? fillin our chest, cuz when hell's lit, we the best 
You ever heard in this shit, we spit degrees 
That'll freeze, melt, and bring life to the shit 
Yo like atoms we split, eye to eye we sit 
Declare war within, defeatin war with men 
Now who can beat us 
When you was watered 
Our mens tore it down, start settin up shop 
It's building blocks, now the cops can't stop what we got 
It's too HOT 
Locals hassle niggas till they drop 
Get caught up in spots and what not 
But we dead not 
Can't hit us with beams or glocks 
I'm afraid not cuz all the above said and said not

Listen, I got you phobic offa this like arachnids
Drastic, it ain't plastic, it's just pro blackness
Grown man tactics no pediatrics
The kind of track that make the comeback miraculous
The catalyst. Thought with the knack of splashin'
I'm dashin', I mastered the craft of mashin'
The level-headed thoroughbred the females passion
Magnetic attraction be keeping em askin'

The crews in the Cadillac, the Pendergrassin'
Swerve half-naked won't come near crashin'
But if I go to Heaven would ya'll know my name
Or would it be the same for you like I was Eric Clapton, huh?
Clap for your freedom dog, that's what's happenin'
My spit take critical political action
The hustle is a puzzle, each piece is a fraction
And every word that's understood is a transaction
I'm an S.P. soldier, microphone holder
Rep Philly set
From Bolivia to Boulder
Paris, France to Tip and Thai Yoga
How we gon' make it through the dark?
I'll show ya.

Tell you one lesson I've learned
If you want to reach something in life
You ain't gonna get it unless
You give a little bit of sacrifice
Ooh sometimes before you smile you got to cry
You need a heart that's filled with music
If you use it you can fly
Listen,
If you want to be high

Yo kick off ya shoes, jump off the jock
I fly higher than them dudes from off ya block
My name Black, the style is unorthodox
It tap chins wit ya men's who you thought could box
A couple people wanted thought to stop
But guess what?
My man grab the missile, plug for the gut
Now next time greedy stop being such a glut
I'm precise with it like Faheim with haircuts
We up close on 'em with toast but no crust
It's fructose on 'em they froze and won't bust
Choke on your face you jewels is lackluster
Gotta put it to ya straight
Y'all fools is jacked up
Came close to the utmost but no cogar
Nose to the grindstone, head to the stars
The number one runner with the number one drummer
Grammy award-winning it's the world's eighth wonder
Come on!

Yo, your first impression might be I'm a asshole
Or say I'm sometimey and give people a hassle
Or try to suntouch and put the heat in a capsule
Dog I'm far deeper than that though,
I get in the zone, recognize I'm a rolling stone
No time to lollygag or lounge with scallywags
Gimme the disc or I'll put it where your body at
Old school spit flow laid over Trotter tracks
With no apology, fraud or tricknology
Just trust what I see and I say and follow me
My way, I be the open book, look inside me
The star of the story that the grooveteller guide me
Through all the dark times part of the business
The light be contingent on small forensics
My microphone'll make a man a newborn infant
It's true so the true gon' sense it
I get in the zone

y'all know the dynasty, the Roots repertoire
The lieutenant from the reservoir, serve the spar
The injurar, preditar of a competitar
I send MCs where the paramedics are
At first, I'm like "nah", I'm nonchalant from afar
Then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
With irregular balance of the cat burgla-rar
Known to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars
I know the flavor because me and the thugs minds are mutual
We congruent, lay on the corner with the trauma unit
I'm from the lab where the bomb's distributed
So never try to duplicate the skills executed
Son you'd get electrocuted from the worldwide reputed
Shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it
Some know me as the man that's from the Roots crew
Others as the bad lieutenant of Snyder Avenue
We go an eye for an eye
Behead like a samurai that'll command the dynasty until he die
Who will imply that I lack a-biliti?
Make your words known, amplify the you-tiliti
I'm crooked like the "I" on a toxic malt liquor
The land whipper, the Dom Perignon champ sipper
The fifth'll bring it all together like the zipper on a butter leather
The bad lieu a bring the bad weather
So to whoever got riff, let it rest
Reflect, then recollect on the way it was set
It's the veteran architect that flows with the rhythm of sex
Be on the low shotgun in the Lex
With my man low to flex
I'm restin where they handle the Tecs
And the lyrical vandal is next flow
So my man, my mizza, my man
M-ilitant, what's the master plan?
Once again

Peep the oratory, niggaz bore me with theatrics
Moms listen to they daughter story about my packets
The adverse is on your table, stabilize emotion
A soldier at ease, but on post of up most in
Brag and boast in my anecdotes that choke
Invade your whole terrain, you feel the pain provoke
When I breaststroke your wavelength of intensity
My alliance bring forth to you an entity
Your whole vicinity, I contaminate with hate
Got no time to debate, but hold up wait, sit straight
It's in mil, the elicit, you violate, you get a ticket
MCs you can't tell I expel, you get evicted
From out your misery, serve your ass with my delivery
Allah makes the ground you steppin' on shivery
Permanent tears run through your thoughts you queers
It's all upstairs, where there's a crowd, table and chairs
For years, been on the mic, I'm like a dike with stairs
When I strike, I stay severe, niggaz stay low in they glare
From over here, my Range Rover square to blast offside
Switch the pitch from southpaw to unorthodox
I shock your brain with the miscellaneous
Who beez the zaniest, nigga with words that are spontaneous?

A yo, the purpose mainly is to generate the Luther Van
Lyrical contraband, controllin' your command and

All the way live from two fifteen, all the way live from the six ten
Gettin' cash, get the gusto
One time, it's the dynasty flow
Runnin' it down the line, it's another
Yeah, you in tune to another ill
Fifth dynasty production baby

Knocked up nine months ago
And what she's fittin' to have she don't know
She wants neo soul cause hip hop is old
She don't want no rock'n roll
She want platinum, ice and gold
She want a whole lot of somethin' to fold
If you're an obstacle she'll just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary's bad
In these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told the girl look here
Calm down I'm gonna hold your hand
To enable you to keep the plan
Because you're quick to learn
And we can make money to burn
If you allow me the latest game
I don't ask for much but enough to room to spread my wings
And a world fittin' to know my name, just listen to me

I don't ask, for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow standin' where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lovers behind my lovers back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary dropped my baby girl tonight I would name her rock 'n roll

Cadillac needs space to roam
Where we headin' for she don't know
We in the city where the pro shake rattle 'n roll
And I'm a god dang rollin' stone
I don't beg I can hold my own
I don't break I can hold a chrome
And it's weighin' a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is the only one
And Black Thought is bad
These streets he done ran ever since when the game began
I never played the fool
Matter of fact I've been keeping it cool
Since money been changin' hands
And I'm left to shine, the legacy I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread these wings
And a world fittin' to know my name, now listen to me

I don't beg from a rich man
And I don't scream and kick when his shit don't fall in my handsman
Cause I know how to still
Fertilize another against my lovers will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Oh you know the deal you'll be keeping my legend alive
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight I would name her rock 'n roll

Oh break it down, down for me
I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've takin' my test
Deliverin' Mary it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it rock 'n roll

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her rock 'n roll
I would name her rock 'n roll
I would name her rock 'n roll

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Yo, I had a Queen named Amina, height 5'7"
Caramel-complected, body like heaven
Met her through the sister of my man Big Vince
Like some shit from out the flicks we been in love ever since
She called me her chocolate brotha, I call her my sugar sista
Knew Shorty could work it since before I ever kissed her
I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit
But because sex she wasn't with, she started flippin an' shit
Like, "Listen man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and
That game is weak and keep tryin to hit I could quit speakin'
Tariq in fact, you bein BlackThought don't get ya closer
I dig ya but won't bone ya because I'm so-called supposed ta
Most o' them would, but that couldn't be me, that's not my flava
Go home and think about that, maybe later on I'll page ya"
I contemplated, and then concluded she was bluffin'
Steady pursuin' screwin', gettin' nothin' but the silent treatment

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Crazy frustration, about my lovin' situation
When patience was a virtue, but I wasn't used to waitin'
I want some Marvin Gaye healin', feelin' is real inside
I slip and slide, my ride'll keep you occupied, I'd
Love to get wit it like that, but my baby's kitty cat's capped
And locked, Love Boat is docked at the shore
And what for? Later for groupies on tour
Why won't my sugar call me no more?
I mean, my Queen gets upset, rejectin' and sexually neglect
Then sayin' I'm more sewer than Das EFX, and closed-minded
It's like I'm blinded by the skinnin'
I'm into women; because of that, this one's into communication
Temptation played the vandal, freakin' my brain, my mind
Rippin' the handle on physically scandalous acts
Yo! She knew what I wanted, but she fronted
Bust it

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Well umm
Movin' right along with the song, plus the strong
Feelings on my mind, desire to intertwine
Combine and blend, baby bust a message that I send
Ain't no need to pretend, cause shit is real til the end
I provide a place to hide from crime, hard times
And livin' trife, while I open ya mind, you're in my life
Like love, it ain't no way no one can rise above what's real
That's why I'm feelin' like you're makin' me bugged
I puff an El on fifty deuce while I walk in the rain
Heart feelin' killa pain while I hop the train
Dial her number to the rest, and ain't no messages left
Regardless, my chest thumps from stress, yo it's a mess
I don't know what I got to do to make you understand
I'm for real and that's no question, no frontin' or no guessin'
Undressin', carressin', in the span, that I contain in my hand
Could touch and make you say that I'm such a man
And call my name, so let me set your body aflame
I'll never treat you like a dame or run game
Now who's to blame?
I know you're not a hoe for niggaz with a lot of dough
But I just wanted you to know

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Girl you know that you need
To stop givin' me the silent, treatment baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I want to love you constantly, but you keep neglecting me
And treating me silently

Days are living fast, moves in misery
You got a song you wanna sing for me
Sing a song, singing man
Sing a song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing a song for me
Sing a song for me

Look, I'm so twisted, so, so twisted
One life to live, and I'm willing to risk it
Terror that the world has never known existed
Left so many clues, now how could they miss it?
Sadistic, ballistic, find a word and pick it
Long as it means the world is on my shit list
Walking time bomb, my mind is on tick-tick
Countdown's on, its too late to nix it
I'm so anxious, so, so anxious
The ones I hate barely know what my name is
Have no clue that I'm armed and dangerous
Willing to spill my blood to be famous
Willing to spill my blood to make changes
Look for a suicide note to explain this
Heinous, inking the ache from my anguish
Sounds insane, you're speaking my language

One for the pressing, two for the cross
Three for the blessing, four for the loss
Kid holding a weapon, walk like a corpse
In the face of transgression, military issue Kalash
Nikova or machete or a pitchfork
He killing cause he feel he got nothing to live for
In a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor
And never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer
13-year-old killer, he look 35
He changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive
When he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly
He loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes
Who to blame, its a shame, the youth was demonized
Wishing he could see rearrange the truth, to see the lies
And he wouldn't have to raise his barrel to target you
His heart can't give you the years of scar tissue...

Uh, what you're witnessing is true dedication
Charged by the call and the cause of the nation
Countdown, minutes away from detonation
A lifetime of grunt work, this is the culmination
My manner, seems patient, inner rage lies
So deep, I can taste it, let's sacrifice lives
Past the first sensation, to paradise I fly
Delusions are lighting up the midday sky
The last days of mine spent in extreme secrecy
Wolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently
Too much faith to be scared, the petrified both fled
Those who live fearing death, might as well be dead
Towers of the occupiers, will soon fall
Martyr or mass murderer? That's your call
Mass transit or a mall? Who can watch them all?
In the name of the merciful, sing me a song

Like when autumn leaves fall
Down from the trees
There goes my honey bee
I've lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn't wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep
I'm dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am, all that I was is history
The past unraveled, adding insult to this injury
I'm fighting the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake
It's unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally
Oh, there I go, from a man to memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me

I've lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn't wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

Somebody's gotta be there when it gets ugly
Somebody's gotta be there when it gets bloody
Somebody's gotta get their hands dirty
Yo, it's a fucked up job but somebody's gotta do it

Somebody's gotta come up with a plan
And be there when the shit hits the fan
I hope y'all out there understand
Look man it's a fucked up job, but somebody's gotta do it

Yeah y'all, ideal for a lyrical perfectionist
Raw, that's what every soldier in my collective is
Thought, control level is that of a gold medalist
My level headedness make it come off so effortless

The rebel is a opposite extreme of devilish
Back setting it with the answer to your deficit
My track record is hot shit, consecutive
Smug, I got game just like a record executive

A kiss to the feminine girls loving a gentlemen
A genius slash gangsta with a skill for swindling
Bet on Black
Bet these cats that's all gelatin

Will fall back spittin' them raps that's unintelligent
Raps that cap, rabid rattlin' out the gattlin'
Crippling rhymes whistlin' past, blow you back in
Smellin' your blood now I'm huntin'

Blowin' your front in for frontin' what up cousin?
Oh, now it's nothin'
Yo, you can't go beyond a point of no returning
I flip like my name Turner

That's for certain nigga, Ted Turner, Nat Turner, nigga Ike Turner
The raw sojourner for truth
The mic burner

Mic malevolence defies violence I inherited
Others just rentin' it like rooms at the Sheraton
I gotta jones like Vanessa in the devil in-
And y'all cold like a show in the Netherlands

Cold shoulders and frozen aortic valves -
So I don't form pals - conform to norms - morals different
Gifted - use it to shift shit a mutant shape shifter when I spit it I'm liquid
You could lick a million shots at the character of the body shell

They'll just richochette nigga aura's hard as hell
Before there was ain't hard to tell
The mic's cycle coincided right with mine as well
Since a minor I walked with the spine upstraight

I learned to rhyme to feed the dinner plate
I scraped barrel - even dined up on wine and steaks
'Cause in the bone same marrow that apartheid chased
The narrow margin with the haves and the have nots

Will get smaller as I approach - so watch your stash box
Fox logo if your fave is local
Get bruised till you're the color of the Laker's logo
This is work niggas

I made it - ain't nobody believe in me
But this rap game is like selling coke legally
Ain't no innovations - that takes concentration
nigga's celebrating not knowing the time they wasting

Killin' mics is one of my aesthetics
Rip very live so I'm an entertainer like Cedric
Shit they play on radio's now give me a headache
Can't slow me down I know where I'm headed

The profit on kill if you let it
nigga's feeling energetic
want to rumble - guns will come out
Here come the paramedics

I'm just trying to live like I've Devin
Tired of my people failin'
We all sin - the devil, what di I tell em
Somebody gotta get their hands dirty and shoes muddy

I see things vividly, y'all vision is blurry
Even if you hate - through my music you gone love
Everybody with me and they was with me when it was ugly

Somebody's gotta be there when it gets ugly
Somebody's gotta be there when it gets bloody
Somebody's gotta get their hands dirty
Yo, it's a fucked up job but somebody's gotta do it

Somebody's gotta come up with a plan
And be there when the shit hits the fan
I hope y'all out there understand
Look man it's a fucked up job, but somebody's gotta do it

Yeah y'all, ideal for a lyrical perfectionist
Raw, that's what every soldier in my collective is
Thought, control level is that of a gold medalist
My level headedness make it come off so effortless

The rebel is a opposite extreme of devilish
Back setting it with the answer to your deficit
My track record is hot shit, consecutive
Smug, I got game just like a record executive

A kiss to the feminine girls loving a gentlemen
A genius slash gangsta with a skill for swindling
Bet on Black
Bet these cats that's all gelatin

Will fall back spittin' them raps that's unintelligent
Raps that cap, rabid rattlin' out the gattlin'

I see things vividly, y'all vision is blurry
Even if you hate - through my music you gone love
Everybody with me and they was with me when it was ugly

In town 

Something in the way of things
Something that will quit and won't start
Something you know but can't stand
Can't know get along with
Like death
Riding on top of the car peering through the windshield for his cue
Something entirely fictitious and true
That creeps across your path hallowing your evil ways
Like they were yourself passing yourself not smiling
The dead guy you saw me talking to is your boss
I tried to put a spell on him but his spirit is illiterate

I know things you know and nothing you don't know
'cept I saw something in the way of things
Something grinning at me and I wanted to know, was it funny?
Was it so funny it followed me down the street
Greeting everybody like the good humor man
But an they got the taste of good humor but no ice cream
It was like dat
Me talking across people into the houses
And not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks
You could see them
But they looked like important Negroes on the way to your funeral
Looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction
And let them chant the number and use an ivory pointer to count your teeth
Remember Steppen Fetchit
Remember Steppen Fetchit how we laughed
An all your Sunday school images giving flesh and giggling
With the ice pick high off his head
Made ya laugh anyway

I can see something in the way of our selves
I can see something in the way of our selves
That's why I say the things I do, you know it
But its something else to you

Like that job
This morning when you got there and it was quiet
And the machines were yearning soft behind you
Yearning for that nigga to come and give up his life
Standin' there bein' dissed and broke and troubled

My mistake is I kept sayin' "that was proof that God didn't exist"
And you told me, "nah, it was proof that the devil do"
But still, its like I see something I hear things
I saw words in the white boy's lying rag

Said he was gonna die poor and frustrated
That them dreams walk which you 'cross town
S'gonna die from over work
There's garbage on the street that's tellin' you you ain't shit

And you almost believe it
Broke and mistaken all the time
You know some of the words but they ain't the right ones
Your cable back on but ain't nothin' you can see

But I see something in the way of things
Something to make us stumble
Something get us drunk from noise and addicted to sadness
I see something and feel something stalking us

Like and ugly thing floating at our back calling us names
You see it and hear it too
But you say it got a right to exist just like you and if God made it
But then we got to argue

And the light gon' come down around us
Even though we remember where the  is
Remember the Negro squinting at us through the cage
You seen what I see too?

The smile that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks
You see something too but can't call its name

Ain't it too bad why'all said
Ain't it too bad, such a nice boy always kind to his motha
Always say good morning to everybody on his way to work
But that last time before he got locked up and hurt, real bad

I seen him walkin' toward his house and he wasn't smiling
And he didn't even say hello
But I knew he'd seen something
Something in the way of things that it worked on him like it do in will

And he kept marching faster and faster away from us
And never even muttered a word
Then the next day he was gone
You want to know what

You want to know what I'm talkin' about
Sayin' "I seen something in the way of things"
And how the boys face looked that day just before they took him away
The is? in that face and remember now, remember all them other faces

And all the many places you've seen him or the sister with his child
Wandering up the street
Remember what you seen in your own mirror and didn't for a second recognize
The face, your own face

Straining to get out from behind the glass
Open your mouth like you was gon' say somethin'
Close your eyes and remember what you saw and what it made you feel like
Now, don't you see something else

Something cold and ugly
Not invisible but blended with the shadow criss-crossing the old man
Squatting by the drug store at the corner
With is head resting uneasily on his folded arms
And the boy that smiled and the girl he went with

And in my eyes too
A waving craziness splitting them into the jet stream of a black bird
Wit his ass on fire
Or the solomNOTness of where we go to know we gonna be happy

I seen something
I SEEN something
And you seen it too
You seen it too
You just can't call it's name name name name name name name

In town 

Something in the way of things
Something that will quit and won't start
Something you know but can't stand
Can't know get along with

Get 'em up high okay, yeah

Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, we proud of y'all
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, okay

When that adrenaline get in they system
It get 'em out on a quest for stardom, could be a mother fuckin' problem
In Philly, Cincinnati, Los Angeles or Harlem
Kids call themselves killers let they hammers do the talkin'
Don't even know the meaning of life, ain't seen a thing
And you dream of floodin' the scenery with, yayo and greenery
But for now, you stickin' her with the heavy machinery
Wonder how, you lift it up, be only 17
And like everybody he want to shine, young brothers on the grind
Holdin' something in their spine, "Bowling for Columbine"
Stressin' to me how it's all about a dollar sign
Dig the way you out of line, out of sight and out of mind
Up against the clock and damn near out of time
"The Tipping Point" has arrived, and that's the bottom line
To all my peoples that are stars, it's our time to shine
Let's get 'em up high, c'mon

Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, we proud of y'all
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, okay

Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, we proud of y'all
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, okay

Yo, ain't it strange how the newspapers play with the language
I'm deprogrammin' y'all with uncut slang shit
I know some peoples in the party armed and dangerous
Twist some cool champagne, I'm goin' through changes
A grown-ass man, I done paid my dues
Learn the rules lil' homey, you could be one too
Niggas know, ain't no tellin' what he gonna' do
But recognize young bro, I'mma do it for you
You know why?  We're all stars and we highly evolved
Hip-Hop, it's not pop like Kylie Minogue
If it bang, them gettin' busy brothers probably involved
In the game, where everybody got a shottie to draw
I guess you probably a thug, you boss ballin' or what?
I can't call it man, I got the ladies fallin' in love
Cause handsome, intelligent, tough I'm all the above
I know you knew it it's the movement
Groove to it while you doin' it up

Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, we proud of y'all
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, okay

Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, we proud of y'all
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, okay

Introducing the band you gotta see to believe
He got the mic in his hand, so keep the heat up your sleeve
It's Black Thought, he rockin' sharp so the speakers'll bleed
I run a triathlon, you wouldn't see me fatigued
I'm a star, and maybe y'all should cop something to be
Or trade some of y'all equipment in for something you need
Cause it's a, lot of bullshit floodin' the scene
Where everybody's a star, and hot shit is few and far between
We lose the grip of what, garbage mean
Shorties want to be themselves, I know it's hard to be
Don't want to do the Ruben Studdard and come off less threatening
Keepin' it real I'll kill you if you end up lettin' it
Ain't it blowin' your mind how the game all in line
Now the best, to the rest, we fin' to end up settin it
I'd tell you that I was a veteran but it's evident
You act like you want it, you gonna' end up gettin' it

Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, we proud of y'all
You got the, Roots crew with the sound of course
High, lift 'em up high, okay

Go all-star, and get down for yours
To the ladies in the house, we proud of y'all

Everybody is a star

Bass for your face, highs for your eyes
Don't blink, Black Ink has arrived, all rise
Rudebwoys keep dem thing at your side, be alright
Muh'fuckers Philly we up in here, we all live
I'm puffin this Cohiba mami coolin' her heels
All she ever seem to do is play it cool f'real
She be pushin', pop vessel, and her shoes is ill
But her hand, keep slippin on the woodgrain wheel
But it's cool, we never slippin' when there's moves to make
Especially when what we talkin' ain't ya usual cake
I pump bass for y'all bathin' apes, to get charged
Nah, I'm not a dealer, I'm a poet at large
We in the wind with the roof back, lettin' the breeze hit us
The bathrobe on with sweatpants and slippers
Comin' to pay a visit to whoever on the hit list
Some of y'all been tryin' for years, you'll never get this fool

Check it out  stay cool daddy 
Stay cool ma  c'mon

There it is 

Hip-Hop my main bitch, I got a few on the side
The game stitched y'all I'm doin' my job
Go up against enormous odds
Wouldn't break a sweat, money make her bet
Funny son you threat, well I ain't shakin' yet
Twenty-fo'/sev' chillin', tougher than penicillin
From the block where the crooked cops killin' like a villain
Children, in the hood gettin' rocked by they buildings
And brothers, 'cross the board gettin' knocked by the millions
The stress, got me ignitin' the potent marijuana leaf
Tryin' to play it cooler than a polar bear colony
You feel the music know I'm over there probably
Pimpin on the same system that forever shorted me
I got the soul of a young Sam Cooke when I spit
It make you want to make a new dance up
It's all to the good shorty 'gwan do that stuff
It's not another sound system rockin steady as us
And it's cool

 yeah  stay cool ha
 check it out, and just
 yeah

Yeah, when I'm crusin' in my vehicle, the chase harass me
They never ride past me, they really comin' at me right
They want to know where the drugs guns and cash be
Probably want to get me to run, so they can blast me
Just, blast me in your box, play my shit
I know it's crowded at the top, cause I'm on the tip
And that's as high up at the top, as a brother could get
And how I do it make a lot of muh'fuckers upset
But it's fine, re-gizzlin' I'm back for mine
In case y'all gettin' tired of the same ol' shine
And I'm calm, calculated and perfectly aligned
The way I'm operatin' what is a surgery of rhyme
It's not a thang when I lower the gradient lens frames
I'm cooler than Clyde Stubblefield, drummer for James
Hip-Hop is out of Hustleville, comin' for change
I exercise 'til a muscle build, breakin' the chains
And I'm cool

  

Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart

Yo, I walk across this world that's deceptive
Beats are perfected, the ghetto's infested
With more destruction, my vocal eruption
Was speakin bout corruption with no introduction
Approach me with caution cause I spark losses
M-Illitant the rap arson, marchin
Leavin niggas stiff like I'm starchin, departin
Hollywood Sambos and jokes just like Martin
I'm the type of nigga that belong in a war
With a mic and a cord, to hold your head with a sword
Some proclaim lames, callin theyselves bold
They shall be flawed, when the claps applaud
If this a point of life, one I can't afford
Then I have to get sheist and I deal in fraud
Now back to the topic of the rap philosopher
With more drama than a soap opera
Who stops the propoganda, the hot block commander
Puttin a halt to all the backtalk and slander
Warn every challenger about the silencer
Muzzle in your mouth for the days that's on the calendar

Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart

I'm from the valley of the heavyheads, watch the ghetto pre-medical
Undergrads and steady red faces of stone
Eyes are crevices, life like a double negative
Philly criminal, I rhyme my dirt Tariq already did
Buildin this Fifth foundation in the wilderness
Thought-less, trespass and enter Thought's fortress
Limitless entrance, paid to the order of the
Cypher slaughterer, my mic slappin you senseless
Defenseless, niggas never movin me inches
The beat Fifth, invisi-ble in the trenches
Afficiando, awesome hip-hop drug problem
Fuck stardom, and chickens up in Gotham
Poltergeist, slit or choke the mic til it scream to me
Stop that, cash we conveniently got that
I stroll through your scenery cocked back
Me and Hot Mack, the nine-eight, El Dorado Cadillac Jacks

Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart
Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart

It's about flesh and blood
It's about a heart beat that beats strong
It's about s passion
That is unyielding
And I want you men to know today
It's your time
It is your hour
It is your moment
Go take it

Yeah speaking of pieces of a man
Staring at a future in the creases of my hand
It reads like a final letter I'm leaving for my fam' but
It's written in language they will never understand
A late repentant
Never deviating from a plan
I drive by headed for the valley of the damned
The wheels spin, I'm looking for a sacrificial lamb
Then roll tactics like a soldier out in the Sudan
Listen
Was this a matter of flesh and blood
Yes it was
Does it matter who win and lose
Yes it does
It ain't about the most blessed love
When you return to the essence
What is it back to the essence of
Greatness I wasn't in the presence of
Cause you was fake and never measured up
You just a nigga on his regular
But how far am I ahead of ya
It just as easily could'a been me instead of ya

We gone fight till we can't fight no more
You can't fight no more
You gone lie down and bleed a while
You gone get up
And fight some more
Want you say it with me
Repeat it after me when I say it
We gone fight

Fuck getting fucked
Immaculate conception
Now what's beef ain't even a question
Calico kisses, cold blood and crime tape
Flirt with death every night it's a blind date
One night stand paybacks a bitch
Shit have you skinny dipping in a pool of your piss
Blood sweat and tears broken teeth and spit
Put the barrel in your mouth
Blow the devil a kiss
Put the knife in ya back cut down to the red meat
Daddy should've let me be a stain on the bed sheets
I'm one shot short of a Molotov cocktail
Kick in the door like welcome to my world
I'm an evil genius when it comes to this dumb shit
Half of the time I'ma keep it one hundred
Don't play chicken when I'm driving them crazy
Get hit in the wing thigh breast or drumstick
We like

MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

The rhythm just sways and like a sorceress I slays
Foes and ri-vals, who wanna come
This way, they better pay attention
Or a penchant not to mention suspension
From the microphone plus the tension
Trey-eight-o's will vacate those
If there's drama with my henchmen
So lamp to my man Mussolini
Go get your whole staff, call the calf
Cause half-and-half's couldn't cream me
The lyrics make your head knock
Malik B and Black Thought, the dreadlock
Mannn, transss-gressin
You'll catch lead I, crushing
Poundin on the drums like King Kong
We can ring your bellll, ding-dong
I styles with my vocabulary
The Roots the one to call your ultra adversary
Now you're all desert cause I'mma serv ya like a tray
To meet your doom Malik's the boom so you get swept away

MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

Yo hello everybody do I need introduct
I be the mic mercenary very un..clear
To your ear the exquisite pattern that you hear
It's known to be Black Butta Baby
Crazy cardiac my attack on any fat rhythm
That I capture kid I snatch the mic from tykes
While I proceed and continue to tend to
Business, cause this is, how I do
I'm insane, and go against the grain like freight
Never on no nigga dick, cause I'm just too hip
Plus I rest where niggas pack and never act
Other than ill, shit is real in Phy-double
So if you want trouble let's stomp
My mission is to flip on comp
You might aspire to be flyer than I, you must pay
Your dues while I bruise niggas new for the day
Shall be swept away

MC's who slept for days, must be swept away

There's somethin goin on
Because there's somethin goin on
Yeah, somethin's goin on
Yeah, somethin goin on
Y'all know there's somethin goin
Because there's somethin goin on
She knows there's somethin goin on
Yeah, somethin goin on
Y'all know there's somethin goin on
Yeah, somethin's goin on
Because there's somethin goin on
Yeah, y'all know what's goin on

Uh yea, uh huh, yo

Check it out, you're now intuned to the sounds of the
R to the, double-O to the, T-S and I stretch limit to this profession
My voice physically fit, tracks I'm bench-pressing
The mic chord is an extension of my intestine
Delicate MC's sliced in my delicatessan
My mind state is that of the S-P
Connection, Pennsy a part of me, South Philly through my arteries
Thought the dark one, fearsome, slump son
My vocal just a knuckle that sucker punched the drum
Hip-hop yo that's my hustle and it kill a kingdom
That Fall Apart to drastic propor-tion
Lost ones out there, you better stand clear
The Fifth Dynasty, it be a world premier
Cuttin' through like attorneys at law that's car chasin'
You star gazing, the force y'all facin' is the
R-to the, double-O to the, T-S an'
Y'all niggaz in the mix, keep guessin'
The world traveler in the flesh without question
Last seven years on tour without restin'
Yo the kind of rapper you should reconsider testin'
Supreme simply, o-fficial Dundee
What I bring'll motivate to move your whole country
Throw your hands up if y'all want me to proceed wit
And carry out strategic plans to leave wit
The title that I'm watchin, Roots we run-ting
My Dundee atire for MC hunting
Step up and out the ring
Y'all niggaz on some other, y'all loud as Don King
But wine drink within the danger zone lounging
You need to be more aware of your surroundings
Reality at times is astounding enough to get your heart pounding
It's safe to assume, in all confidence
That I'm one of the illest in the seven continents
Yo, you on my dick, thanks for the compliments
You be fucked up by my Table of Contents *begins fading*

Yo yo, it's the R to the, double-O to the, T-S an' yo
When I strike to excite, I just aim, I never miss
Embrace you wit a hug of death, give your ass a slight kiss
Toxic words that spill over pages, for ages
Impacts like M-16's to twelve gauges
The rage is still in me, never act too friendly
Scully down creepin' while you tilted off Henny
Many man begin pure but in this world of sin your
Holdin' tight my mor-al by in-jure
We scramble, because this game life is the gamble
Vandalize your terrain, go against the grain
Invade your brain wit the collision causing division
Sweep your sector, leavin' you niggaz for stool-pigeons
Sweep your sector, leavin' you niggaz for stool-pigeons
Sweep your sector, leavin' you niggaz for stool-pigeons
My religion is a way of life, but the trife replays
Cuz niggaz actin' shiest these days
Wagin' wars, usin' dynamics cuz I'ma slam it
You talkin' all this out out your mouth, you satanic
Roam the planet, always takin' bullshit for granted
Just a cool type of cat but you still can't understand it
You told to sit back, stand still and chill
Niggaz bound to clap shots cuz they all act ill
Wit a sour-ass taste smilin' up in your face
I'm like trust, never leavin' no trial or no trace
Disappear wit the wind, ? shows the discipline
Twenty-five years of my life I learned to miss amend
Peep the structure of a whole empire
Smuggled sealed tai, pack lyrics like Kya
Verbal messiah, when I cross I set a fire
Wacker MC went in doubt cuz I'm for hire

Hit the flo' ah, cuz it's bout to blow ah
C'mon, hit the flo' ah, it's bout to blow ah
Hit the flo' ah, it's about to blow ah
Hit the flo' ah, cuz it's about to blow ah
Lyrical landslide, bonafide worldwide live
Shit to make my niggas in the west just vibe
Comin out the numero that don't divide
That's 5, talk hustle that's the way we survive
My alter-ego, Five-Hundred Fifty-Five people collide
Beneath a ?counter-locks? last like a thousand shots

Stand up, stretch for the stars
Get somebody else involved right next to ya
Y'all elected me to keep it so fresh for ya
Just cause I make it possible for the rest of ya
To just take it there come on and
Get your head ringin' from the sting of the snare
Spine tingle elevating every singular hair
All the way from South Philly on a wing and prayer
And still bringin' it yeah

C'mon take it there, let's take it there

I'm from the side of town
Where shots get sprayed around
Where the expectancy rate be twenty-eight around
Downtown battleground where cops parade around
Have your whole view of life beyond jaded
How everybody sick of breaking down, tryin' a make it out
Hand over fist the only way to get the paper down
People tired of gettin' pushed around, gettin' gangsta now
Discipline the only way to bring some kinda change around
Chain cirgarette smokin' with bad nerves
And brothas with bad lungs from smokin' mad herb
Whoever in the dark is unseen and heard
Let's submerge, I can feel something close we on the verge
Talkin' bout, to my street sweepers, hotel housekeepers
And my people spillin' this out through jail house speakers
Some people rather use than might than use heaters
Some people rather lose they life than lose freedom
For real

C'mon take it there, let's take it there

Flash light, red light, proceed ahead right
Straight into them headlights, you get your head right
Head right get a third strike, hit the turnpike
Life quicker than spliff that wouldn't burn right
Make you wanna holla 'bout it
It ain't no doubt about it
Every now and then you gotta stand up and shout about it
And I'll be shoutin' it to, as if a shout'll count
Yo they got accountin' to do, reamount the balance
The shit more puzzlin' than a jigsaw
Raw pitbulls hustlin' through the pitfalls
Some of y'all toys let the laughter rip roar
Heart felt truth in every lyric I spit forth
Raise up time to lift off
Written on a legal pad, poetry that sizzle the clip board
My og, my homey who taught me deal
Said in prayer that's the only time you should ever kneel
And that's real, I'm a take it there

C'mon take it there, let's take it there

Come on, ha, you want it want it

Straight runnin' y'all winnin' come down to the combat dog I'm a workaholic 
My smack touches every enemy within my clutches 
Black bringin' that ruckus 
And I'm puttin' that lean on all you suckas

Yer tone hushes from bunches

My sound entrenches each of the five 
Senses and hold in shock

Fences you mortify, pressurize, best defy 
We slide into the next dimension time to exorcise, recognize 
Your spine tingle, darts mingle, while this line sting you 
It's tricks on yo state of mind, somebody's watching you 
Just look alert-alive 
'Cause only one survive 
No use of lyin' to yourself, you standing eye-to-eye 

Come on, you want it want it

Yo,
I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed it to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - to read the gender how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Comps are dated - I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

Driftin 

Driftin ------- 

I would begin to dial -
Her number but knowin it's been awhile it's hard to link
I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
Fightin the feelin I'm concealin apparently I first appealin
Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mic's and puffin reefa
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said "Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana"?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
But if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental I never forgot it
Yo the psycotic, the hypnotic check it out the Most Melodic hypnotic

Driftin 
Driftin

Fuck, kill, and prosper 
Is the gospel of Wonderland, where 
Street sands, are quick
To suck you down to the abyss 
With the lure of pure bliss if you kiss the dicks 
Of the niggaz? Never, Nosferatu's 
Those witches and warlocks in blue 
Government gumshoe, keepers of the first zoo 
Who? Me?  
I'm the modern day vixen vampire slayer 
Unauthorized player, in the capitalist contest 
To see who "Gets Money" 
No milk and honey, in this land 
Cause justice has been banned 
So it's play dirty or die by the hand 
That's holding all the guns 
Plunged, deep into religion was my first decision 
To save me and my daughter's lives, but 
I can't thrive off spirit and scripture 
The picture grew clearer; I made the move to rear her 
In a life wanting for nothing 
So I got into this drug thing 
Not doing, but dealing 
Sealing fates and, healing struggle gaped, wounds 
Of the doomed became my mission 
Izm was just too small time 
I had to find the best design to 
Fuck with the massive motherfuckers minds, and pockets 
So I sold ? kits and, alleyway thigh splits for two bits 
And, five year old preschool pussy 
And, once strong now bony backs and stretched out 
Weary racks of snatch, in other words
I sold crack 
Morality was buried deep, beneath the new Jeep, 
Silk sheets and money heaps 
Still the good mother, I sent my daughter off to 
Boarding school to keep shit under cover 
All the while envisioning myself, a champion of ghetto causes 
Plus his, game I was playing, and winning 
While sinning, against myself and soul to get the gold 
I was the Female Don, the Crack Queen 
To me I seemed unstoppable, my coffers full 
I went buckwild, wanting more 
Like the pipe worn whores I began to deplore 
No time for playing with my coochie 
Counting my man's mad lucci 
While he was up inside some hoochie's loose piece 
I signed the checks and, I counted out the cash 
Wasn't saving ass for no niggaz sent upriver 
I thought my shit was tight
Til my empire started to quiver 
Taking every chance, under surveillance, being listened to 
And watched, like Assata Shakur 
My place on the top was no more sure 
Loose lips flipped the script 
The fantasy trip, swiftly ended 
It took no time to blend in, with the population prison 
My jaded vision, busted like a cherry 
Every, dream I had, now tainted bad 
I fucked and, I killed, to prosper 
Upheld each tenant, of the ghastly gospel 
Shift to a different Wonderland to pay the price for my vice 
A land of fields to toil in like slaves 
No lilies in this field just plenty of souls to save 
Plenty of fat uniformed rats with 
Below average size cocks that slither 
Through cell locks, in the night 
Lactating tits being licked, left and right 
Plenty of coochie, burning with desire 
Like black churches in the South 
Black prayers and pussy on fire 
Penned up behind barbed wire 
Me and my fellow female mammals, animals 
Bitches in cages, bodies racked with hormone rages 
Minds haunted by our children's faces 
They mace us, with promises of rehabilitation slash corruption 
Place smoking guns in empty hands of, native sisters and sons 
I joined in this nation's favorite pastime 
On a quest to gets mine 
Now I'm passing time standing on line 
In the commissary to buy Maxi-Pads 
Instead of shopping at Barney's for Chanel bags 
Nana who raised me, went to bed a-dazed 
Via my mistakes, and my daughter hates 
Me for what I did 
And I'm fucked, and I'm stuck 
Doing the Devil's bid 
Being locked in a moral corrupt crib 
Psst, missing my kid, psst, hey girl, 
You want to get finger fucked tonight? 
I swear I'll stick it in and up tight just right 

Yo sis, I've had to kill and shit 
Just blow my head pretty and I'll give you a slip 
Alright Ladies, lights out!

Yo I'm tha anti-circle
On tha mad train like a rain
Thats verbal I storm
Never comin twice in one form
Tha black'll act a fool and I'm gone
Crumbs bust it pass tha popcorn
As I kick flava behavior your absctract I get recognition
But I represent no religon or sect 
So I'm no preacher but I reach your soul 
Cause I'm stronger than younger
Son of Casandra like ganga I grow
From tha root like water I flow
Could sport ebrotha low or tha nappy afro
I still a have tha pick cause I choose to evict
Derelicts on tha tip tryin to diss tha mad skit busta skit 
How many licks to it take to make a fake
Realize that he can't shake bake or penetrate
This style I demonstrate on a regular
Basis in face that he aint no competitor
I said it a second ago yo I'm tha anti-circle with tha mad style
Crushin any mental that be fragile
You don't wanna see me get like agile
Rippin up tha scene screamin like I was a bad child
Black Thought so hip that I'm square
Tha rhythm that you hear is from tha kids right over there
Tha rubberband in question just one step away
Yesterday was a day away attention you should pay today
To tha Roots stickin boot kickin with flippa
I lift tha party up and y'all get down like a zipper
Tha mista hippa flippa kid tha one who thinks tha music can be hurtin a
Rhythm when I get anti-circular

Chorus:

Square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square y'all
From tha square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square

What you spot up with ya peepers is tha creeper
Stompin on tha ground smokin a quarter pound reefer
Mista five finger lead singer noise maker
Number one run I'm rush now you must hush
I crush trail mix with tha sandal
Five fingers keep a candlestick lit when I vandalize
Can't see what I is or will be 
Only what I was cause I crush an MC
I'm dandy happy go lucky don't touch me
Don't play cause I'm not tha right one baby
Crazy off key never talk softly 
Blacker than tha beans still I never sweat coffee
Tha fourth beat following tha third word second after first
Yo never rehearse tha verse that I'm freestylin'
Cause my verse is diverse I'm Mista Versatilin'
Things are easier with oooh chilin'
Ya smilin because you dig tha way that I deliver
And give a style flowin like I was tha Nile river you shiver
Cause I'm cooler than tha coolest act a fool its like a habit
So yo this trick is for tha rabbit
I grab it and snatch it inspect it like gadget
I works tha magic tha mic I must have it
I'm at it kids does tha pin on tha vibe tribe
Members do decide to send around at tha sit down
Get down can't you know I'm quick to rip a kid down
Aim to put wack rappers in containers with tha lid down
So I seal it can you feel it many contacts is caught
On a mad train a Black Thought

Chorus:

Square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square y'all
From tha square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square
From tha square to tha circle to tha square

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Yeah, it's like everyday I wake up
I stare into space and don't say much
Peer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up
Coffee pots, cigarettes, morning Js, Baileys
Slowing down my day before it picks up the pace
Beats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs
Feeling exhausted from times we toured constant
And plus the toxins I sip got me tall
Still tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles
Every day is like a blank canvas
Carving my initials in the planet like I brand it
Hand picked to live this life we take for granted
Like a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it
Smiling through the trouble we face, trying to manage
My way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant
Cause I can sit on my ass or just imagine
The madness I did on my path and paint the canvas

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Before I rise and shine like a neon sign
I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein
And burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton
It's my only bonafide break from these confines
I need a change of scenery like a montage
These kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad
And everybody coming at me from the blindside
I'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide
I listen to some theme music on the iPod
And walk around the crib doing little odd jobs
Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise
Feeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline
I got to try different things in these trying times
Twenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five
It's come alive time, I picked a fine time
For getting open off life like a fine wine

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Sunday morning, plan my day out
Whole new blueprint, brand new layout
Deep down still don't know if it'll play out
But for the first time feel like I done found a way out
Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight
Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith
Troubles of the world had me in a cross-face
Chicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base
But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase
And I finally understand my right to choose
My preacher man told me it could always be worse
Even the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose
So you can stop and refresh the rules
Breathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds
Something inside said that's the move
And made it today, I'll restart fresh and new

When I wake up, I look into the mirror
I can see a clearer, vision
I should start living today
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day
Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Oh, the fire, the fire
Oh, the fire, the fire

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn
You don't say good luck
You say don't give up
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn

Yeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads
And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code
My soul starts to grow colder than the North Pole
I try to focus on the whole of where the torch goes
In the tradition of these legendary sports pros
As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a life time
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or canceling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with
Something in my eyes says I'm so close to having the prize
I realize I'm supposed to reach for the skies
Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn
You don't say good luck
You say don't give up
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn

One love, one game, one desire
One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher
I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
'Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
It's David and Goliath; I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time starts to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush; it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart--I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not be a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate
I hate losing; I refuse to make the same mistake

Oh, the fire, the fire
Oh, there's something in your heart

There's something in your heart

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn
You don't say good luck
You say don't give up
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn

Oh, the fire
Inside you
The fire
Inside you
The fire
Inside you

Shanky Don Intro:
Now this one is dedicated to the good the bad and the desolated. And The
Roots crew you know them lyrically orientated program you lose in life
instantly ? we're like acid we burn you. Watch a rude bwoy now. 

Black Thought:
Yo you should see some of these cats that vocalize
They get props from they local guys and try to raise 
Speaching through the mic like "Yo I apologize"
They blind and wasn't as wise and fail to realize the com-
Plectual sexual side of the rhyme
When I make love to the mic the crowd respond
Your promoter love the vocal over dub when I control the club 
So throw your hands up in the air show your love
We waste not the bangingest beats but make use
The Roots get you open like parachutes
Yo who in the house only deal with hip hop that's authentic?
Back to renovate your state of mind for a minute
It's I, Bad Lieutenant represent fine lye
Delphia empire fifth dynasty
Your third eye couldn't wait for you to relate to what I activate
While the fake spectate 
I'm less then immpressive for beyond stressin'
And battle as a reveloutionary adolescent 
But now in the present with fake masters of ceremonies yo that's phoney
You'll get capped with colonial force that of a cannon
Examinin the compact disc to start rammin'
To put the diagram in effect and get fly
On immature MC's who try 
Wake 'em up outta they High School High

Shakny Don:
Yo bumbading bumdadabedang
The Roots crew boy we mash things again
Bumbading ripapadededang The Roots crew bwoy we runnin' back again
Bumbading dumdadadedang The Roots boy dem run the island
Bumbading ripadededang look ? I mash up the scene

Malik B :
I blast off the roof to prove she lay in there blazed
Enslaved by the soundwaves as the skills amaze
Insight skin type annalitic cause I live it 
My ? brow pivot over your style like "give it"
The lyricism I'm contemplatinng your neighborhood or legion
Brutalize your section stalk your whole region
When you blink it's hell then you drink Sifendale
You wonder what's goin' inside of my thinkin' cells
We bomb like militias I'm trying to stack riches
Look first comes the money the power then the 

They all will bring you down but I Milliant the sound 
With a bargaid of pirate raps that's running through your town 
Surrounded by a wise dome my ledge knows horizons
I keep at a distance confused and feel cyclones
You know I'm trying to make it because I probably take it
Hustlin' stickin' pickin' it or scrape it
Tracks appeal that's why I'm trying to mack a mil
I stay sedated worth a Zantac that's a pill
It gets hectic that's why niggas try to exit
Stress relates to those who walk around protected

Shanky Don:
Yo bumbading ripadingdedingdedang 
The Roots crew man dem mash up the scene
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man is running back again
Bumbading ripadingdedingdedang
The Roots crew man them come back again
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man they run the islang

Dice Raw:
Naw nigga what's up then? Thanks for the man outroduction
Go ask your girl inside my world is the duction
No frontin' finger on the button of destruction
Play nice like entice and keep your styles on the hush and
Step inside the illafifth dungeon
Where it smells of pungent 
The underwater the brotherly lovin' 
Where crabs get knocked out respect from 
Brought back to the lab were the scientist will dissect 'em
The old heads sniffin' start bitchin' when we testin'
Interupting my class when my class is in session
Was when I manifestin' or come to teach a lesson 
What's inside of my dome I'll have all you clones guessin'
Lets begin as the color gets tossed in with the pen
It feels good that's when you know it's a sin
Everytime I rhyme I might get charged for murder
Slicing your back with rap turn a brain into burger
Lyrically I shot with radioactive waves 
Like Kolby and Big Kev on fridays
Your styles older than dolo we on the top of  
Claim to gettin' over but you ain't makin' quota

Shanky Don:
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man they mash up the lane
Bumbading bumdadadedang this a poor rap boy you might not see again
Bumbading bumdadadedang The Roots crew man they run things again
Bumbading bumdadadedang Rufugee Camp step on thee scene
Bumdading bumdadadedang

Yo, I knew this girl named Alana with mad persona
She delt with reality never fed in to the drama
I met her through my nigga named Jermaine Palmer
Who knew her through his peoples by the Baltimore harbor
Alana was a Marylan' thurough and attractive
Shorty that's relaxed with me and kickin back
Wif a phat flick to cool out
Was stressed cause the game'll make you wanna pull a tool out
And go the old school route
But all-a that cease - when that piece checkin the jewel out
A bruver was charged - light a spliff and listen to the dabarge
Let the shorty hit me wif a massage to annoint
Lubricatin my maridian points that was the Summer easy to remember
Alana was all up on - Tariq Agenda how I used to back bender
She even told her best friend Blinda from Virginia
Who asked me if I had a cousin I could recomend-a
But as time float on we grew more mature - and further apart
When I began to do tours, we lost contact
And slowly parted - reminissin of when it started
It keep me feelin heavy hearted - a stolen moment periodic
Addicted to her presence like a narcotic
Though I wonder if she ever got it - the hypnotic
That faded like a dream sequence that pursuaded
Beyond being infatuated - spiritually intoxicated
Calm, sedated- I concentrated
On how to get in touch with her
Cuase the fact of the matter remain that I miss the hypnotic

Driftin 

I would begin to dial
Her number but knowin it's been awhile it's hard to link
I figure what she probly think and soon start to drink
Fightin the feelin I'm concealin apparently I first appealin
Later revealin to be deeper - resistance increasingly weaker
The essence of life is more than just mic's and puffin reefa
This universe of Black Thought that I can teach ya
I'm tryin to touch ya only if I can reach ya
I hit this kid I sign up on his beepa
And ask him if a had a chance to speak ta
Jermaine Palmer who fathers a preacha
To make the story short me and my man soon ran
Into each other von the humble at a show in San Fran
I said "Yo Palma, when did you last see Alana"?
He offer me a seat and attempts to make me calma
When he began to break it down my mind start to wander
Response beyond somber incredible crushed
Kinda feelin on my shoulder - that of a boulder
To find out that her life was over - it made the room feel colder
I thought I could get wif her when she was a little older
But she a victim of the wicked system that controlled-a it's all chaotic
But if my life it's symbolic forever shadow on my mental I never forgot it
Yo the psycotic, the hypnotic check it out the Most Melodic hypnotic

Driftin' 

Lyrically versatile
My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grased in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbred for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin' through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin' over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jasz shit I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin' up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin' Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetratin is void

Ya leave niggas missin' in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
 I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice
Nigga de Raw, never take a bad fall
Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin' handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin' on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin' a train honey dip and I'ma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin'
If you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?
Cause he know the time like I know the time
When I grab the microphone
It's like, summertime, laid back, to recline
In my La-Z-Boy chair
Dice Raw, the Wild Noid
I'm the fuck up outta here

Yeah, you go
Hey you listeners, stop what you're doin' and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
You listeners, stop what you're doin' and

Yo, one, two, one-two one-two
That's how we usually start, once again it's the Thought
The Dalai Lama of the mic, the prime minister Thought
This directed to whoever in listening range
Yo the whole state of things in the world bout to change
Black rain fallin' from the sky look strange
The ghetto is red hot, we steppin' on flames
Yo, it's inflation on the price for fame
And it was all the same, but then the antidote came
The Black Thought, ill syllablist, out the Fifth
This heavyweight rap shit I'm about to lift
LIKE, a phyllum lift up it's seed to sunlight
I plug in the mic, draw like a gunfight
I never use a cordless, or stand applaudless
Sippin' cholorophyll out of ill silver goblets
I'm like a faucet, monopoly's the object
There ain't no way to cut this tap, you got ta get wet
Your head is throbbin' and I ain't said shit yet
The Roots crew, the next movement, c'mon!

And yes y'all
You are now in tune to the sounds

The hot hot music, the hot music

Word up, the formation of words to fit
That's what I usually disturb you with
A lot of rappers never heard of this, or know half the time it is
You doubt the Illa-Fifth, what could you accomplish?
Whether they skywriting your name, or you anonymous
You be speechless, with stinging sinuses
The Roots royal highnesses through your monitors
I tilt my crown, then blow down a diamond kiss
You need to buy a CD and stop rewindin' this
I'm the finalist, shinin' like a rugged amethyst
And at your music conference, I'm the panelist
Listen close to my poetry, I examine this
Like an analyst, to see if you can handle this
Check it out
You, got the groove, emcees
Freeze, stand still, nobody move
Unless you dealin' with The Next Movement
The P-Phi-D we be the mon-u-ment
I live my life nice, but I'm not too bent
You theatrical as a Broadway play, this ain't Rent
One hundred percent, straight out the Basement
Spreading this across a planet on some next shit
How many people feelin this love music? C'mon

Yo, you go

Yo, we obviously need to tone it down a bit
Running round town spending time like it's counterfeit
Everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena let me show y'all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing something positive
Humble head down low and broke like promises
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
But when that paper got low so did my tolerance
And it ain't no truth in a dare without the consequence
Listen if it not for these hood inventions
I'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay serving a life sentence
Even if I'm going to hell I'm gonna make an entrance
Yeah let em know I'm getting cheese like omelets is
But I'm the toast of the town like Thomas'

We're all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don't worry bout what you ain't got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side
Make it to the other side
That's when we'll settle up the score

Yo, we did this in remembrance of
Faces from the past we no longer have an image of
Carrying cold blood hearts that never been for love
Brothers keep going for theirs but never get enough
World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return to learn the world wasn't big enough
Damn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up
Now all I know is I'm about to wake this nigga up
Yeah that hindsight, 20/20, now niggas dead on the money
Trying to take something from me it's a wrap like a mummy
Undun I am becoming and when he's tired of running
Through the layers of the onion
He'll probably shed a tear cause they'll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
Life is only a moment in time and it passed by

We're all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don't worry bout what you ain't got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side
Make it to the other side
That's when we'll settle up the score

I'm sitting on top of the world ready to jump off
Thinking of various ways to breaking the law
Thinking that enough is enough but still I want more
Thinking of how I'm playing with fire that burned my young boy
By any means necessary, don't give a damn
So every night I'm on a flight that never lands
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
Can't win, can't lose
Get 'em gassed, leave 'em leaking fuel
Either way the market moves
Cash rules kings, queens, prince and princess
Every night I'm crossing a line that ain't the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness
Too far gone to come back to my senses
Now I'm on the edge of my bed making love to my meds
Every moment's like a pistol to my head
When I'm getting mine

We're all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don't worry bout what you ain't got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side
Make it to the other side
That's when we'll settle up the score

Muffled sound of fist on flesh 
Blows to chest 
No breath 
Air gasps 
You ain't nothing but white trash, bitch! 
With each hit, each kick, each, broken rib 
Crack, crack! 
Bones are crying 
Mommy's crying and bleeding 
And pleading 
And then 
Daddy wants to fuck 
Dick hard, swelled with power rush 
And as if all that wasn't enough 
Mommy's seven months heavy with birth 
As, Daddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied ear 

First, lullaby 
First, son, will, ever, hear 
And never forget 

Mommy almost bled to death when she have him, finally 
She'd already lost, three 
Uterus-bruised, shredded, and weak 
From being daily beat 
And Friday nights were the worse and 
Daddy never came with flowers 
Instead he spent hours at some corner spot 
With some bar pop named Cookie 
Putting his thing down 
Soiling Mommy's sheets with
Sweet, talk shit, 
Cookie's cheap lipstick, 
Hair grease, sperm, and Jezebel juice 

To hell with the good news that
He was a father for the first time 
His thirst for wine and women 
Clouded his vision 
No warm welcome for mother and son 
Just 
The rank smell of ass-crack, funk, and cum 
But Mommy's prayerful strength-her best defense 
She, burned the dirty linens 
Made a fresh bed 
Laid sleeping First Son down 
And never made a sound 
As she purged her scourge 
With birth-blood and quiet tears 
Watching as her fears and love and sacrifice 
Lie there in his soft skin and new life 
Breathing, dreaming, fresh from God's eye 
Mommy's little survivor 
Like, her 

Mommy called crazy and scorned 
Cause she two more born 
One boy soon after 
The girl much later and 
Although they were both sung the same lullabies of hate 
Her, First Son, the first one 
Whose, womb-world was profaned 
Came of age playing street games 
With Stewie, Rezzie, and Little Brother 
'Till his heart start to wither 
In pain and shame 
Blamed Mom for the wrong she let Daddy do to her 
And him
Let, sins of the Father cause his innocence to wander 
Found out amongst thieves 
Chose to squander his dreams 
Stopped believing in himself 
Become prodigal with his life 
Make impossible shit right with
Gang-ties, crime, lies 
Erase wise, woeful words of Mother 
Replaced them with absurdities of others 
Who had also lost their way 

Played a different kind of street game now 
First Son plunged deep 
Speak street-family vows 
Espouse no causes but his own 
See, he couldn't protect Mommy's neck from Daddy's grasp 
Or, protect Mommy's ass from Daddy's wrath 
Couldn't shield her ears from
Daddy's foul-mouthed, liquor-breath jeers 
His only defense-served be confidence 
Brown bottles housed his swift descent 
Phones called cops on block frequent for his shenanigans 
Now, Daddy and him twins in addiction 
Driven to false-hearted heavens and friends 
By liquefied demons 
Had become what he despised from conception 'til end 
Destined for a demise 
Survived nine lives of staying high 
Conning, jewelry-pawning, arrests, theft 
Womanizing, only for money, never for sex 
Bullet in chest, baseball bat to the head 
Left for dead 
So, eyes wide and glassy 
Speech, slowed and slurred 
Lips twitched with caked-up codeine candy 
And mouth corners one December 24th 
Mr. Hide and False Friend 
Took final ride to suburban supplier 
Shots were fired by the gray man 
With shaky hand 
But not shaky enough to miss
Hit, Lost Boy in back 
So-called Friend runs for door 
Leaves First Son blood-born 
Lying alone in blood on cold floor 

Death was the cause of
Returning to Innocence Lost

Baby 'Sis awake for dawn on Christmas morn 
To Mommy's sobs and shakes 
Daddy's silhouettes of regret 
All past, omitted, and absolved by lost 
As they clung to each other 
Knowing

The Roots is comin' 

I rip the vocal backflip yo the kid is a bad bro
I can drip it hipper than dip into calyp-so
A-dios, amigo, which means I gots ta G-O
Makes you wonder bout my number
Guess my address or my P.O., here's a hint:
I'm from Phila with a Del but not the Rio
Well, I'm guessing here is like exactly where the Phi go
Now, we got the Phila-Del-Phi why not top it off with an A?
The Philadelphiadic rhythmatic way I'm straight from Philly

Silly but rugged then a hill-billy
Just like I said before I sport my skully when it's chilly
My cap is from The Lay Up, my bows from The Gilly
The Roots, is out to blow up like a clip from out the milli
or the oo-wop, I do drop, gizzantic, the crew wop
From out the darkest field I goes to pick the funk crop
You can't deny the props so stop before your fronts
get loosened, introducing, The Roots y'all..

Knocked up nine months ago
And what she's fittin' to have she don't know
She wants neo soul cause hip hop is old
She don't want no rock'n roll
She want platinum, ice and gold
She want a whole lot of somethin' to fold
If you're an obstacle she'll just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
Little Mary's bad
In these streets she done ran
Ever since when the heat began
I told the girl look here
Calm down I'm gonna hold your hand
To enable you to keep the plan
Because you're quick to learn
And we can make money to burn
If you allow me the latest game
I don't ask for much but enough to room to spread my wings
And a world fittin' to know my name, just listen to me

I don't ask, for much these days
And I don't bitch and whine if I don't get my way
I only want to fertilize another behind my lover's back
I sit and watch it grow standin' where I'm at
Fertilize another behind my lovers behind my lovers back
And I'm keeping my secrets mine
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary dropped my baby girl tonight I would name her rock 'n roll

Cadillac needs space to roam
Where we headin' for she don't know
We in the city where the pro shake rattle 'n roll
And I'm a god dang rollin' stone
I don't beg I can hold my own
I don't break I can hold a chrome
And it's weighin' a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is the only one
And Black Thought is bad
These streets he done ran ever since when the game began
I never played the fool
Matter of fact I've been keeping it cool
Since money been changin' hands
And I'm left to shine, the legacy I leave behind be the seed that'll keep the flame
I don't ask for much but enough room to spread these wings
And a world fittin' to know my name, now listen to me

I don't beg from a rich man
And I don't scream and kick when his shit don't fall in my handsman
Cause I know how to still
Fertilize another against my lovers will
I lick the opposition cause she don't take no pill
Oh you know the deal you'll be keeping my legend alive
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight I would name her rock 'n roll

Oh break it down, down for me
I push my seed somewhere deep in her chest
I push it naked cause I've takin' my test
Deliverin' Mary it don't matter the sex
I'm gonna name it rock 'n roll

I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushin' it right
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her rock 'n roll
I would name her rock 'n roll
I would name her rock 'n roll
I would name it rock 'n roll

From the Tunnels in the wee hours of the black morning
From The Roots sprout the Foreign Objects family tree
This is mad abstract
All the way live from Philly, we got the hip-hop coalition
called the Foreign Objects in effect
It's like dat, now dig

 Mr. Trotter, a.k.a.

Well um, Black Thought from The Roots y'all

 Mr. Simmons, a.k.a.

A.J. Shine, The Dollar Sign, funky bid'ness

And we the Foreign Objects 
And it's like this..

Now get loose, get loose, Malik B get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun  have fun 
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Yes, I will address and press about my microphone
me-ssiah, am the best siah? Yes-I am
most quick to go because I'm equipped to flow a script
I will just slay and disobey, I will display banana clips
that slaughter with the words and the herds of the verbs
I gots the urge to splurge, like a Bosnian Serb
A-drift I means a-draft I means I riff I means I raff
Rap's ca-tas-trophe, don't want no brass tro-phy
So okey-dokey folks, most provoke me ? so hold your ?
was willin, cause I'm strollin with the quotes
Like Shakespeare, Mark Twain, or Edgar Allan Poe
But since I'm a ne-gro, I flows like Maya Ange-lou
No banja-lo was played, I means banjo betrayed
so the guitar, had to take the bitch off, and slay
You might think I'm a rookie or an amateur, but put me
on a panel or a channel I'll dismantle like the vandal-er
I meants to say the scandalous, vandalous, handle this
like my man Emilio, what y'all should really know
You couldn't get the picture, if you was in an orchard
or fortress, 

Now get loose, get loose, ? get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun  have fun 
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Picture this as I get rugged with the scrpiture
Evacuatin scenes, spreadin thoughts like a drifter
I exit through my state of greater elevation, unifying
grains through the force of the imagination, you dig
what I'm saying? But I see your mind's playing tricks
You thought you got the channel but you couldn't get a fix
upon my mental -- I keep it complicated
Explosion of the spirit cause I opened up my soul and created
So now you dig the flavor, you're tasting what I gave ya
Seeping through the cellar cause I be the freak of nature
With, the images that I hold in my head
I be the kid from the Fifth, so y'all holding what I've said
I've said, I be the omnipresent factor from the void
Fatter is the flow, so my styling is employed
I'm ragged, pants worn bagged, and umm
the ghetto be my home so I shouts to the slum
Come, the misfit's got a tale, take you on a mad trip
The thoughts unveil
I'm too deep, you sinks down, I creeps round, the lowest
of the levels, the positive raps that kill devils
The abstracts, right and exact, knapsack's on the back
Rip poetical flows upon the track
My thoughts escape onto a tape, you'll play it back
and listen, I brought to your mind what's missing

Now get loose, get loose, Pazi Plant get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun  have fun 
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

I'm hip to release ill units, I displays major soul
The ? out, so soul stays rhythmatic
to the static when it plays, levels from the bass
They chase but they'll never catch my patt-er-ns
Soul surrounds this Plant like the rings upon Sa-tur-n
Yo, I'm fatter than many, came to kick away any job
Umm, cat, conniver if it's abstract I'm liable
take portion cause I'll fly that head ?
Dig the jazz that's closets from the Paz be-low bugged
Groovy like the nickel bag of love, slidin
through the groovy fuzz, Plants is the buzz
Mad abornmal, is my flow, much confusion, enhanced in
My scenario's too advanced'n, for duplication
If it's violation, soul power, will shower ya
defenses now you're falling, and crawling
Cause your styles are infantile not poetically correct
to test I'm laughin at ya, lyrical stature, cause my status
be that is the coolest kid to do a bid on fakers
with the grammar that be blamma, back in eighty-three
I was the Grand Fruit Jammer, but now I gets down
and wreck shit with the Foreign Objects..
Yeah that's right, the Foreign Objects

Ahhh yeah, now two check, two check
Now check it out, now check it out
Get loose, get loose, Myself ? ? ? get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun  have fun 
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Kinda like, ? catch, of the day is mad wreck
I raise heck, no raise hell, you plays back, your tape's ill
Show me just exactly what it is you want, I give you what we got
We got flow, we got soul, we get off, a lot
So lock up, your doors, cause I'm
Busting Loose like Richard Pryor, setting stuff on fire
We got funky, rhymes
Stuff you had swinging, like a monkey, I'm
always hanging 'round, living off of Vine
as in West Philly, 56th Street
The kids be getting jay'd on the corner
Swing my hat to the back, Kangol, no maybe 5 Soul
Not no bootleg treat, you get from 52nd Street, word up
Word to life, word is bond, word to God
I'm like the bean he's like a bean
I guess the stage is like a pod, ain't with
no metamorphosistically I kiss a licorice
and any miss I wish to kiss or else I diss like this
So I step to the left, drop the mic, catch my breath
then, watch the Foreign Object catch wreck, uhh

Get loose, get loose, Shorty get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun  have fun 
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Can I kicks it?
I kicks it for the others so I kick it for you
I gotta nag a dog and note to Billy - I gets down
Sound's got a lot I got my own I'm throwin passes
Asses are grabbed, when I swing with The Roots
Suits, I got none, but throwin off that accoutrements
ever since I winced at the thought of a dress
Yes you might be wantin to consider me a tomboy
Boy get it right, I'm still strictly lovin men
Send me your love, don't ever think I don't need it
Shit I got problems, can you help me out?
Shout a little louder if you're sure that you hear me
Fear me not, I'm just another average girl
Curls in my head, and yeah I think I look good

Should I be the one, to break the bad news?
Snooze when I'm tired, not when I'm hype, your type
Yo I just came off!

Get loose, get loose, Manifest get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun  have fun 
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Introducing lyrics for the year of ninety-three
The black brainchild is about to kick the groovy
speak out the head, provided for the hardrocks
Here to resurrect the ghetto beats for the blocks
You can dig the styles cause the styles are for the digging
A fat sack of soul, that's how the Sector roll
Never making fake material, why should I?
The mind is so equipped to rip, so why would I
give you less than that, you in fact, this is where it's at
cause lyrics I've provided is about to swing the bat
and shake up the levels from New York to Montego
It's all about the lyrics, it's not about the ego
Quick to make a jam and slam sound like the pro that I am
It's profound, like the kids from the underground
Every single lyric is prepared, in the hunt for the metro
with scoops of fat loops and funky lingo
Level's being felt, all over in the fifty states
Breaking more beats than my moms breaks the china plates
Transmitting, hitting areas we freak with funk
when we come to planet Earth, with a trunk of fat, soul
Alert doing work on the everyday
Here to bring the swing like my man Donny Hathaway
Just, follow the dotted line, and do what we do
Because you gotta get a grip, if you want your shit

Now get loose, get loose, Lord Akil get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun  have fun 
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Umm, from the Southern side of Philly yet of The Roots
there comes me, who?
The janky little brother of Mr. Bruce
A jazz kickin kid who flows, like the river Jordan
Not fond of Honda scooters, but I'll take an Accord and
zoom right through your borough, because I'm crazy thorough
No offspring running 'round but no my penile is not sterile
Collects the crazy papes from, selling crazy tapes, umm
Big heads be gettin swollen, I crush em just like grapes
The level that I'm zoning, the one that's on the third
Eatin buds or mad grass that gets you HIGHER than a bird
Kinks, be in the head, cause I leave the curls to Jheri
Got mad souls out the ass with shit, fat like William Perry
A poor black kid with rhythm, a eye for jazzy beats
Straight from the underground, found new life on the South Streets
We ? off the jams that will uplift the people's souls
Cause the Objects that are Foreign, the kids with baggy clothes
are the cats that I'm coolin with, when we be together
Two and two equals four but Foreign Objects be forever
So, just let me flow as I reach up to the next plateau
And then you'll give me my respect
Uhh, cause I'm a Foreign Object

Now get loose, get loose, A.J. Shine get loose
And just rock heart-beat showin you got the juice
And have fun  have fun 
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

First off, I'm burstin off shots of gab
and gettin lifted by the gift, I start to jab
The rhymes that I grab send schools to the slab
As I write scores, the funky orator's gone
on some next ish lookin
for the next fish with a wish that used to be a duck
but now you're stuck dumbstruck
Trying to hang but you can't swim I think you're fucked
You traded in your blues for boom, tap shoes
I do shows and change all opposing views
I get down, I go up as I blow up
cause I got this O.M.B. rhyme you can't defuse
Yeahhh, here to rock all of you rockers
When I carry the ball, I stay be-hind my blockers
I move swift, I needs no lift
I don't have to riff because I shift the gift
and now my name is Joseph Simmons, but I'm not Run
With the mic in my hand, I've only just begun
to hold mine, I'ma goldmine plus a ton
The way I shine, I be the rising sun, huh!
How many times must I have to say
this I never miss yo when I display?
From styles I paint the funky picture I portray and
before I hit the court I made it my forte
cause I got this, you can come and get this, cause my
method is the most and I boast so you can bet this
is like the best of the rest of the flock
And now you're walkin down the hallways of the Always Jock
Abbreviated A.J. here for the day
Bustin rhymes in your face while I'm fadin away
It's like that y'all, and ya don't stop
The funky Bid on the root with the hip-hop

Now.. get loose, get loose, ?uestion get loose
And, rock heart-beat showin YOU got juice
And have fun  have fun 
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

It's me the BROther ?uestion on the M-I-C to flow
To bust a fat rat-a-tat rhyme one mo' gen'
I'm flexin with my mental verbalistic chocolate
Sucker know you're listenin so please get off of it
A score and two years ago began the ?uestion's mission
South of 52nd Street, on ?
and anybody wanna diss the sure shot body rock
fresh flowin dude, we can take it to the stage
Sucker, Foreign Objects coming soon
From the rat cave to a room with a view
My brother's B.G., and my band is Josh U
And the stank whole rhythmic funk, plus my nuc'
You can comprehend the verbal letters that I send
Ahh, ooooh, ahhhh, like Boyz II Men
I don't have a Benz-y shoes are walkin like Jimmy
Make em say, "Yo ?uestion's demi," make em squeal like ?
Man, yo, I jams on every gram
Move out the way, I gets on, rockin round the clock
In school I used to doodle, nowadays I use my noodle
And I'll be rockin planets, and soon I'm livin fatter
I'm a levelheaded son who knows where I came from
Umm, lights, camera... ?uestion

Get loose, get loose, Black Thought get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got the juice
And have fun  have fun 
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!

Well umm, yik-yik yak-yak, chi-chi-chi-ka-SPLACK
Thoughts that I stutter and brother that I left back behind
Lines of swine I'm qualified for groovy stew achoo
I caught the boogie like the flu and God Bless the Black
Cardiac cerebral abstract cathedral
The mental is the temple and the central sees you tryin to flam!
Man I catch a lift like Bob Mar-ley, and par-lay
On airy clouds I drop, bombs like a Sau-di, Arabian
Flocks I rocks like Fabian
It's the nipple sex upon the grits that call me baby and
run a finger, through the knaps of the rap, singer that
pull a scat, from the stack, that I keep in the shack
of my soul, bring the bowl I got the flat out good
That's why I'm dug by the hippies plus the pimps and hoods
in the slum, could I umm, come, should I umm, come
Yes I does, and gets down said I wasn't know that I was
but they gel, that's why they blow up cause they didn't give spect
to the erector of the Foreign Object, I collect, to preserve
Plus develop and envelop in The Roots of rhyme
Yo that's the end of the line, I got mine, and I'm out

A-ha! Ahh, suki suki now
It's the Brother ?uestion
and now you know how it is
when the Foreign Objects get wreck
Like that, yeah, ha ha ha
And we out y'all, and we out y'all
And we out y'all, and we out y'all
And we out y'all...

And Black Thought sendin' out a shout to the Get Fresh Crew

Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with
Now it's time to spark shit

Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with
Now it's time to spark shit

Look God, I walk around a little edgy already
Y'all MC's come into my face, but my aim's steady
M-illitant is skilled in most strategic plan
I float across seas and, breezed across land
Standin', in these thoughts of murder within
The structure of this world that's corrupted with sin
I'm always hittin', to leave MC's guessin'
For any transgression, in my perimeter
There will be a blessing, and your explicit intoxicated
Buddha session, to stop stressin'
Me with the madness, puttin' niggaz on my had list
No sadness is felt, you shuffled and your cards get dealt
Jim Carrey ass niggaz start to melt
Impact like a buckle bein' swung from off a belt
Any help for shelter, when in the realms of a welter
My weight will tilt ya, hold alignments and change your filter
My attitude a product of society
So sometimes for gratitude, you know you can't rely on me
Niggaz eyein' me, with looks of they anxiety
Wonderin' what's in my heart, velocity or piety
Yo, it depends on which one, you bring to surface
At times I get trife, but what to worship is my purpose
Malik be blend with the tree, to spot an enemy
You cloggin' me up cat, now vacant the vicinity

Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with
Now it's time to spark shit

Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with
Now it's time to spark shit

I'm symbolic to a ballot, it's Abdul Malik
Don't approach with bullshit, I'm quick to call it invalid
Route through your district, we keep it simplistic
No need for the rapper to talk, put it on halt
Show me the vault, or the safe, cause I'm on the paper chase
Wade through route states for bout thirty down my waist
I'm tryin to get it, these rain bottlin' thoughts become acidic
With one in the chamber, ready to aim and spit it
A girlfriend and team made nigga cash just splintered
I take what you got to give, cause I got to live
The last hour, I bet your ass you act sour
Might act up, but I still can pass dowa
I'm usin' new ways to try to reach these better days
Instead of tryin' to take you under I just make you wonder
I still fast, make salaat, and pay zakaat
I didn't make Hajj yet, but that's my next project
Livin' two lives, one of turn and one with true lies
Keepin' a hoe, knowin' these hands into my do'as
In the quarters livin' modest with my nigga Trotter
I circle my foes, like tawaf around the kaba
I used to live life, like there was no ma'ana
Now I'm treatin' every breath, like it was your honor
I'm Mill-itill-itant with the Fifth that stand firm
Like a pillar, I'm I and T-L like Manilla

Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with
Now it's time to spark shit

Yo, the feet that I walk with
The ears that I hear with, the eyes that I see with
The mouth that I talk with, the terror that I stalk with
Now it's time to spark shit

This is what it's all about

Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire 
My vocal's a passport that never expire 
Crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire 
Screamin' out "the roots" while I balance wit the wire 
Yo, expert in this profession, the session 
In 1987, I linked up wit the question 
Eleven years later we shared crop wit Geffen 
In musical hell, but hip-hop forever heaven 
My thoughts, interwoven and deep like Beethoven 
This foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon 
Swollen wit minds that got stolen 
Fake-ass cops, uncontrollable patrolmen 
Torture, blood flow like bodies of water 
Fathers sexually assaultin' they own daughter 
Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle 
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle 
In a game of life, yo it's hard to roll a double 
Tryin' times, take lives and separate couples 
Kids thinkin' they grown, tellin' they moms "fuck you" 
Under they breath, livin' in the last times left 
Peep the imagery stretch across the sky like a canvas 
And we're the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness 
Time to set it off, let's spark this 
Switzerland, let's spark this!! 

We are the ultimate  
We are the ultimate  
We are the ultimate, rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it 
We are the ultimate  
We are the ultimate louder!  
We are the ultimate 
 c'mon  c'mon  

Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire 
You couldn't have a clue, it's about to transpire 
The books I buy live arms ?I wire? 
The fifth, similar to ghetto gospel choir 
We explore the whole states plus record 
In flight buds, trip that was a prisoner in war 
Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor 
But I could see the drop was a mile aboard 
To the bottom, electrical shock for rhymes 
I said "I don't got em", guess it kinda presented a problem 
When I understood, they said "let him go" 
I woke, during a center to London-Heathrow 
And now wit a past, fuckin' wit border patrol 
I'm findin' it out, I'm leakin' wit my people 
Hit the studio, spread this information 
In daze of frustration fogged the education 
From illa-fifth to switzerland destination 
The roots du journ, go check the translation 
The dictionary of devout topics, far from Ebonics 
The fifth dynast, they can't stop it 
Yo Zurich y'all keep it tight heed 
While the roots crew smoke weed 
Yo, we are the ultimate  
We are the ultimate, say what?  
We are the ultimate, c'mon 
 c'mon c'mon rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it 
We are the ultimate  
We are the ultimate louder  
We are the ultimate louder

I the voyeur, peer, as she begins her, ritual 
Paying sexual ties for few and untrue 
Words of admiration, translation: 
Sucker ass, lines, of trash 
Spewing from First One's unskilled lips 
That beg for pussy tricks that make his dick go quickly limp 
She pimps her innocence as Second One demands entrance 
Through the back door 
"Bend over bitch, you know this is what you were born for; 
To dig those soft and lotioned knees into the floor 
And take it in, that sweetly spread ass like a real pro whore" 
Her subsequent screams seemed to praise 
Sent messages of pleasure and pain to his fuck tainted brain 
But her screams masked laughs at his dumb ass 
As he quicker comes, then Third and Fourth One just as dumb 
Invite themselves to join in 
Third One wants to hit the skins old-fashioned style 
While Fourth One says, 
"Don't she got some DSL's, make a nigga joint just swell, 
To think? I want to sink my inches, into that bitch's, 
Berry-framed mouth" 
So one goes North, the other South 
To sanctified places where in-house spirits 
Will later wash away all traces, of their ill-spoken words 
And complacent faces 
And then, like their Minutemen, predecessors 
Lude, aggrandized sexual endeavors, end up rough 
Cause neither one of them could keep that weak shit up 
Corrupt, Fifth One steps to her 
Hip-Hop clothed just to, think he gonna impress her 
"Hey Slim, I heard you was a spinna, sit on up 
Top this thing, black dick, and work it like a winner" 
With the quickness he got his pseudo-thickness all up in her 
But suddenly he, stops mid thrust 

Seems she nameless to 'cause, got his stuff in a death cunt clutch 
He fast falls from the force of her tight pussy punch 
Just like the rest of that sorry ass bunch 
Now here comes Six ready to add his inactive shit to the mix 
Talkin' smack at that 
Saying, "Girl, I'ma wax that ass, and stick that slit so hard, 
You gonna be calling me God" 
So he proceeds to poke and prod 
With clumsy finger and wack sex slinger 
"Condoms make me last longer," wrong, cause her 
Motions of snatch, however detached from the situation 
Cause his pre pre PRE-ejaculation 
It seems she just wastin' 
Good pussy and time on dudes like Number Seven 
Who ain't learned their lesson 
He wants to enter the flesh divine 
By dropping a kind of semi-sweet line 
"Your honey hole so fine and mile deep; I'm gonna leap 
Into you like an ocean do you right and make your head spin" 
So he jumped in and then, he drowned 
Got lost and found in her Tart Canal 
Slave to the waves, made him cum for days 
Eighth and Last One turn arise 
Plys her with familiar lies 
Even more familiar still, cause 
Him she used to love 
But he never could quite see above, her mound 
A pound of flesh is all she was, no name no face or even voice 
So poised, she rises, Phoenix from the flame 
Finally bored with their feeble fuck games 
She smooth reaches behind her and takes straight aim 
At eight shriveled up cocks with a fully loaded Glock 
Parts lips, not expressly made for milding dicks 
And then, she speaks: 

Your shrieks of horror bring me bliss, I must admit 
The thought that I could shred your tips with eight quick flips 
Excites me, see y'all fuck with the pussy 
But I fuck with your minds 
Lack of soul and respect is the crime 
This, was a set up, now tell me what, what's my name?

Yo, where the freaks at? Lookin' at me
You wanna see Black? Then jump on it
And to the chumps who think they might want it
I might spot your ride and dump on it
And send a couple of boys to that corner of yours
And role out with a nigga slumped on it
You see Black fall back son
Me and Shock up in a black Regal no insurance
We like DEA serving warrants
So tell the freaks you know to stop whorin'
We gon' grab the mics and get 'em off the wall
So e'rybody in here can stop snorin'
Yo where the safe Money unlock it, pull it out your pocket
Ben Banniker Bay with the Al Morrocan
Black Thought on capitals like the sovereign
Girls get your eyes back up out the sockets
Focus, flawless, New York to Europe
To lands where my feet ain't even touch the soil yet
What a movement, the rap solution
It thumps so hard we got 'em world wide usin' them
Tracks from Black for satisfaction
The role of captain played by Samuel L. Jackson
Yo ill insanity that's cold and morbid
But when I'm in your orbit you soul absorb it
A real raw nigga won't fold or forfeit
A thorough bred gonna enforce it
Tariq's where the beats at
And where the people out their seats at
For what? Cause y'all on it
I'm like Aqua man and Brown Hornet
I'm like Imhotep but don't flaunt it
Dog, reintroducing master thespian
Ho-telling-est, elin-est, emceein'
Fuck getting money for real, get freedom
Black on the grind from AM to the PM
Splash up crash up the X-5 B.M
Motive entertainment the philly mob we in
Weak hearts, yo we not them
What up nigga T3 nigga Bahtem
When the M-Ill get home we're gonna win
First one to fall cats with no chin
The mic the black hold remain smokin'
And ladies up in the place is wide open
For real you know what I'm talking about
Pull it out your pocket

You feel this shit soon as they throw it on
You feel this joint this is your new favorite song
You at the dancehall, you got it going on
It's time to show it off so throw your hands up
Check it out yo
You feel this shit soon as they throw it on
You feel this joint this is your new favorite song
You at the dancehall, you got it going on
It's time to show it off y'all niggas know whats up

Yo here go the rapper of the year, year of the rap
Come from South Philly where the hammers are clapped huh?
Violate and you will answer to Black
You a thug not really there's the answer to that
Lee ya, boxed silly with the hands skill attack
Cancel your check flip, dismantle your trap huh?
Wanna pack can't handle your strap
You a schmuck type, shoot your man in the back
Meanwhile I'm outstanding and I'm outspoken
Wild out take fools out without joking
If I run out of shots I'm going out poking
On a date with sis we going out stroking
And the shot is fantastic
The fantastic is the romantic
And to the freaks in the house if you're ready to bounce
We can go to the flat then get tantric
Yeah, you pronounce the name Tariq, any questions?
Street hip-hop I bring forth the essence
You see pulling up five deep
With nothing but dimes inside of my jeep
I'm not arguing to get in VIP cocksucker prick
Suck a dick I'mma floss for the fuck of it
Girls say the bro Black be on some other shit
Nigga talk like you work for the government
My words worth like Barnes & Noble
Spit hot flames that'll harm your vocal
Spit thought name I'm a bomb your local
Neighborness, for a ten mile radius
Well every ghetto craving this new anthem
My brain unstable and I'm just too handsome
I bang with the best around
Who can test the crown when I finesse the sound
Here come the controller

You feel this shit soon as they throw it on
You feel this joint this is your new favorite song
You at the dancehall, you got it going on
It's time to show it off so throw your hands up
Check it out yo

Homicide or suicide
Heads or Tails
Some think life is a living hell
Some live life just living well
I live life tryna tip the scale
My way, my way
My way, my way

Yo, I'm always early
I never take off cause I got a job
Rob Peter to pay Paul
Now I realize it's the winner that takes all
Do what I gotta do because I can't take loss
Picture me living life as if I'm some animal
That consumes its own dreams like I'm a cannibal
I won't accept failure unless it's mechanical
But still the alcohol mixed with the botanical
I guess I be referred to the owners manual full of loaners
Full of all the homeless throwaways and the stoners
Soldiers of the streets with 8th grade diplomas
And the world awaiting their shoulders as a bonus
Look, let he without sin live without sin
Until then, I'll be doing dirty jobs like swamp men
Counting the faces of those that might have been
It's like living that life but I won't live that life again

Homicide or suicide
Heads or Tails
Some think life is a living hell
Some live life just living well
I live life tryna tip the scale
My way, my way
My way, my way

Lot of niggas go to prison
How many come out Malcolm X?
I know I'm not
Shit, can't even talk about the rest
Famous last words: "You under arrest"
Will I get popped tonight? It's anybody's guess
I guess, a nigga need to stay cunning
I guess when the cops comin' need to start runnin'
I won't make the same mistakes from my last run in
You either done doing crime now or you done in
I got a brother on the run and one in
Wrote me a letter, he said when you comin'
Shit man, I thought the goal's to stay out
Back against the wall, then shoot your way out
Gettin' money's a style that never plays out
'Til you end up boxin' your stash, money's paid out
The scales of justice ain't equally weighed out
Only two ways out, digging tunnels or digging graves out

Homicide or suicide
Heads or Tails
Some think life is a living hell
Some live life just living well
I live life tryna tip the scale
My way, my way
My way, my way

Homicide or suicide
Heads or Tails
Some think life is a living hell
Some live life just living well
I live life tryna tip the scale
My way, my way
My way, my way

Yeah, U.N.I.Verse
At war
U.N.I.Verse 
At war motherfucker
We gonna do this Chi-town style 
Illadelph, you know how we get down
You know the business 
Bringin it straight to your chest 
Yessah, hah, yeah 
Break it down one two 

When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor
When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor

Check it, rappers
Get on the mic talk about cars and clothes
Sounding like hoes
Ain't been exposed to the foes,the moes, disciples
I'm from the state that is Ill, the rap son of man
Rotated down to Phil, to say what I feel
Get it off my bird chest, my word becomes flesh
War, going on between the West and the East
Of the land, niggas don't own a piece
Grease is the word, Murray slides some pimp oil to me
My lady friend sneaks my beer in the movie
Throw your hands in the air, if you the true and living
Beware, the new world order, the devil's new religion
Sent my homey to the number two division
Sellin bootleg movies, got my VCR on a ove' smove'
Be at Fat Tuesday's, drinkin tropical it's just sittin
At a table with sophisticated bitches
Nah that ain't nothin I would call my mother
Nor do I call every nigga my brother
Gotta have Black Thought, it's sorta B like Malik
So don't Question a Brother, to the Roots I get deep

Yo, enter the last era
Your scholarship into the world of politics
And mascara, we operate within this artificial op-era
I bring hip-hop terror like the Fuhrer
The Ace Ventura into the horror
Laboratory laborer, venture beyond the border
I'll struc-ture a style destroy your whole aura
Plus you're a-drenalin'll rise before your eyes
And mortalize, my image hit the skies
Deceive the devil in disguise
My music I parenthesize
Represent the wise, through this be how we enterprise
Kid no compromise  I'm thinkin fast like Rama-
Dan, I wear your mind away like Alzheimer
I pull a mic up out my bomber big up to Bahama-
Dia, A-O this year we leavin em in trauma
Then after me, I plan to leave behind, the legacy
Or history of the family, the fifth dynasty
For humanity, to bear witness to this
Del-val-syllable stylist
You know the time kid

When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor
When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor

Yo, the general flows, kids compose on tablet
Expose how they was average
And they thoughts not rapid
Here comes the hot package, through your block like traffic
The rock was typed graphic now watch the mic blast it
Shootin at the stars with emphatic rap static
See the mirror shatter from thoughts, I'm bustin back at it
The Lieuten-ant, the ele-phant, sippin automatic
Mic, rippin asiatic, architects out to have it
The turn of the century, the planet's like a penitentiary
Exaggerated, niggas is livin highly medicated
I Used to Love Her but now she violated
Hip-hop holocaust and camps, old champs are concentrated
They outdated and incarcerated
Loved and appreciated hated and very debated
For every career created was eliminated
And that's the way the balance of yin and yang related

Every Block is divine
Niggas swing on in a safari
Wild niggas, like I'm high on latari
Some let the block, block they mind, if they could see what I see
Get out the city for a sec be at the places I be
Hey, I'mma be back on the deck, opening
Business in places for you to cash your check
My, neck of the woods ain't all good ain't all bad
You can live in the burbs, and still get had
The sad part about it niggas had houses on the lake
They tryin to move us out, the land we ain't appreciate
For peace we skate, crackers be rollerblading on hate
Call each other cuz cause of how we relate
I see way too many Cadillacs with dope man plates
Through the wind and blow-ups, is how niggas communicate
Harmonizing through beeper and reefer
The city got my peoples in a sleeper, talk is getting cheaper

When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor
When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor
When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor

Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire 
My vocal's a passport that never expire 
Crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire 
Screamin' out "the roots" while I balance wit the wire 
Yo, expert in this profession, the session 
In 1987, I linked up wit the question 
Eleven years later we shared crop wit Geffen 
In musical hell, but hip-hop forever heaven 
My thoughts, interwoven and deep like Beethoven 
This foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon 
Swollen wit minds that got stolen 
Fake-ass cops, uncontrollable patrolmen 
Torture, blood flow like bodies of water 
Fathers sexually assaultin' they own daughter 
Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle 
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle 
In a game of life, yo it's hard to roll a double 
Tryin' times, take lives and separate couples 
Kids thinkin' they grown, tellin' they moms "fuck you" 
Under they breath, livin' in the last times left 
Peep the imagery stretch across the sky like a canvas 
And we're the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness 
Time to set it off, let's spark this 
Switzerland, let's spark this!! 

We are the ultimate  
We are the ultimate  
We are the ultimate, rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it 
We are the ultimate  
We are the ultimate louder!  
We are the ultimate 
 c'mon  c'mon  

Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire 
You couldn't have a clue, it's about to transpire 
The books I buy live arms ?I wire? 
The fifth, similar to ghetto gospel choir 
We explore the whole states plus record 
In flight buds, trip that was a prisoner in war 
Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor 
But I could see the drop was a mile aboard 
To the bottom, electrical shock for rhymes 
I said "I don't got em", guess it kinda presented a problem 
When I understood, they said "let him go" 
I woke, during a center to London-Heathrow 
And now wit a past, fuckin' wit border patrol 
I'm findin' it out, I'm leakin' wit my people 
Hit the studio, spread this information 
In daze of frustration fogged the education 
From illa-fifth to switzerland destination 
The roots du journ, go check the translation 
The dictionary of devout topics, far from Ebonics 
The fifth dynast, they can't stop it 
Yo Zurich y'all keep it tight heed 
While the roots crew smoke weed 
Yo, we are the ultimate  
We are the ultimate, say what?  
We are the ultimate, c'mon 
 c'mon c'mon rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it 
We are the ultimate  
We are the ultimate louder  
We are the ultimate louder 
 c'mon rock-rockin' it, rock-rockin' it

Yeah, U.N.I.Verse
At war
U.N.I.Verse 
At war motherfucker
We gonna do this Chi-town style 
Illadelph, you know how we get down
You know the business 
Bringin it straight to your chest 
Yessah, hah, yeah 
Break it down one two 

When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor
When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor

Check it, rappers
Get on the mic talk about cars and clothes
Sounding like hoes
Ain't been exposed to the foes,the moes, disciples
I'm from the state that is Ill, the rap son of man
Rotated down to Phil, to say what I feel
Get it off my bird chest, my word becomes flesh
War, going on between the West and the East
Of the land, niggas don't own a piece
Grease is the word, Murray slides some pimp oil to me
My lady friend sneaks my beer in the movie
Throw your hands in the air, if you the true and living
Beware, the new world order, the devil's new religion
Sent my homey to the number two division
Sellin bootleg movies, got my VCR on a ove' smove'
Be at Fat Tuesday's, drinkin tropical it's just sittin
At a table with sophisticated bitches
Nah that ain't nothin I would call my mother
Nor do I call every nigga my brother
Gotta have Black Thought, it's sorta B like Malik
So don't Question a Brother, to the Roots I get deep

Yo, enter the last era
Your scholarship into the world of politics
And mascara, we operate within this artificial op-era
I bring hip-hop terror like the Fuhrer
The Ace Ventura into the horror
Laboratory laborer, venture beyond the border
I'll struc-ture a style destroy your whole aura
Plus you're a-drenalin'll rise before your eyes
And mortalize, my image hit the skies
Deceive the devil in disguise
My music I parenthesize
Represent the wise, through this be how we enterprise
Kid no compromise  I'm thinkin fast like Rama-
Dan, I wear your mind away like Alzheimer
I pull a mic up out my bomber big up to Bahama-
Dia, A-O this year we leavin em in trauma
Then after me, I plan to leave behind, the legacy
Or history of the family, the fifth dynasty
For humanity, to bear witness to this
Del-val-syllable stylist
You know the time kid

When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor
When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor

Yo, the general flows, kids compose on tablet
Expose how they was average
And they thoughts not rapid
Here comes the hot package, through your block like traffic
The rock was typed graphic now watch the mic blast it
Shootin at the stars with emphatic rap static
See the mirror shatter from thoughts, I'm bustin back at it
The Lieuten-ant, the ele-phant, sippin automatic
Mic, rippin asiatic, architects out to have it
The turn of the century, the planet's like a penitentiary
Exaggerated, niggas is livin highly medicated
I Used to Love Her but now she violated
Hip-hop holocaust and camps, old champs are concentrated
They outdated and incarcerated
Loved and appreciated hated and very debated
For every career created was eliminated
And that's the way the balance of yin and yang related

Every Block is divine
Niggas swing on in a safari
Wild niggas, like I'm high on latari
Some let the block, block they mind, if they could see what I see
Get out the city for a sec be at the places I be
Hey, I'mma be back on the deck, opening
Business in places for you to cash your check
My, neck of the woods ain't all good ain't all bad
You can live in the burbs, and still get had
The sad part about it niggas had houses on the lake
They tryin to move us out, the land we ain't appreciate
For peace we skate, crackers be rollerblading on hate
Call each other cuz cause of how we relate
I see way too many Cadillacs with dope man plates
Through the wind and blow-ups, is how niggas communicate
Harmonizing through beeper and reefer
The city got my peoples in a sleeper, talk is getting cheaper

When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before
Steppin up into a zone you should never explore
The next level or, level of the whole conceptor
When you and I verse at war 
And your verse at core, for what you thought before

When I think about perfect times
I think about yesterday
You can asked me about the future
I don't know what to say
Tomorrow's story's unknown
So listen
It's almost anyone's guess
Unwritten
When I think about perfect times
I think about yesterday
You can ask me about the future
I don't know what to say
It's almost anyone's guess

Yo,
It was a cold night
Not cold like the winter
Just cold like a energy was in the air
I generally don't like
The driver had to dip, so he left me in the whip
Turned around and said, 
I'm the zone like
There's pictures on the wall of my own life
Just like a drive-in
Only it's live, and this a montage of the places I been
My sixth sense taste the problem
The sus-pense had my heart racin', throbbin'
Just like a young punk with a tape revolver
Pointed at the driver of a car, faced to rob him
The cigarettes chased the vodka
The nigga just chased the dream but won't taste the monster
The son won't face the father
The gun won't erase the drama
While you're waitin', the time's up

Wake up everybody no more sleepin' in bed
No more backward thinkin' time for thinkin' ahead
The world has changed so very much
From what it used to be
There is so much hatred war and poverty
Oh yeah

Wake up all the teachers time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen to whatcha have to say
Cause they're the ones who's coming up 
And the world is in their hands
When you teach the children 
Teach 'em the very best you can
Oh yeah

The world won't get no better 
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better 
We gotta change it yeah, 
Just you and me.

Wake up all the doctors make the ol' people well
They're the ones who suffer an' who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long before the Judgment Day
So won'tcha make them happy before they pass away.

Wake up all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do is put it in our minds
Surely things will work out cause they do every time.

The world won't get no better 
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better 
We gotta change it yeah, 
Just you and me.

Yeah, yeah

It's the God hour
The morning I wake up
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers
My mom buidin' on skyscrapers and acres
He said take us back to where we belong
I try to write a song
As sweet as the Psalms
Though I'm the type to bare arms
And wear my heart on my sleeve
Even when I fell in God I believe
Read the days that weave through the maze
The seasons so amazing
Feed them and raised them
Seasons are aging
Earthquakes, wars, and rumors
I want us to get by but
We're more than consumers
We more than shooters, more than looters
Created in this image so God live through us
And even in this generation, living through computers
Only love love love can reboot us

Wake up everybody no more sleepin' in bed
Wake up, everybody
Need a little help,
Can't do it alone
Need a little help y'all
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon
Need a little help, y'all 
Can't do it alone
Need a little help, y'all 
Can't do it alone
Oh, wake up everybody
Wake up everybody
Wake up everybody

Trapped, no shield, no sword
The unbeaten path got my soul so sore
Allured by the lust, something money can't cure
The Devil want me as is, but God he want more
Eyes closed, eyes open--great another day, here we go
Like a nigga woke up late in the Truman Show
Living life without a care, mean poker face
But I'm forced to play solitaire till I get up out of here
Move like a wanted man with a bounty on his head
Work alone, sleep alone, eat alone, daily bread
Counting till my fingers red; how you gon' judge a man
Walking in the shoes of a man with a broken leg?
Flame on the trail headed for the powder keg
Last place in the race I ain't never led
Like I ain't never bled, time to get up out of bed
Serving in the army of one, it's on again

Walk alone, I walk alone; you know I walk it alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I born
So I don't mind walking alone
Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk it alone
I always been on my own ever since the day I born
So I don't mind walking alone

I'm in a chess match; I'm in a death trap
I'm tryna find out where the eggs in the nest at
I want blood when the sky turns jet black
No love in the world can correct that
I'm in a slow lane; I'm on my Cobain
I'm in the new spot tryna run a old game
I got a new chick; put out my old flame
No peace, no sleep, no love for a young beast
You can put me in a cage
You can put me in the jungle where the lion get blazed
There ain't no hell like the hell I raise
I'd die in the bed I made 'fore I lay with a love I loathe
I'm a snake in the garden of bones
I'm a loner in a world of clones
I'm the piece that don't belong
See, I roam where the the Reaper roam
Till they put my name on a stone

The longest walk I'll probably ever be on
The Road to Perdition, guess I'm finna get my plea on
I pray these wings strong enough to carry me on
I promise every second felt as if it took an eon
Walking like the lost boys of Sierra Leone
The Trail of Tears what they got me like a Cherokee on
Between the ears something I require therapy on
For the working the bone like my name Robert Dion
I go above and beyond--the duty called truly, y'all
Even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call
Asked me if I'm just another muli or a movie star
Forced to face the music like a graduate of Juilliard
Walk alone, talk alone, get my Charlie Parker on
Make my mark alone, shed light upon the dark alone
Get my sparkle on; it's a mission I'm embarking on
A kamikaze in the danger zone far from home

South Philly, North Side
Oakland, Texas
Georgia, Black People
Yo, Worldwide, Sup my nigga
You know what I'm saying
Dumb and blind

They say a record ain't nothing if it's not touching
Gripping, draw you in closer make you want to listen to it
And if you real ill at making music
Then lesson will feel like you livin' through it
That's how my nigga do it
I met Slacks back in like '91 rapping
We went to Millersville to get away from gun clappin'
It ain't last
I be in class dreaming 'bout
50,000 fans up in the stands screaming out
Encore, yo I'm headed back to Philly
Nigga you rollin' with me?
I'm trying to get busy
We walk dogs that was off the chain
Lot of times at the show people hardly came
I just took it in stride as part of the game
But inside people down with me started to change
It was a couple things
Lil' , lil' pills
Instead of driving out on the road you rather chill
I know the way the pleasure feel
I'm not judging
But still I'm on a mission, yo I'm not buggin'
I got fam that won't stop druggin' 
They can't sleep
They can't stick to one subject, they can't eat
Is people steady comin' at me out in the streets
Like Riq yo wat up with your peeps
It gets deep nigga

Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high
Son you missin' out on was passing you by
I done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry
But not you and I my nigga
We got to get
Come on, over over the water 
Come on, over over the water
Water, Water

Yo, we done made too many meals
A couple of deals
We done share clothes and wills
Killed mics and reels
We done rock
Shows abroad, and slept on floors
Trying to figga what the fuck we gettin' slept on for
Oh why we walking with the rep up for
Waited by the cavity law
You know it if you came up poor my nigga
Picture a bus up north
You know we made of everything outlaws are made of
I'm far from a hater
And I don't say I love you 'cause the way I feel is greater
In Illa you a poet son
You a ball creator
And this will probably dawn on you later
Is in you nature, letters all up in the wall like they made of paper
You got to find out where you talent take you
You might fuck around, finally make it
And that's real but yo

Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high
Son you missin' out on was passing you by
I done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry
But not you and I my nigga
We got to get
Come on, over over the water 
Come on, over over the water
Water, Water

Yo, I want you all to understand I come from South Philly
And when I walk the street is like a pharmacy
They got all type of shit
Anybody could get
It goes from H to Ex
To lucy ciggarette
For my ghetto legend
Known from Lil' shyst running
Cop codeine by the courts and keep comin'
Dummy, just embracing the dope like it's a woman
You burnin' both sides of the rope and keep pullin'
Tuggin', in between Islam and straight tuggin'
Laying everyday around the way and doin' nothin'
See'em looking shaking their head and start shruggin'
If they don't have a man like mine, they got a cousin
Hey yo you better be a true friend to 'em
Before the shit put an end to 'em
Or give a pen to 'em
Or lock'em up in the studio with a mic
'Cause on the real it might save his life
Keep tellin'em

Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high
Son you missin' out on was passing you by
I done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry
But not you and I my nigga
We got to get
Come on, over over the water 
Come on, over over the water
Water, Water
Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high
Son you missin' out on was passing you by
I done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry
But not you and I my nigga
We got to get
Come on, over over the water 
Come on, over over the water
Water, Water

And it weights a ton
'Riq geez motherfuckers I'm a son of a gun
Black master of any trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue
Clear my path and come get your captain hung
Trying to breath like black'll collapse your lungs
Young chump you could choke off the web I spun
I done cleared 'em out from the threat I brung
You done heard about what set I'm from
My nigga, word-a-mouth little rule-a-thumb
Y'all better bow down when the ruler come
I'm a real hood nigga not a hood-a-lum
The way Thought put it down be confusin' some of y'all
Cats can't walk while chewin' your gum 'n all
With a keyboard got do with a drum 'n all
School 'em on stage like I'm doin' a seminar
Professional type, I'm adjusting my mic
Go to war kid I'll give you any weapon you like
Give you something to run from
Bust off your dum-dum
Stop kid, that hot shit you know where it come from
It's philly world-wide phenomenon
And reinforcin' that shit is my nine to five
And when I finish making you recognize
I'm getin' at a couple civilized women that's tryin' to ride
You were waitin' on the raw to come off the oil
You wanna get the bitches up off the wall
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
To keep you in health, this for all of y'all
I'm quick on the draw like Black McGraw
And I can't tell what y'all cats rappin' for
My name 'riq geez and I'm back for more
To get more chips than the corner store
With a portrait of Malcom X on the door
While I'm eatin' MCs like a carnivore
Matter fact, ease back 'fore you get harmed
Ring the, warning horn when I'm gon' perform
The first nigga that move, or disturb the groove
I'm a have y'all flicks on the evening news
Play y'all part, get on y'all P's and Q's
And when y'all think Thought, be prepared to lose
Bring money to spend and somebody to lend
And some worthwhile money not twenties and tens
Get took for your tuck right in front of your 'hens
Who coulda help you nigga, not none of ya friends
Because, I put a black fist under ya chin
Have your physical remains found under the pen
If I'm coming up in the place, I'm coming to win
Wasn't in it for a minute, now I'm dumbin' again
'Riq geez ock, y'all can chat what y'all please
Receive what I'm gonna give back to y'all please
'Cuz y'all don't really wanna get clapped with all these
My man, you can take y'all strap when y'all leave
You see the squad come in the place, they all freeze
Ice cold, with his mellow cool breeze
MCs, never showed loyalty yet
Kool Herc ain't never get a royalty check
I do work, no question, and bomb your set
I'm calm collect, sharp like my name Gillette
RIP my man Gillette
Until I touch the mic, y'all people ain't seen danger yet
I'm a decorated vet, I regulate and wreck
Never hesitated yet, I'm gettin' heavy weighted checks
If you would dare ask if I'm dedicated - yes
I spit, live rounds that would penetrate a vest
Nigga, take ya seats I'm a demonstrate a test
How to freak the beats, so gangsta fresh
And it thump, from the east coast to Bangladesh
Big bank, willy gank smoke the thing to death
But hold tight, cuz it's not over yet
I don't even feel like I'm not sober yet
And it ring like shots in the projects new year's eve
And it ain't even October yet
I'm a big bounty hunter like Boba Fett
Y'all more shell shocked then a soldier get
If the prize in my sights then I'm goin' for this
Whoo whoo 'riq geez be the ultimate
I'm the corporate, give me the bulk of this
'Riq set it on the magnetic ultra tip
Get down how you 'posed to get
I got nothing to lose, I'm a killer with no regrets
I'm like young LL, cuz I'm hard as hell
Makin' niggaz screw face like Gargamel
Now I'm all out on my own like Patty LaBelle
Put the pimp game down on your mademoiselle

Yo, Jam Boy Magic, Mr. Fantastic
Masterful mind, the list that I've crafted
Fresh new trick to flip--I'm Dick Dastard
Half smooth criminal and half straight bastard
No mask when your flag get captured
First class, take you to the rap hereafter
Gone in a flash and yet he gets faster
Sick when he hits the mic like Mix-master
This the Battle of Troy with no Pastor
Slicker than a can of oil with no Castor
Chill in the front of the flight, outclass them
Bring your favorite rapper to fight, I'll trash him
Then I'll leave in a timely fashion
Uh, emcees get the tiny rations
Your girl hold me close as a tiny dancer
You got a death wish? Well it's finally answered, prick

Yo, Jam Boy Magic, Mr. Sarcastic
Rap catalog consists of all classics
Blackness, tell your bitch to fall backwards
Fuck a hood pass--my shit's for all-access
Killing tracks like this we call practice
Any bullshit y'all twist we call backwards
Jam Boy sharp as a tack--we all cactus
Waiting on a big payback with no taxes
So if you follow the game, you might catch this
Act like an activist--you know, active
Nigga like me just has to spit acid
Sucker like you just has to get blasted
Ashes to ashes, Frasier to Cassius
No homo--y'all some pains in the asses
Get turned to toast like raising your glasses
When I'm on stage, girls swing from the rafters
Often nasty like Monster Mashing
Y'all know the voice is tight, hoarse, and raspy
Can't place the face, kind of hard to catch me
Kings that pull strings like Dorothy Ashby
Johns keep telling me I'm great like Gatsby
Caught like a felony, you can't slide past me
I'm low-key, kind of anti-flashy
Then I'm O-G up in a black tie classy
Sun Tzu to Sun Rai, Gargemel, Mumm-Ra
Son of a shooter letting slugs from a gun fly
Should call a Mumbai with the bumbaclot
It's Black Thought; my sound's hard to come by
Last spotted on a yacht getting dumb high
Banging yacht rock with my squad from 2-1-5
Straight calling niggas out like the umpire
Any chump tryna front 

Jam Boy Magic, Mr. Get-Busy; you get busy too?
Then get with me; we'll get busy, dig me?
Smooth Remy, tool skinny, but hold plenty
.22 long contact, new Bentley
No miles yet, curve backs and cruise and he
Bring it back when you through with it, roger that
Grip tenny, French mammies in Vic' panties
Lips candy, dick hard as a fifth of brandy
Hop in it for five minutes; then I'm finished
'Cause pussy is pleasure, but I'm attending my business
Retractable roof, magical coupe disappearing
And reappearing; German engineering this McLaren
Hot jacuzzis, watching movies, glock and Uzis
Shots of Louis, busting cuties, popping jewelries
Oh, oh, Ultramag' emcee in a M-3
Whole body tatted straight up out a MP

Do you wanna know what goes on?

Yo, niggas can not see me, can not be me or
Capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when I tour
I am but a messanger born to blow up
My niggas knew it all the time, lyrically I was a dime
At the age of nine, shorty Black, could rhyme
On the mic I never wasted time, I'm, the exquisite wizard
When I visit shorties I hit it I'm cool as a blizzard
Nigga what? You want, I'll bust your fronts, with the butt of my
Black paper chase ya and then erase ya rhyme
Sucker, MC's how I hate it when you waste your time
My state of mind, shine like it's diamond studded
I rhyme budded on stage, word is bond, when I'm on, I rage
Got the 12 gauge at the rest so play, and into rest you lay
My everyday M.O. is gettin dough cause times is rougher
Than a mother for brothers to scuffle shuffle your cards kid
Cause the odds is, niggas'll hustle and live, foul
This wild environment hostile produce, the music in me
So my style's the blend of what is and was
You could get a buzz from it, but enter too deep
And reach a summit you fall and then plummit beyond real
Where you're killed if your raps ain't ill
Another crab motherfucker 'nother cap to peel
Through these amps, I motivate camps to dance
Niggas too advanced, I warn, I'm just tellin you what goes on

Do you wanna know what goes on?

Inside my head, you wish to see
The signs appear, the shit's not clear
What if I flipped, would you know how to maintain your edge
I'm takin heads because, there's no fuckin ledge
I pledge allegiance to my cosmic guide
I couldn't fit in three dimensions if I tried
Civilizations I can delete, so crews don't bother me
Battle with Jehovah gaining universal soveirgnty
Niggas run around like clones, I got planets and thrones
Throughout the galaxy my name's well known 
I'm all alone in my zone, you wouldn't understand
Stare in my face, fuck around and catch a sun tan

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members
They shall hinder, wavin white flags, man we surrender
Those half-assed negroes know they're no contenders
In syringes, I can shoot up lyrical vengeance
And my grammar, might do a mandatory life in slammers
You should regret it, thinkin about steppin to me
Niggas forget it - you'll get gassed with lyrics leaded
Most energetic, I never snag I'm tightly threaded
I flip scripts like pattern twistness in calisthetics
Black Thought, Elo and me a trio
Talent is strong, word is bond
I'm just tellin you what goes on

Do you wanna know what goes on?

Do you wanna know what goes on?

Yo, niggas can not see me, can not be me or
Capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when I tour

Black Thought, Elo and me a trio
Talent is strong, word is bond
I'm just tellin you what goes on

Do you wanna know what goes on?

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Yo, yo
Lost generation, fast paced nation
World population confront they frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money makin'
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man? Then stand your own
To emcee requires skills; I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin'
And roam like a cellular phone far from home
Givin' crowds what they wantin'
Official hip-hop consumption, the fifth thumpin'
Keepin' ya party jumpin' with an original somethin'
Yo, I dedicate this to the one dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said, "Yo, we thought we heard you"
Joke's on you; you heard a bitin'-ass crew, but um

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured; it's nothing sacred
Aiyyo, it's funny when I see some rap niggas due to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine to five is just to hit ya; get the party live
I'm black thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhymes sayin' rent payin' life support
I take it very seriously within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me, from doin' tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds to send to stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now, who can stop the music runnin' through these veins?
Infinitely go against the grain; that's why my motto's to

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Livin' the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick to hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission welcomin' to the dark
When I first spark the arts, when the listenin' start
Open your head wide, and let the thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadel-phi
I've dealt more stealth than all the wicked wealthy
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short "I want it made" like Ed; 'nuff said
Then after that, I'm puttin' on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark skin thoroughbred
And discover my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuin' to

Never do what they do, what they do, what they do

Here's what you want right
Here's what you need right
We got to give you more
Of what you're lookin' for

So it's a secret that's been pent up inside for years
Exclusive type, only for your eyes and ears
You held it in for so long you bursted into tears
The letters spilled slowly across the page like a world premiere
Well I ain't, the bullshit begins here
The obvious cause, the effects is unclear
The punishment for crimes of the heart could be severe
Though to keep it on the low is a heavy cross to bear
You deep now, submerged with no signs of air
Still your sunken heart thumpin' like the kick in a snare
While on the surface it's all turnin' to a circus
That's why you're nervous, and you got a right to be
Cause if somebody woulda done that shit to me
I mean my best man hittin' my wife-to-be
My sentiments exactly would be history
Why'know what I'm sayin my peoples in the place let's hit it off one two

Yo, it's like nothin' changed, it's all the same thang
The same characters in a book, with different names
It's a lot more to lose than you got to gain
You a lot more confused than hip to the game
The peep the script of the game the price is pain
Men and women get into things, now who's to blame?
When everybody whisperi'n bout whatever took place
And how the fact twist a knot with a straight face
And lies, hard to swallow from the bitter taste
Well that's a point in the past that can't be erased
So motivate, though it's hard to let it ride
Or set aside true feelings, underhand dealings
Our lost trust, I wonder if we lost us
It's bigger than me and you, it's monstrous
So I'ma, just calm down and try to relax
Before I clap ????????

If you could only flash back and undo our actions
Change what happens, dissect the fractions
A time to rewind and be recorded absent
For real cause these memories is photographic
Pornographic, pushing me close to madness
Head heavy like I'm trippin' on tablets
Yesterday as I recall was all fabulous I thought so
But now it feel like shots hittin' my torso
Spent a lotta time and trust in the wrong place
Fought a lotta fights rollin' with the wrong ace
Love, stronger than pride, we could end disgrace
I need, room the think, and space to ventilate
Was solid as a rock, shall not disintegrate
Thoughts racing like the lunatics on the interstate
For real, ya, it's ill, ya, my peoples in the place

Here's what you want right
Here's what you need right
We got to give you more
Of what you're lookin' for

So it's a secret that's been pent up inside for years

Thoughts racing like the lunatics on the interstate
For real, ya, it's ill, ya, my peoples in the place

Lights, camera, chemical reaction
Attracted to a body of lies with fat asses
Thank the most high for high of high fashion
My art of war is killer couture, denim assassin

Am I a douchebag or just another doo rag?
Tryna get ahead on some brand new wave shit
For your entertainment money is the language
So every time I speak I'm tryna make another payment
I do 'em dirty sleep and get a dirt nap, that works
Tell my P.O. ask me where I work at
Think I woulda learned that sleeping in the bird trap
Living on the run like somebody tryna burn fat
I don't give a fuck, now maybe that's abstinence
Or the arrogance of someone who ain't got shit
That think money over bitches is a stock tip

I live in a trap where fiends load crack
Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin' he ain't never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer

I'm down to 95 dollars, that's the extent of my riches
Out of 99 problems, 98 of 'em is bitches
Out here hollerin' what's ironic is
I've honestly been tryna do what's right
But from your legs in the air tonight, like Phil Collins
I'm a sex-addicted introvert
Sucker for a pencil skirt
Looking for a shorty coming from work, that I can pervert
On my existential grind doing consequential dirt
Searchin' for physical pleasure if I don't go mental first
Molly poppin', trolley hoppin'
Know somebody prolly watchin'
That ain't stoppin' me from coppin' a feel
Karate choppin' in this after-hours spot
Watching mommy body rockin'
First I feed her vodka shots then she eat my Jonnie Cochran
Livin' fast, drinkin' capt'
One of them hoes even had
The audacity ask me how long this thing would last
I said, 'You wanna pay for class? Get on that stage and shake your ass'
She keep a dick in a box and in an emergency break the glass
I make her laugh
She makes it clap
And then she gives me lap dances and I'm thankful that
She keeps providing the place for me to be unfaithful at

I live in a trap where fiends load crack
Wake up in the boxes with a box of Apple Jacks
Everybody acts like God is all that
But I got the feelin' he ain't never coming back
So I got an angel that answer my prayer
Floating on the cloud that I blow in the air
Nobody wins but nobody cares
They just want blood when the people cheer

Wholy holy

Wholy holy

Why?

Sky's the limit so you know I'm gonna rise and shine
I gotta do my thing, I'm kinda getting a little tired of all that's hidden
That's the reason I'm a speak my mind, keep from going insane
Now work with it, we in the last innin'
The world keeps spinnin', my peoples steady losin' while the rich keep winnin'
It's like we neva smilin' and the devil steady grinnin'
Killin' what we representin'
Even our children and women, 2K4, livin' above and under the law
Young teen joins the marines, says he'll die for the core
Inducted up into the government's war as if the land of money and oil
Funny how ain't none of it yours
I can't sleep yo I'm paranoid, it's code orange
It's far from right, I guess that's why it feels so wrong
To see the world get stripped out of every resource
And people pray to Coca-Cola now instead of the gods
What's goin' on?

Why

Keepin' your head above water, hustlin' to survive
Some people chasin' a dream, others just chasin' a high
Some people blind leading the blind, they chasin' a lie
Some people chokin' backs broken barely makin' it by
But still they workin' all they live, they pushin' for the light
Givin' everything they got to stitch them swishes on ya Nike's
Puttin' pockets on our jeans, mining diamonds for them rings
Rewarded with small change and bullets in the brains
And it makes me feel strange everything we take for granted
At times I feel stranded on this planet of mine
Now should I pull the hammer, clap it out, and laugh about it
Or stand up, be counted while I cast my ballot
When the undertaker's busy and the prison's is crowded
People livin' in fear because they vision is clouded
But the sky's the limit, I ain't cryin' you a river
Gotta move me a mountain, I'm a git up and shout it

Why?

When I dream it's hounds on my heels gainin' momentum
I'm tired, can't get uninspired or quit runnin'
I can feel they only inches behind, I escape, I survive
Some how I gotta decide how much I want it
Or is anybody listenin' without a pot to piss in
If I disappear I wonder if the world will know I'm missin'
Who my support system, it's not the court system
Gotta letter it said that you're not avoiding prison
People 'neath the microscope 'cause we defining the culture
They smile and insult you like you shinin' their loafers
Them old heads say we need a modern day Moses
When the leaders is posers we needing some soldiers
It's the X generation, the anger is a nature
Got the writing on the wall so clear that I can taste it
Like a kid sniffing glue somewhere trying to escape
Cause we vulnerable and naked
Gotta show 'em we can make it

Why?

Without a doubt

Check it out now, it's the type cerebral
World renowned, illustrious, ille-gal
My musical affection, bubblin' within your zone
Like champagne, known as the Fifth campaign
Thought be doin' his damn thang
Bent like, a boomerang, tryin' to maintain
I'm both yin and yang from Mi Kan Lang
What your lady gettin' me up? I'm never answering
Let her miss me, see me then she off tryin' to kiss me
Talkin' 'bout, "I dig you Tariq, the way you twist me"
Meanwhile, she comin' home tipsy, all grinnin'
And what you used to fit em before, you now swimmin'
Just take a dive P-5 deep, the team winnin'
Takin' hip-hop back to, the beginnin'
Cause MC's are pretendin', I slap your sound
Out the sky like I'm goaltendin', bring your career
To an endin', enter the next era trascendin' for real
Knahmsayin? If not, then man listen
For you to try to fuck with the Fifth, that's ambition
I let y'all know the time indeed, y'all need to
Take heed y'all

Get a little P-5-D y'all
Straight from the town of Phil-ly y'all
But we about to give you what you need y'all
Without a doubt

Take heed y'all, get a little P-5-D y'all
Straight from the town of Phil-ly y'all
But we about to give you what you need y'all
Without a doubt

Yo, I control the stadium like the law long arm
Warn, ring the alarm, cause here The Roots come
The funk's all ready for whoever want some
Your album get split like, a lump sum
No doubt, under this influencin' of outcome
Millennium spaceship, totally wasted
Schoolly D classic, though I vocally laced it
Taste this swerve on a regular basis
Servin' y'all whatever the place is
Blowin' connoisseur quality in my competitor's faces
This is without doubt, your lady pass out
This Illa-Fifth Twilight Zone, you ass out
Shout, to my brothers on back route
Whippin' the short that's smacked out, dig it
Strump this in your cassette deck, hip-hop has not left yet
I sent a verse in the mail like, a death threat
The critically acclaimed composer, stand over
Whichever mute minuscule mic holder
You never knew the real before, yo I show ya
You need to make your thoughts more sober, think it over

Take heed y'all, get a little P-5-D y'all
Straight from the town of Phil-ly y'all
But we about to give you what you need y'all
Without a doubt

I'm the ultimate, the rhyme imperial
I'm better but some don't believe though
But I'm a proven hot
Y'all know the legendary Roots crew

Here we go Ock, watch my material knock
Y'all Tonka toys straight out the cereal box
Down low covert ops feel or not
Throw your mitts up we 'bout to thicken the plot

My name is D-you-N-D-S-P, The Mic specialist
Laid back how it come off it seems effortless
I mac Nicholas, like a me St.
Flow excellent, my movement the next testament

Rhinoceros in the raps of far we
Y'all weaklings get slapped at the party
I'm the MC that MC's aspire to be
Back to do it to death til ya tired of me

Now who the number one best
The never pop nothin' sound like the rest
C'mon you know I am em
Raw like dark denim, with a soft spot for smart women,

Green trees and white linen
The black thought was a monster from the beginnin'
Wreak spit venom, raw core shit I pinnin'
It's my time and it's long overdo

Now who's comin through y'all know who

Y'all know the legendary roots crew
Word up Black Th-idought, code name ?
Fake MC's get stuck with pitchforks
From rollerbladin' on thin ice like it's a rink

Picklehead cats is join, they don't think
Ya not sleepin' that a long ass blink money
Ya little chicken thick but her breath stink
Nothin' y'all spittin' is interesting

Y'all not Black Thought, nor the next best thing
Plug bullshit start a kid thuggish
Go ahead get ya thing off son, I just love it
It manifests a style thou shall not covet

And none of y'all rappers want no parts of it 
Who the steppin' razor, like Peter Ti-dosh
My nine speak soft my thoughts is Molotov
You cut like that then fuck it we all can toss

And who gonna shine when all y'all take a loss
It's the boar, it's similar tan as Dice Raw
Its big spawn kids cohap the quick draw
We heavyweight blowin' 'em out the picture

For real, for real
Who comin' to get y'all
Mix
Step into the spot the venue is empty

5 minutes later the crowd is in a frenzy
Packed up to the maximum occupancy
Give me the mic I got a Jones like Quincy
Break down the barriers don't try to fence me

Let the ladies in the front get pressed against me
Peepin', brothers on stage ten deep-an'
24 out the 18 straight leapin'
Duck season, Thought bust the heat seakin'

Mission make y'all feel this and keep leakin'
Bang this in the hoods
Like stolen goods, keep reachin'
New soundwave street sweepin'

I walk upon water like Run D 'em
Cash Money maintainin' the cut
It's our time and it's long overdue
Who comin' through y'all know who

Y'all know the legendary roots crew
Word up Black Th-idought, code name ?

I'm just playin the wall, I'm just playin the wall 
Coolin with my niggaz on the right, hold tight 
Late Friday night strobelight shine bright blind 
Coolin at this party with the sugars on my mind 
It's the sex patrol, the sex patrol 
Yeah the young sis was stacked wicked, wanted me to kick it 
Said I never dance, made advance outside 
Took a glance to expect, Shorty was correct 
So it seemed, her name Shavon, age seventeen 
I flipped when I seen her eyes, bloodshot green 
She said she wanted riches and a nigga with cash 
Lex Land' or a Path', didn't know the half 
I react to flip the script and get ill 
My man Malik be	 kept telling me to relax 
Diggin how you're livin on some unreal high 
As I realize -- you're not that fly 

You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
So go 'head, witcha self 

You ain't fly

Dig it, you see sisters is thinkin that I snooze 
She must don't know, I have a sister confused 
Thinkin that she's pretty and saditty when I spill 
She said, "I might, I think I can, alright I will." 
Tossed up was the digits cause the game is like splendor 
I said, "Sabrina yea, I met you way back in December; you remember." 
She said, "I guess." 
Substitute to Santa, she was sittin on the desk 
And then she said, "You never called me; Mailk you never tried to press. 
You never tried to push the seven buttons and address." 
I said, "Hold up sis -- you're out of order, man you lost it. 
My name ain't Jake; Malik's no Flake that's Frosted." 
Tryin to cause a scene Sabrina's rest is self-redeemed 
She thought she was cute, but never made it on my team 
I should beam up, about-face fall out 
And don'tcha even dare to ask why -- because you're not that fly 

You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
So go 'head, witcha self 

You ain't fly

Mmmmmm strollin in my Pumas down the avenue 
Not tokin on a J, not sippin on a brew 
Saw a soul sister on the streets of five-two 
"MMM, my name's Question, ummmm, who are you?" 
She didn't respond, she didn't respond 
Continue on 
Thought to myself, should of said a little louder 
Bet hurry up before she gets lost in the crowd of 
"Excuse me Miss, excuse me miss" 
"No, I'm not havin it!" I just got dissed 
I didn't get mad, was calm and collect 
I didn't call her bitch, I didn't break her neck 
Start to wonder why the brothers disrespect the cutie 
It's a place of 180's and the high-priced floozie 
As she walked away, man I couldn't deny 
Started lying to myself, man she wasn't that fly 

You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
So go 'head, witcha self 

You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
So go 'head, witcha self 

You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
You ain't fly

Black, butter umm... that's what I be 
Had to tell a girl to set her mind free 
Use the Third Eye possibly you will see 
What you get, with material objects 
Want to be the envy of the whole projects gettin loot 
Pretty in your cute limited Express suit 
Baby I can see everything you want to be 
See you're gamin as a key to escape poverty 
Known to be shown around, sport about her niggaz 
Thinkin you a woman cause your ass got bigger 
Kickin it to me as if I don't know the time 
But I'm the BlackThought, I'm all up in your mind 
I figure you the kind to say, "Give me a call" 
But then switch to act strange, countin on my change 
Pay to the order of who??? Not you 
Why? You're not THAT fly 

You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
So go 'head, witcha self 

You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
So go 'head, witcha self 

You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
So go 'head, witcha self 

You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
You ain't fly 
So go 'head, witcha self

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

Somebody told me that this planet was small
We use to live in the same building on the same floor
And never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour
And peep this Ethiopian queen from Philly
Taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo flash focus record
Said she workin on a flick and
Could my click do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris
At Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage
And took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that
Things fall apart, intentions shatter
She like that shit don't matter
When I get home get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever
Let's link, let's get together
Shit you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot
Time passed, we back in Philly now she up in my spot
Tellin me the things I'm tellin her is makin her hot
Startin buildin with her constantly round the clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop
And keep tellin me

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where

Yo, I'm the type that's always catchin a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some 'ol
Another lonely night
Seems like I'm on the side you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper daddy keep that shit tight
But yo I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me
While politicin with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty
Psych, I'm playin boo, you know it's just wit you I'm stayin boo
And when cats be poppin game I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin to your homies they be leavin you blind

Yeah, so what you sayin I can trust you?
Is you crazy, you my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill
No doubt

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby don't worry you know that you got me

If you were worried 'bout where

Baby don't worry you know that you got me

That snake could be that chick
And that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering "she tryin to play you for the fool Black"
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be I ain't on some "oh I'm a celebrity"
I deal with the real so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to they squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where they whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, she like
