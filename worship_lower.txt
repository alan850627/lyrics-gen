 caught up in your victory.
 
 singing songs of a higher love,
 for you are with me,
 you are with me.
 
 and we are ever praising you!
 you brought a blessing,
 and the blessing was you. 
 
 there was a treasure,
 and the treasure was you! 
 
 before we had nothing, now  we have all things,
 we were all lost but found the truth.
 
 you brought a blessing,
 and the blessing was you.
 
 as i walk through the valley low,
 i will build a place of hope.
 going on from strength to strength,
 for you are in me,
 you are in me.
 
 looking up to you with hope,
 from the one that walks away.
 give it all for just one day that you are with me,

 we have nothing to offer you
 which you did not provide
 every good, perfect gift comes from
 your kind and gracious heart
 and all we do is give back to you
 what always has been yours
 
 lord, we're breathing the breath
 that you gave us to breath
 to worship you, to worship you
 and we're singing these songs
 with the very same breath
 to worship you, to worship you
 
 who has given to you
 that it should be paid back to him?
 who has given to you
 as if you needed anything?
 from you, and to you, and through you
 come all things, o lord
 and all we do is give back to you
 what always has been yours
 
 we are breathing the breath
 that you gave us to breath
 
 
 verse 1
 your mercy taught us how to dance
 to celebrate with all we have
 and we'll dance to thank you for mercy
 your glory taught us how to shout
 we'll lift your name in all the earth
 and we'll shout to the praise of your glory
 
 pre-chorus
 it's the overflow of a forgiven soul
 and now we've seen you, god
 our hearts cannot stay silent
 
 chorus
 and we'll be a dancing generation
 dancing because of your great mercy, lord
 your great mercy, lord
 and we'll be a shouting generation
 shouting because of your great glory, lord
 your great glory, lord

 in whatever worldly state thou would have me be
 not from sorrow, pain or care, freedom dare i claim
 this alone shall be my prayer, glorify thy name

 let my glad heart, while it sings, there in all proclaim
 and, whate'er the future brings, glorify thy name
 
 chorus:
 be glorified in me, be glorified
 be glorified in me, be glorified

 loving kindness as the flood
 when the prince of life, our ransom
 shed for us his precious blood
 who his love will not remember?
 who can cease to sing his praise?
 he can never be forgotten
 throughout heaven's eternal days
 
 on the mount of crucifixion
 fountains opened deep and wide
 through the floodgates of god's mercy
 flowed a vast and gracious tide
 grace and love, like mighty rivers
 poured incessant from above
 and heaven's peace and perfect justice
 kissed a guilty world in love
 
 no love is higher, no love is wider
 no love is deeper, no love is truer
 no lover is higher, no lover is wider
 no love is like your love, o lord

 1. when the music fades
 all is stripped away,
 and i simply come
 longing just to bring
 something that's of worth
 that will bless your heart
 
 bridge:
 i'll bring you more than a song, for a song in itself
 is not what you have required
 you search much deeper within through the way things appear
 you're looking into my heart
 
 chorus:
 i'm coming back to the heart of worship
 and it's all about you, all about you, jesus
 i'm sorry, lord, for the thing i've made it
 when it's all about you, all about you, jesus
 
 2. king of endless worth
 no one could express how much you deserve
 though i'm weak and poor
 all i have is yours, ev'ry single breath
 
 
 
 
 
 when i survey the wondrous cross
 on which the prince of glory died
 my richest gain, i count but loss
 and pour contempt on all my pride
 
 see from his head, his hands, his feet
 sorrow and love flow mingled down
 did ever such love and sorrow meet?
 or thorns compose, so rich a crown
 
 oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
 bids me come and die and find that i may truly live
 oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
 all who gather here by grace, draw near and bless your name
 
 were the whole realm of nature mine
 that were an offering far too small
 love so amazing, so divine
 demands my soul, my life, my all
 
 oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
 bids me come and die and find that i may truly live
 oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
 all who gather here by grace, draw near and bless your name
 
 oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
 bids me come and die and find that i may truly live
 
 love so amazing, so divine
 demands my soul, my life, my all
 
 it's the beauty and the shame
 it's the glory and the name
 wonderful cross
 
 oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
 bids me come and die and find that i may truly live
 oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
 all who gather here by grace, draw near and bless your name
 
 oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
 bids me come and die and find that i may truly live

 i was throwin' away what i needed most
 it was the father, son and the holy ghost
 a little carnal knowledge is a dangerous thing
 it'll eat a hole in the brain
 i'd be the biggest fool in the whole universe
 to trade a heavenly blessing for a worldly curse
 i was a weaker man 'til i made my stand
 now i am here to make a change
 
 
 i'm running blind on the wheels of faith
  moving to the beat of a heart that prays
  hangin' on every word you said
 i get a little stronger every day
 
 ain't ganna find any help on the t.v.
 or written down on the pages of people magazine
 it takes digging a little deeper into the good book now
 for a little sacred advice...oh yah
 
 
 
 
 gettin' strong, a stronger now, every day
 gettin' strong, a stronger now, every day
 i'm getting stronger
 
 
 
 
 can you hear, there's a new song
 breaking out from the children of freedom
 every race and every nation
 sing it out sing a new hallelujah

 the wind is moving
 but i am standing still
 a life of pages
 waiting to be filled
 a heart that's hopeful
 a head that's full of dreams
 but this becoming
 is harder than it seems
 feels like i'm
 
 looking for a reason
 roaming through the night to find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 not a lot to lean on
 i need your light to help me find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 
 if there are millions
 down on their knees
 among the many
 can you still hear me?
 hear me asking
 where do i belong?
 is there a vision
 that i can call my own?
 show me i'm
 
 looking for a reason
 roaming through the night to find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 not a lot to lean on
 i need your light to help me find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 
 looking for a reason
 roaming through the night to find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 not a lot to lean on
 i need your light to help me find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 
 looking for a reason
 roaming through the night to find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 
 
 caught in a dream of where i want to be
 wrapped in a web of where i am
 i feel a wall between what is and what should be
 you find me waiting for a miracle
 you hear me praying for a plan
 you are the only one prepared to rescue me
 
 
 then you take away the distance
 found between the truth and me
 and you give a simple reason to my restless rhyme
 whoa, hide me in the heaven
 you have held within your hand
 and make a way to find a way to soothe my mind
 
 there is a way that might seem right to me
 a dim reflection of what's good
 just an illusion of the best that i can be
 but there's another path you offer me
 i wish i always understood
 some way you see right through my thoughts
 and know my needs

 'til i'm breaking a sweat
 'til i never forget
 your calling
 keep me on the line
 give me the nerve
 here it's all in the serve
 
 locked in the diamond lane
 i kept driving past it
 better to be safe than learn
 what you're about
 give me another chance
 to go where you're going now
 i'm here to walk it out
 i'm here to walk it out
 i'm here to walk it out
 
 
 
 it's all in the serve

 this christmas season i wish you joy
 the wonder in every girl and boy
 i wish you gladness, the one 
 have good friends and family gathered near
 
 may children's laughter in falling snow
 rekindle those sweet scenes from long ago
 may every carol, each candle bright
 remind you why angels sang that night
 
 if trouble finds you, this is my prayer
 may peace come into your hearts and make you strong
 and i wish you luck, the kind to last all year long
 
 
 
 it's over the line, a shadow of doubt
 from outside looking at the "in crowd"
 
 they look mighty fine, a sight to behold
 but all that glitters is not gold
 
 
 
 all you're missin' is a heartache
 a disillusion for a keepsake
 a life of living with your own mistake
 all you're missin' is a heartache
 
 the water is high, you're out on a limb
 well, if you take the fall then it's "sink or swim"
 
 you're kissing the dark
 you're courting your pride
 you wonder is it greener on the other side
 
 
 
 
 all you're missin', missin' is a heartache
 all you're missin', missin' is a heartache
 whoa whoa whoa whoa
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 amazing grace
 how sweet the sound
 that saved a wretch like me
 i once was lost, but now i'm found
 was blind, but now i see
 
 'twas grace that taught my heart to fear
 and grace my fears relieved
 how precious did that grace appear
 the hour i first believed
 
 
 my chains are gone
 i've been set free
 my god, my savior has ransomed me
 and like a flood his mercy rains
 unending love, amazing grace
 
 the lord has promised good to me
 his word my hope secures
 he will my shield and portion be
 as long as life endures
 
 
 
 the earth shall soon dissolve like snow
 the sun forbear to shine
 but god, who called me here below
 will be forever mine
 will be forever mine
 you are forever mine
 
 
 
 amazing love, amazing grace
 amazing love, amazing grace
 
 
 holy words long preserved
 for our walk in this world,
 they resound with god's own heart
 oh, let the ancient words impart.
 
 words of life, words of hope

 jack is in the corner
 the dish is with the spoon
 the sheep is in the meadow
 the cow is on the moon
 but i am here with you and i believe
 there's no other place i'd rather be
 and a promise not to leave you
 is a promise i can keep
 
 you're my muse
 you're my rhyme
 you're the fire warming this heart of mine
 when you hear me say "i love you"
 anna, do you know how much i do?
 
 so i watch you from a distance
 getting lost within your world
 you pretend to be a princess
 as you flutter and you twirl
 fragile as the flower in your hair
 dancing in your castle, unaware
 that a single day without you
 would be more than i could bear
 
 little anna, little star
 that is what you really are
 cross my heart and hope to die
 you're the apple of my eye
 
 
 in the space of the beginning
 was the living word of light
 when this word was clearly spoken
 all that came to be was right
 all creation had a language
 words to say what must be said
 all day long the heavens whispered
 signing words in scarlet red
 
 some failed to understand it
 so god spoke his final word
 on a silent night in judah's
 hills a baby's cry was heard
 
 "glory!" sang the angel chorus
 "glory!" echoed back the night
 love has come to walk among us
 christ the lord is born this night
 
 all creation sing his praises
 earth and heaven praise his name
 all who live come join the chorus
 find the words his love proclaim
 
 find the words his love proclaim
 
 
 our father, which art in heaven
 hallowed be thy name
 our father, which art in heaven
 hallowed be thy name
 
 thy kingdom come
 thy will be done
 on earth as it is in heaven
 
 our father, which art in heaven
 hallowed be thy name
 hallowed be thy name
 
 our father, which art in heaven
 our father
 hallowed be thy name
 hallowed be thy name
 
 thy kingdom come
 thy will be done

 give us this day
 our daily bread
 and forgive us our debts
 as we forgive our debtors
 
 our father, which art in heaven
 hallowed be thy name
 
 our father, which art in heaven
 hallowed be thy name
 
 and lead us not into temptation
 but deliver us, deliver us from evil
 
 for thine is the kingdom, and all the power
 and the glory
 forever amen
 
 our father, which art in heaven
 hallowed be thy name
 thy kingdom come
 thy will be done
 on earth as it is in heaven

 wasn't it long ago
 wasn't it on a new england coast
 wasn't it the standard - people praying to
 the son and the father and the holy ghost
 one nation over god
 is that what we've now become?
 the founding fathers left a noble legacy
 to their sons and daughters
 to their sons and daughters
 look at what we've done
 look at what we've done
 
 chorus:
 breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
 as we learn to bite the hand
 that tries to feed us
 breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
 if we say that we are free
 who will believe us
 if we breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
 breakdown, break
 
 see the powder on the glass
 see the pillow on the street
 see the charter of a modern love
 with no obligations...or promises to meet
 
 hear the fear of disease
 hear the baby never born
 hear a people crying out
 "somebody save us - oh, please somebody save us
 from what we're headed for - from what we're headed for"

 from what we're headed for - from what we're headed for"
 
 
 
 breakdown, breakdown, breakdown
 as we learn to bite the hand
 that tries to feed us
 breakdown, breakdown, breakdown

 calling heaven
 seeking mercy
 tell me there's a place for these
 what of the children who have never felt a love
 tender as the morning
 nursing the bruises
 and the scars that never seem to go away
 
 what of the babies who have never left the womb
 breathing in the lifeline
 angels in waiting
 gone before they could be given wings to fly
 
 
 
 what of the noble who are searching for the truth
 with truest of intentions
 and yet they're jaded by
 hypocrisies behind cathedral walls
 
 what of the humble and the meek that knew despair
 and never got their moment
 but sacrificed a life of comfort
 so that others knew no pain
 
  
 
 what of the ones who call you lord
 but play the field
 with faithless indecision
 forgive us father for we truly
 do not know what we have done

 loved ones close to our hearts
 and strangers in lands afar
 together share in the joy
 emmanuel
 he has come to dwell
 with one voice
 let the world rejoice
 
 
 there's not a world of difference
 out in the world tonight
 between this world of people
 red, yellow, black and white
 but instead of riding a rainbow of love
 we still are fighting with prejudice gloves
 of anger
 with something to claim
 but nothing to gain so
 
 why can't we be color blind
 you know we should
 be living together
 and we'd find a reason and rhyme
 i know we would
 cause we could see better
 if we could be color blind
 
 somebody's just assuming
 he's up to nothing good
 cause he's not like the others
 there goes the neighborhood
 what kind of world are we living in
 when we judge a man by the tone of his skin
 it's crazy
 cause he has a heart
 like you have a heart and
 
 why can't we be color blind
 you know we should
 be living together
 and we'd find a reason and rhyme
 i know we would
 cause we could see better
 if we could be color blind
 
 it'd be so fine
 to be color blind
 to open our eyes
 and see color blind
 
 i know this world would be a better place
 the only race would be the human race
 all of those barriers would be erased
 why can't we be color blind
 
 why can't we be color blind
 you know we should
 be living together
 and we'd find a reason and rhyme
 i know we would
 cause we could see better
 if we could be color blind

 been here for days 
 i'm amazed at this teacher 
 carpenter, preacher
 lost in the crowd, i hear him now 
 he's praying and he's saying, god feed them all
 five thousand men, all of his friends
 are worried find bread and hurry
 five loaves and fish, what can he wish
 he's praying still he's saying, god feed them all
 
 could he be the messiah
 miracle man, part of the plan
 could he be the messiah
 life in his hand
 i understand he could be
 
 meet for our needs fully 
 he feeds our hunger older and younger
 twelve baskets more, can we ignore 
 he shows us that he knows us, is he the christ
 god in his eyes, i realize his power, need of the hour
 jesus is his name, they say he came to feed us 
 and to receive us, is he the christ
 
 could he be the messiah
 miracle man, part of the plan
 could he be the messiah
 life in his hand
 i understand he could be
 
 it is he the messiah
 miracle man, part of the plan
 it is he the messiah
 life in his hand
 i understand it is he
 
 could he be the messiah
 miracle man, part of the plan
 could he be the messiah
 life in his hand
 i understand he could be
 
 
 in the darkness and in the flood
 you're there with me, you're there with
 and in the desert and in the sun
 you're holdin' me, you're holdin' me, yeah
 
 you cover me with your love
 you cover me with, you cover me with your love

 when my strength is faltering
 you carry me, you carry me

 ink and paper, epic offers
 glass moon waltzing on the waters
 horse and carriage
 i am courting the marriage
 of dreams in the wings
 of visions unseen
 
 
 cross my heart
 only your love will do
 cross my heart over you
 cross my heart
 there is room enough for two
 cross my heart over you, over you
 
 inside, feels like there's a thunder
 spellbound, you've take me under
 gold and diamond
 ever saying that i'm in this forevermore
 you can be sure
 
 
 
 
 where do you stand
 what is your statement
 what is it you're trying to say
 what's in your hand
 what's in your basement
 what's in the cards you don't play
 are you holding the key
 or are you intending
 to pick the lock of heaven's gate
 it's confusing to me
 the message you're sending
 and i don't know if i can relate
 
 what's you line
 tell me why you wear your cross of gold
 state of mind
 or does it find a way into your soul
 
 is it a flame
 is it a passion
 a symbol of love living in you
 or is it a game
 religion in fashion
 some kind of phase you're going through
 we all travel the extremes
 from cellar to rafter
 looking for a place in the sun
 so i'm trying to see
 what you're headed after
 but i don't know where you're coming from
 
 for some it's simply something 
 to wear around your neck
 just a chain
 jewelry
 is it decoration
 is it an icon
 or proclamation
 an icon of what
 what
 for some it's simply something 
 to wear around your neck
 just a chain
 it means a lot more than that to me
 
 what's you line
 tell me why you wear your cross of gold
 state of mind
 or does it find a way into your soul
 
 
 crown him with many crowns,
 the lamb upon the throne:
 hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns
 all music but its own!
 awake, my soul, and sing
 of him who died for thee,
 and hail him as thy matchless king
 through all eternity.
 crown him with many crowns
 crown him with many crowns
 
 crown him the lord of heav'n:
 one with the father known.
 one with the spirit through him giv'n
 from yonder glorious throne.
 to thee be endless praise.
 for thou hast died for me;
 be thou, o lord, through endless days
 adored and magnified
 
 adored and magnified
 crown him with many crowns
 
 his glories now we sing,
 who died and rose on high,
 who died eternal life to bring
 and, lives that death may die.
 
 crown him with many crowns
 
 
 my life is like a racing car hurtling towards the wall
 at the speed of sound
 my time has been so finely tuned
 but i've never seen a human being so tightly wound
 at times it seems beyond belief
 i just need a bit of relief
 like a war-weary soldier
 marching up and over the edge
 take my hand and pull me up cause i'm falling too fast
 somehow i've lost my way - i'm cryin' save me
 
 chorus
 can you hear me...i'm calling out
 i'm crying out...a cry for love
 i can feel you...you're touching me
 you healing me...my cry for love
 
 i will be the first to admit
 i don't have the strength to handle it alone anymore
 i don't have to fret, don't have to explain
 all my worrying's in vain
 i'm not alone anymore
 
 why is this so hard to believe
 what is mine is mine to freely receive
 like the changing of seasons
 this is the beauty of the word
 and for all that i have seen and heard
 oh i want to come home
 somehow i'll make my way - my way home to you
 
 chorus
 
 bridge:
 oh father hear my call 
 i know you'll catch me when i fall
 oh father hear my call 
 i know you'll catch me when i fall
 oh i pray that you'll hold me now
 hold me
 and take my fear away
 
 i'm cryin' save me
 oh i know that you can hear me
 hear me crying out for love
 oh i know that you can feel my cry for love...ooh...
 
 i can feel you - you're calling out
 you're crying out - a cry for love
 i can feel you - you're touching me 
 you're healing me - my cry for love
 
 
 
 
 
 sitting at your feet is where i want to be
 i'm home when i am here with you
 ruined by your grace, enamored by your gaze
 i can't resist the tenderness in you
 
 i'm deep in love with you, abba father
 i'm deep in love with you, lord
 my heart, it beats for you, precious jesus
 i'm deep in love with you lord
 
 humbled and amazed that you would call my name
 i never have to search again
 there's a deep desire that's burning like a fire
 to know you as my closest friend
 
 lord, my redeemer, your blood runs through my veins
 my love for you is deeper than it was yesterday
 i enter through the curtain, parted by your grace
 oh, your the lover of my soul
 
 
 dreams within the still of night
 on wings of hope take flight inside of me
 there upon some distant shore
 we want for nothing more than what will be
 and you and i, here we are
 i wonder as we've come this far
 
 if i could only read your mind
 tell me the answer i would find
 do you dream of me?
 and when you're smiling in your sleep
 beyond the promises we keep
 do you dream of me?
 
 love has found a magic space
 a deep and hidden place where time stands still
 now i hold you in my arms
 you know you hold my heart and always will
 
 and you and i, here we are
 and it's a wonder that we've come this far.
 
 and after all that we've been through
 you've leaned on me, i've leaned on you
 do you dream of me?
 and when you're smiling in your sleep
 beyond the promises we keep
 do you dream of me?
 
 if i could only read your mind
 tell me the answer i would find
 do you dream of me?
 and when you're smiling in your sleep
 beyond the promises we keep
 do you dream of me?
 and after all that we've been through
 you've leaned on me, i've leaned on you.
 do you dream of me?

 do you dream of me?
 
 
 i remember when you took a stand
 with the pearl of wisdom in your hand
 and a soul of desire
 you hold your own up against the world
 a lion's heart in a little girl
 so unafraid of the fire
 
 but those days don't last
 sweet dreams die fast
 a stumble when you walk on the wire
 when all your friends
 start giving in
 the flames are burning higher and higher
 
 
 don't give up, andrea
 got the whole world at your feet
 just keep on holding on
 this is where you need to be
 
 all the days that you've been spending
 spinning while your heart's descending
 like a stone in the ocean
 sometimes when you think the world is ending
 it's really just a new beginning
 the other side of emotion
 
 but i've seen your eyes
 no compromise
 when you set your mind on the matter
 be strong through the tears
 and your sight will clear
 you're gonna get what you're after
 
 
 
 don't be surprised when the road divides
 just take the one less traveled by
 
 
 
 
 draw me close to you
 never let me go
 i lay it all down again
 to hear you say that i'm your friend
 you are my desire
 no one else will do
 'cause nothing else can take your place

 in the shadow of love
 
 
 caught, in an endless time
 waiting for a sign
 to show you where to go
 lost, in a silent stare
 looking anywhere
 for answers you don't know
 
 
 on the wire
 balancing your dreams
 hoping ends will meet their means
 you feel alone
 uninspired
 well does it help you to
 know that i believe in you
 you're an angel waiting for wings...emily
 
 you, going through this stage
 it's a restless age
 young and insecure
 sill, there are doubts to fade
 moments to be made
 and one of them is yours
 
 
 
 on the wire
 balancing your dreams
 hoping ends will meet their means
 but you feel alone
 uninspired
 oh does it help you to
 know that i believe in you
 you're an angel waiting for wings
 oh, you're an angel waiting for wings...emily
 
 
 emmanuel, emmanuel
 emmanuel, emmanuel
 wonderful counsellor
 lord of life, lord of all
 he is the prince of peace,
 mighty god, holy one
 emmanuel, emmanuel
 
 
 on the day
 you were saved
 heaven and hell marked you down
 angels praise
 devils raged
 life became a battleground
 so when hell starts to move
 and the enemy marches on you
 hang on, it's a fight
 you've been marked by the army of night
 you're a target
 
 when your heart
 loved the dark
 hell could just leave you alone
 with your life
 filled with light
 you have become quite a foe
 
 so when hell starts to move
 and the enemy marches on you
 hang on, it's a fight
 it's a battle of darkness and light
 
 
 when things get bad and you can't stand to look
 it's time to read to the end of the book
 don't put it down 'til you get to the end
 when jesus come and his kingdom begins
 'til he comes
 god the son
 teaches us to use the sword
 and every fight
 has a light
 when you know we win the war
 
 so when hell starts to move
 and the enemy marches on you
 hang on, it's a fight
 you're a part of the army of light
 
 
 
 
 it's like staring at the sky above
 when i look in your eyes
 now where in the world did you come from?
 you're so beautiful and i know
 
 oh, i can't escape your love
 escape your love, escape your love
 i can't escape your love
 escape your love, escape your love
 
 every time i turn around you're there
 i get a feeling that won't go away
 nothing else in this whole world compares
 you're surrounding me and i know
 
 that i can't escape your love
 escape your love, escape your love
 i can't escape your love
 escape your love, escape your love
 
 and in the righteous crowd
 your face is all i see
 i hope you know by now
 that i just can't escape, yeah
 
 oh, i can't escape your love
 escape your love, escape your love
 oh, i can't escape your love
 escape your love, escape your love
 
 oh, i can't escape your love
 escape your love, escape your love, oh yeah, yeah
 
 
 
 
 
 
 the longing in my heart has stirred a faded memory
 of my young heart beating fast behind the willow tree
 i was counting out loud, and i only peeked a time or two
 and the only purpose in my life was finding you
 singing, "ollie, ollie, everybody free!"
 now was i chasing you or were you chasing me?
 
 we all grow up and put away our childhood games
 but deep inside i wonder if we really change
 'cause i'm still seeking, though i've learned to hide so well
 and i can still remember how it felt
 singing, "ollie, ollie, everybody free!"
 will i ever find someone pursuing me?
 
 and then you caught me by surprise
 i found my tears are in your eyes
 i hear my heart inside of you
 at last i've found somebody who
 can free my soul
 and love me too
 
 i can't believe we hide so long and run so well
 when all the while we're aching to be caught and held
 but it's only in surrender that our freedom comes
 and so i run abandoned to your waiting arms
 singing "ollie, ollie, everybody free!"
 i belong to you and you belong to me!
 
 singin' "ollie, ollie, everybody free
 
 
 darkness thick and heavy,
 black and steady screaming darkness
 anyone who hates his brother,
 who plans evil for another
 walks in darkness
 sonlight, warm and shining,
 purifying, welcome sonlight
 everyone who loves completely
 with a heart that opens freely
 walks in sonlight
 
 
 let us love in the light
 for love is from god
 if we love what is right
 we show whose we are
 in a world of the dying
 we're living our parts
 if we love in the light
 with all of our hearts
 
 blindness, terrifying, left for dying, spirit blindness
 anyone who thirsts for evil plots
 his very own upheaval
 lost in blindness
 new sight, truth unending, faith unbending, new sight
 everyone who seeks the father leaves the world
 and all it's bother
 sees with new sight
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fly to the moon

 sittin' in the rain
 water on your brain
 got a hole in your boat
 trying to stay afloat
 has got you down
 i've got a wind in my sail
 rubber boots and a pail
 i'll throw you a line
 rest assured that i
 won't ever let you drown
 
 
 cause when you're up against the wall
 you know i'll be here for you, for you
 when you rise and when you fall
 i'll always be here for you, for you
 
 when the plans you make
 fall through and take you
 for a loop
 or some bird has flown the coop
 and left you stranded
 just lean on me
 and together you see
 we'll carry the load
 even if we don't
 quite understand it

 packing up the dreams god planted
 in the fertile soil of you
 can't believe the hopes he's granted
 means a chapter in your life is through
 but we'll keep you close as always
 it won't even seem you've gone
 'cause our hearts in big and small ways
 will keep the love that keeps us strong
 
 and friends are friends forever
 if the lord's the lord of them
 and a friend will not say never
 'cause the welcome will not end
 though it's hard to let you go
 in the father's hands we know
 that a lifetime's not too long
 to live as friends
 
 with the faith and love god's given
 springing from the hope we know
 we will pray the joy you'll live in
 is the strength that now you show
 but we'll keep you close as always
 it won't even seem you've gone
 'cause our hearts in big and small ways
 will keep the love that keeps us strong
 
 and friends are friends forever
 if the lord's the lord of them
 and a friend will not say never

 no, a lifetime's not too long

 she asked him for forever
 and a promise that would last
 he said, babe you know i love you
 but i can't commit to that
 she said, love isn't love
 'till you give it away
 
 a father lived in silence
 saw his son become a man
 there was a distance felt between them
 'cause he could not understand
 that love isn't love
 'till you give it away
 you gotta give it away
 
 as we live
 moving side by side
 may we learn to give
 learn to sacrifice
 
 we can entertain compassion
 for a world in need of care
 but the road of good intentions
 doesn't lead to anywhere
 cause love isn't love
 'till you give it away
 you gotta give it away
 
 as we live
 moving side by side
 may we learn to give
 learn to sacrifice
 
 love is like a river
 flowing down from the giver of life
 we drink from the water
 and our thirst is no longer denied
 you gotta give it away
 
 as we live
 moving side by side
 may we learn to give
 learn to sacrifice
 
 there was a man who walked on water
 he came to set the people free
 he was the ultimate example
 of what love can truly be
 'cause his love was his life
 and he gave it away
 you gotta give it away
 
 as we live
 moving side by side
 may we learn to give
 learn to sacrifice
 
 
 angels we have heard on high
 sweetly singing o'er the pains
 and the mountains in reply
 echo back their joyous strains
 gloria o gloria in excelsis deo
 
 come to bethlehem and see
 
 him whose birth the angels sing
 
 come adore on bended knee
 christ the lord the newborn king
 
 gloria o gloria in excelsis deo
 
 angels we have heard on high
 
 sweetly singing o'er the plains
 
 jesus lord of heav'n and earth
 with us sing our savior's birth
 
 gloria o gloria in excelsis deo
 
 alleluia
 
 
 i'm blazing a trail that leads to vice
 so easily enticed
 by darker means
 when out of the wilderness of choice
 i hear that one still voice
 call to me
 
 
 go west young man
 go west young man
 when the evil go east
 go west young man
 go west young man
 find a heart that's golden
 
 why must i wander like a cloud
 following the crowd
 well i don't know
 but i'm asking for the will to fight
 to wear the crown of life
 and you say go
 
 
 
 the mind is weak the heart is frail
 when it goes beyond the pale
 so unwise
 
 
 
 
 actions have been justified
 all is compromised
 looking for approval there
 in someone else's eyes, oh
 dodging all you really are
 becomes your greatest task
 acting out your lonely part
 you hide behind your mask
 
 never true to yourself
 knowing well this is not like you
 fooling yourself
 you're just living a lie
 
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 
 victim of the circumstance
 prisoner of the shame
 but it's the double standard life
 that keeps you in the game
 taken by your own disguise
 but when it's wearing thin
 you'll do anything it takes
 to impress your friends
 
 never true to yourself
 knowing well this is not like you
 fooling yourself
 you're just living a lie
 
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 
 never true to yourself
 knowing well this is not like you
 fooling yourself
 you're just living a lie
 
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 goin' goin'
 goin' through the motions
 
 
 i was lost when you found me here
 you pulled me close and held me near
 and i'm a fool but still you love
 i'll be your fool for the king of love
 
 he gave me wings so i could fly
 and gave me a song to color the sky
 and all i have is all from you
 and all i want is all of you
 
 it's grace, grace
 i'm nothing without you
 grace, your grace
 shines on me
 
 and there've been days when i've walked away
 too much to carry
 nothing left to say
 forgive me lord when i'm weak and lost
 you traded heaven for a wooden cross
 
 and all these years you've carried me
 you've been my eyes when i could not see
 and beauty grows in the driving rain
 your ode of gladness in the times of pain
 
 it's grace, your grace
 i'm nothing without you
 grace, your grace
 shines on me
 
 your grace, your grace
 i'm nothing without you
 grace, your grace
 shines on me, oh yeah
 
 shines on me
 shines on me
 i'm everything with you
 shines on me
 shines on me
 it's your grace
 shines on me
 your grace, oh
 
 your grace it shines on me
 your grace
 your grace
 shines on me
 shines on me
 your grace it shines on me
 your grace
 it shines on me
 
 
 just to rest in your arms
 close enough to hear your heart
 just to kneel at your feet
 where everything fades away and i sing
 
 jesus, jesus, take me over now
 i surrender
 everything i have, i lay it down
 all of me
 
 with just a glimpse of your face
 all my fears melt away
 lost within your embrace
 i'm pouring out all my admiration

 providence, providence
 see it laying down the cornerstone
 the hand of providence, it's evident
 for we could never make it on our own
 apportioning the power
 weighing all that it entails
 giving us the fulcrum
 and a balance to the scales
 
 oh, the hand of providence
 is guiding us through choices that we make
 oh, the hand of providence
 is reaching out to help us on our way
 
 providence, ever since
 any thesis ever entered man
 the hand of providence
 has been our best defense
 tho' his ways are sometimes hard to understand
 from the dying of a heartbeat
 to another soul reborn
 from in between and circling
 our thoughts of love and war
 
 oh, the hand of providence
 is guiding us through choices that we make
 oh, the hand of providence
 is reaching out to help us on our way
 
 
 let the tempest and the flood

 can you hear me,
 i'm gonna say it again
 hang on, hang on
 never giving up, no, never giving in
 
 hang on every hopeful word
 even when it seems absurd
 keep holdin' on
 if you triumph when you fail
 keep your head when you prevail
 be a hero
 keep hangin' around
 
 hang on, hang on
 are you listening,
 let me say it again
 hang on, hang on
 never giving up, no,
 never giving in

 is a homecoming christmas
 with the snow fluttering down 'til the world seems new
 
 
 bright candles burning
 old friends returning
 the wishes of children coming true
 and the happiest wishes are just old fashioned wishes
 may your days be merry, your sorrows be small
 may the ones you love be near you
 that's the happiest christmas of all
 
 repeat chorus

 righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne
 a fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side
 his lightning lights up the world
 the earth sees and trembles
 the mountains melt like wax before the lord
 before the lord of all the earth
 the heavens proclaim his righteousness
 and all peoples will see his glory
 
 we want to see your glory, god
 do you want to see his glory
 lift your voices, lift your hands
 
 let it rain, let it rain.
 open the floodgates of heaven
 let it rain, let it rain.
 open the floodgates of heaven
 
 
 when the music fades
 all is stripped away
 and i simply come
 longing just to bring
 something that's of worth
 that will bless your heart
 i'll bring you more than a song
 for a song in itself
 is not what you have required
 you search much deeper within
 through the way things appear
 you're looking into my heart
 
 i'm coming back to the heart of worship
 and it's all about you,
 it's all about you, jesus
 i'm sorry, lord, for the thing i've made it
 when it's all about you,
 it's all about you, jesus
 
 king of endless worth
 no one could express
 how much you deserve
 though i'm weak and poor
 all i have is yours
 every single breath
 i'll bring you more than a song
 for a song in itself
 is not what you have required
 you search much deeper within
 through the way things appear
 you're looking into my heart
 
 i'm coming back to the heart of worship
 and it's all about you,
 it's all about you, jesus
 i'm sorry, lord, for the thing i've made it
 and it's all about you,
 it's all about you, jesus

 and it's all about you,
 it's all about you, jesus
 i'm sorry, lord, for the thing i've made it
 and it's all about you,
 it's all about you, jesus
 
 it's all about you
 it's all about you
 it's all about you
 it's all about you
 it's all about you
 it's all about you
 
 it's all about you
 it's all about you
 it's all about you
 it's all about you
 
 i'm coming back to the heart of worship
 and it's all about you,
 it's all about you, jesus
 i'm sorry, lord, for the thing i've made it
 and it's all about you,
 it's all about you, jesus
 
 
 where's the navigator of your destiny?
 where is the dealer of this hand?
 who can explain life and its brevity
 cause there is nothing here that i can understand
 
 you and i have barely met
 and i just don't want to let go of you yet
 
 
 noah, hello, goodbye
 i will see you on the other side
 noah, sweet child of mine
 i will see you on the other side
 
 and so i hold your tiny hand in mine
 for the hardest thing i've ever had to face
 heaven calls for you before it calls for me
 when you get there, save me a place
 
 a place where i can share your smile
 and i can hold you for more than just a while
 
 
 
 
 people say that time will heal 
 but you know, they just don't feel what you feel 
 times are hard but god is so good 
 he's never failed you, and he said he never would 
 
 he see's your tears 
 he fights your fears 
 
 hold on, help is on the way 
 he said he'd never leave you or forsake you 
 stay strong 
 help is on the way 
 he'd said he'd help you 
 just reach out and take his hand 
 
 he knows your heart, he lifts your head 
 he's always close enough to hear every word you said 
 when you're weak, he said he's so much more 
 his arm is long enough to reach you where you are 
 
 he see's your tears 
 he fights your fears 
 
 hold on, help is on the way 
 he said he'd never leave you or forsake you 
 stay strong 
 help is on the way 
 he'd said he'd help you 
 just reach out and take his hand 
 
 hold on, help is on the way 
 he said he'd never leave you or forsake you 
 stay strong 
 help is on the way 
 he'd said he'd help you 
 just reach out and take his hand 
 
 help is on the way
 help is on the way
 help is on the way
 help is on the way
 help is on the way
 help is on the way
 help is on the way
 help is on the way
 help is on the way
 
 
 it can be wise
 or it can be a paradox
 to seek solace in your solitude
 and when it feels
 like you're living in a box
 you need someone who believes in you
 a promise true when tried
 i'll be right here by your side
 so whenever your need be
 know that you can lean on me
 
 chorus:
 i'll help you find your way
 i'll help you find your way
 when you're lost in all the madness
 when you're blinded by your doubt
 when you need someone to be there for you
 i'll help you find your way
 
 don't keep your thoughts
 locked behind your cellar door
 all shrouded in a mystery
 just let them out
 that's what friends are for
 to give without giving the "third degree"
 no need to be ashamed
 i've been through' it just the same
 so when your path misleads
 know that you can call on me
 
 
 
 
 there's a place where i can go
 where the angels hear me pray
 "i want to change
 yes i need your touch"
 i'm waiting here for you
 
 and i fall, at your feet
 i'll give it all, until the day we meet
 here i am
 ready to give up my life for the one
 ready to pour out my heart for the son
 here i am
 
 here i come to your threshing floor
 where the angels fear to tread
 i'm waiting here for the king of love
 and to hold the hands that bled
 
 and i fall, at your feet
 i'll give it all, until the day we meet
 
 
 here i am
 ready to give up my life for the one
 ready to pour out my heart for the son
 
 
 light of the world
 you stepped down into darkness
 open my eyes
 let me see
 beauty that made
 this heart adore you
 hope of a life
 spent with you

 hey you
 things to do
 live the life for faith and family
 it's tough
 with all that stuff
 filling your head
 we know
 the undertow
 could get us so we don't remember, but
 lest we ever
 lest we ever forget
 
 hey you, it's me
 true lovers are we
 children under the sun
 two spirits in the name of one
 
 hey me
 got to be
 places to go and people there to see
 no space
 for back to base
 and no time at all
 we talk
 walk the walk
 run the race
 and climb the ladder, but
 if we ever
 if we ever should fall
 
 sometimes the smoke clears
 and i see things how they are
 i see how we have come so far
 
 
 
 
 
 hallelujah, hallelujah, for our lord god almighty reign
 hallelujah, hallelujah, for our lord god almighty reign
 hallelujah, holy, holy 
 are you lord god almighty

  how long will we grovel at the feet of wealth and power
  how long will we bow down to that golden calf
 how long will be too long
  how long will we curtsy to the whims of new religion
 how long will we water down the truth
 'til truth is no more
 how long will be too long
 
 
 the power of faith and love
 can change the stuff we're made of
 but still we wait
  how long will be too long
 
  how long will we drink from the chalice of indifference
 neither be hot or be cold
 can a sober soul know
 how long will be too long
 
 
 
 is there not more to us
 than cursed dust to dust
 i feel my hope fading
 how long will be too long
 
 how long will be too long
 
  how long will we travel from the ways that god intended
 won't it all tumble down if his holy wrath comes
 how long will be too long
 
 
 
 the power of faith and love
 can change the stuff we're made of
 when will it be too late
 how long will be too long
 how long will be too long
 how long will be too long
 
 
 tell me when the time we had slipped away
 tomorrow turned to yesterday and i don't know how
 
 tell me what can stop this river of tears
 it's been building up for years for this moment now
 
 here i stand arms open wide
 i've held you close, kept you safe
 till you could fly
 
 tell me where the road ahead is gonna bend
 and how to harness up the wind and how to say goodbye
 
 tell me why does following your dreams
 take you far away from me and i knew that it would
 
 tell me how to feel the space you left behind
 and how to laugh instead of cry and how to say goodbye
 
 here i stand arms open wide
 i've held you close, kept you safe
 till you could fly
 
 tell me where the road ahead is gonna bend
 and how to harness up the wind and how to say goodbye
 
 
 god, for the life of me
 i don't know why
 we hurt each other
 in the name of what is right.
 god, for the life of me
 i don't understand
 echos everyday of man's
 inhumanity to man.
 man's inhumanity to man.
 
 
 there's a river of sorrow
 running through my heart.
 through the long night i will follow
 the glimmer in the dark.
 lord, you are the human spark.
 
 god, for the life of me
 i cannot explain
 how people born of love
 lose their way to hate.
 oh, there's gotta be a better way.

 i am not passers by, i am not a white lie
 i am not left to die, i am love, i am love
 i am not feeling sad, i am not a few fad
 i am not quickly mad, i am love, i am love
 
 you can try to hide, you can try to run
 but you'll never run far enough
 this is my flesh, this is my blood
 and i am love
 you can fly up high, you can dig down deep
 you can flee to the west
 you can flee to the east
 but you can't escape what i've done
 i am love
 
 i am not standing by, i am not letting go
 i am not leaving you, i am love, i am love
 my blood feel like the rain
 i did not bleed in vain
 but from my veins
 i am love

 looking at the future
 who can tell you what is going on
 it seems we have become the generation
 of wars and bombs
 and the heart grows weak
 and the fear grows strong
 that the day may come and it may not be very long
 and you want to run
 but you don't know where
 so where do you go
 i know
 and i tell you
 
 
 i am sure there will be a day
 but it will not be like the nations say
 the lord will come when this life is through
 and his deep desire is to be with you
 hearts will fly when the new world starts
 and joy will rise like the morning star
 god will meet every cry of the heart
 and it's my prayer
 i want you to be there
 
 i like to think about the new creation
 things that god will do
 so every now and then i stop and close my eyes
 i enjoy the view
 and the heart grows strong
 and the fear grows weak
 and i cannot wait for the new world to come to me
 and while i dream
 oh, i pray for you
 cause he wants you to go
 i know
 and i tell you
 
 
 
 
 once upon a time
 i was faithless, strutting blind
 through the valley of the lost
 so now you find it rather strange
 when you hear me claim the name
 of the one who bears the cross, and i say
 
 
 i believe in you now
 a new light is showing me how
 i used to walk in the shadows of doubt
 but i believe in you now
 
 will there ever come a day
 when you follow in the way
 of the truth that sets you free?
 to where the thunder of a voice
 and the echo of a choice
 will bring you to your knees
 no longer running through the night
 a conversion to the light
 giving way to disbelief, and you say
 
 
 
 
 i'm in the river that flows from your throne
 water of life
 water of life
 it covers me and i breath again
 your love is breath to my soul
 
 i can hear your voice as you sing over me
 it's your song of hope breathing life into me
 i can feel your touch as i come close to you
 and it heals my heart
 you restore and renew

 this is my desire
 to honor you
 lord with all my heart
 i worship you
 all i have within me
 i give you praise
 all that i adore is in you
 
 lord, i give you my heart
 i give you my soul
 i live for you alone
 every breath that i take
 every moment i'm awake
 lord, have your way in me

 seems like it was only yesterday
 she was living here
 yea, she was living here
 lord knows why he's taken her away
 it isn't very clear, no it isn't very clear
 into every life a little rain must fall
 and losing one you love is like a storm
 but storms are passing
 
 
 i hear leesha
 singing in heaven tonight
 and in between the sadness
 i hear leesha
 telling me that she's alright
 
 life goes on even after life
 that's what i believe
 yea, that's what i believe
 leesha's gone, but she will still survive
 in a memory that i'm keeping here with me
 silencing the voice of mortal tragedy
 listening to whispers of the soul
 all is peaceful
 
 
 
 
 everybody's talkin' in the homeroom
 plans are being made for after school
 should you tell them how you're really feelin'
 or go along and play it cool
 well, i know, i know
 how it feels, i know, i know
 
 everybody's talkin', about a good time
 something tells you something isn't right
 but when you're lonely and the pressure's on you
 it's really hard to stand and fight
 
 well, i know, i know
 how you feel
 
 torn between the mind of the crowd
 and the matters of the heart
 
 i know, i know
 how you feel, i know, i know
 
 there's a light that holds you in the darkness
 there's a candle burning in the wind
 and if you can lean upon the father
 you can find the strength within
 
 well, i know, i know
 that you can
 
 now it seems like everybody's against you
 and no one really cares
 
 you don't know who to trust,
 you don't know where to turn
 well at least you know you've got a prayer
 so reach out for the one who understands you
 oh, he's been there
 
 he knows, he knows
 how you feel
 
 well, i know, that he knows, he knows
 i know, i know, that he knows
 
 
 who is the you that no one else can see
 in your heart, a lonely one afraid to be
 lost again, need a friend
 
 you hide your soul to keep the hurt inside
 all alone, your tears call out into the night
 is he there, does he care
 
 
 yes, i know your name
 every prayer you pray
 i'm the one who brought you to this place
 the voice who sings to you
 the hand that clings to you
 oh my child, i've always known your name, known your name
 
 i hold you close to me, close to heart
 and this kind of love will find you anywhere you are
 never fear, i am here
 
 
 
 
 once a true believer
 once there was a fire in your soul
 you were the epitome of blessed faith astir
 with thirst for holiness
 and hunger for the word
 now you move in other circles
 to the beat of different drums
 and i see only glimpses of the one you used to be
 the inspiration that you were to me'
 
 
 i miss the way his love would dance within your eyes
 i miss the way his heart was the soul of your life
 and somewhere in the saddest part of heaven's room
 our father sheds a tear for you
 he's missing you, too
 
 some are calling you a prodigal
 some aren't calling you at all
 but far away someone is calling you back home
 do you hear it anymore out there on your own

 lord, you're leading me
 with a cloud by day
 and then in the night
 the glow of a burning flame
 
 and everywhere i go i see you
 everywhere i go i see you
 
 and you take my hand
 and you wash it clean
 i know the promised land
 is light years ahead of me
 
 and everywhere i go i see you
 everywhere i go i see you
 
 and the eagle flies
 and the rivers run
 i look through the night
 i can see the risin' sun
 
 and everywhere i go i see you
 everywhere i go i see you
 
 well, the grass will die
 and the flowers fall
 but your word's alive
 will be after all
 
 and everywhere i go i see you
 everywhere i go i see you

 said it's sad, said it was a shame
 bet you thought i caught a boat to bombay
 on the line just to let you know
 i will be around
 
 underneath the bridge to nowhere
 like i'm livin' out a game of solitaire
 goin' up to a better day
 i will be around
 
 hey world, it's me
 i still have the heart, still have the dream
 
 come on, people
 we've got to come together
 it's you and me
 hope will make us stronger
 freedom it rings
 do you hear it calling
 reach out and touch
 and love will take us higher
 
 somebody threw a brick at my vision
 tried to sabotage my mission
 either way, i believe
 i will be around
 
 i want to know, people are you with me
 open up your heart and just believe 
 take a step, let me hear you say
 i will be around
 
 hey world, it's me
 i still have the heart, still have the dream
 
 for he knows the plans he has for you
 a plan to prosper and not to harm you
 to give you a future, and a hope
 
 
 all to jesus
 i surrender
 all to him
 i freely give
 i will ever love and trust him
 in his presence daily live
 
 i surrender all
 i surrender all
 all to thee, my blessed savior
 i surrender all
 
 todo a cristo yo me rindo

 i saw you
 and you saw me
 and i didn't even know your name
 just one look
 that was all it took
 and i knew i'd never be the same
 if walkin' on air compares to what i feel
 then how can i keep it sealed when
 
 i want to tell the world
 if the smile on my face
 hasn't given me away already
 i want to tell the world
 there ain't no way to hide it
 your love has got me flyin' high
 since the day
 
 that you looked my way
 i knew we were meant to be together
 now i thank the lord
 for a love like yours
 'cause i know it's gonna last forever
 it's hard to believe my dreams have all come true
 and i'm so in love with you that
 
 i want to tell the world
 if the smile on my face
 hasn't given me away already
 i want to tell the world
 there ain't no way to hide it
 your love has got me flyin' high
 since the day
 
 i just want the world to know
 love has got me good to go
 
 
 i have got to get it out
 she is all i think about
 
 
 it's something' that i need to say
 love has overtaken me
 
 i want to tell the world
 if the smile on my face
 hasn't given me away already
 i want to tell the world
 there ain't no way to hide it
 your love has got me flyin' high
 since the day
 
 
 when you feel the sunlight
 fade into the cold night
 don't know where to turn
 i don't know where to turn
 and all the dreams you're dreaming
 seem to lose their meaning
 let me in your world
 baby, let me in your world
 all you need is someone you can hold
 don't be sad, you're not alone
 
 i will be here for you
 somewhere in the night
 somewhere in the night
 i'll shine a light for you
 somewhere in the night
 i'll be standing by
 i will be here for you
 
 in this world of strangers
 of cold and friendly faces
 someone you can trust
 oh there's someone you can trust
 i will be your shelter
 i'll give you my shoulder
 just reach out for my love
 reach out for my love
 call my name and my heart will hear
 i will be there, there's nothing to fear
 
 i will be here for you
 somewhere in the night
 somewhere in the night
 i'll shine a light for you
 somewhere in the night
 i'll be standing by
 i will be here for you
 
 i will be here for you
 somewhere in the night
 somewhere in the night
 i'll shine a light for you
 somewhere in the night
 i'll be standing by
 i will be here for you
 
 i will be here for you
 somewhere in the night
 somewhere in the night
 i'll shine a light for you
 somewhere in the night
 i'll be standing by
 i will be here for you
 
 i will be here for you
 
 
 so many memories and so many miles
 the road that stretches behind us
 we've had some laughter and our share 
 of tears
 but all these moments unite us
 
 i'll be your friend for a lifetime
 against the wind and the rain of every season
 won't walk away in the hard times
 i will be your friend
 i'm saying i will be your friend
 
 sure as the river runs to the sea
 high as the mountain that reaches
 you were there by my side till the end
  helped me on my feet again
 
 so in the valley walk on
 don't have to face it alone
 cause in the hard times 
 we keep growing strong
 as we learn, as we live
 that we live when we give
 
 
 sometimes i wonder if my beating heart has a reason
 the thought of breathing only takes my breath away
 i've spent so many nights wrestling with this feeling
 do i have the strength to make it through the day
 but i was never meant
 to walk this road alone
 i can always trust you
 when you say
 
 i will carry you
 be your strength
 and pull you through
 reach for me
 and take my hand
 we will pray
 and we will stand
 in a world
 crying out for peace
 let your heart be strong
 for when i am weak
 you will carry me
 
 sometimes you wonder if the road you're on has a reason
 it's hard to go on when you just don't know
 we can shoulder all the weight of life between us
 until the fear of what we cannot see is gone
 cause we were never meant
 to walk this road alone
 we are bound together
 when we say
 
 i will carry you
 be your strength
 and pull you through
 reach for me
 and take my hand
 we will pray
 and we will stand
 in a world
 crying out for peace
 let your heart be strong
 for when i am weak
 you will carry me
 
 i will carry you
 be your strength
 and pull you through
 in a world
 crying out for peace
 let your heart be strong
 for when i am weak
 you will carry me
 
 i will carry you
 be your strength
 and pull you through
 in a world
 crying out for peace
 let your heart be strong
 for when i am weak
 you will carry me
 
 and i will carry you
 please know, i will carry you
 
 
 hey boy - did you find out
 whatcha had to know - 'n what it's all about
 when you started to move - just a step at a time
 you never wanted to fall
 you took a chance on the wild side
 hey, girl - can'tcha come down
 are ya way at the top - afraid of somethin' you found
 then you try to go back - not as easy to do
 did you find who you are
 from a dance on the wild side
 
 i know sometimes it's hard for you
 to keep your feet upon the path that you've chosen
 it's not for you to walk alone
 together we can take this road where it's going - hang on
 
 
 stand by me - stand right here
 the time has come to say it clear
 now don't give up - but don't give in
 we will stand together to the end
 and i'll be around - i'll be around, yeah
 
 no joke - the sooner you find
 it happens all the same - for every mother's child
 when you walk in the dark - then you stumble and fall
 it's a part of it all
 when we dance on the wild side
 
 but everybody needs someone
 who loves 'em through the toughest times - while they're growing - yah
 who keeps a candle burning
 when the darkness covers up the path where they're going - hang on
 
 
 stand by me - stand right here
 the time has come to say it clear
 now don't give up - don't give in
 we will stand together to the end
 and i'll be around - come what may
 heaven hears us when we pray
 so don't give up - but don't give in
 we will stand together to the end
 i will be there, my good friend
 and i'll be around
 
 be around, i'll be around...
 i'll walk this road with you
 wherever it may wind
 and i'll be around
 
 
 
 
 wandering the road of desperate life
 aimlessly beneath a barren sky
 leave it to me
 i'll lead you home
 
 so afraid that you will not be found
 it won't be long before your sun goes down
 just leave it to me
 i'll lead you home
 
 
 hear me calling
 hear me calling
 just leave it to me
 i'll lead you home
 
 a troubled mind and a doubter's heart
 you wonder how you ever got this far
 leave it to me
 i'll lead you home
 
 vultures of darkness ate the crumbs you left
 you got no way to retrace your steps
 just leave it to me
 i'll lead you home
 
 hear me calling
 hear me calling
 you're lost and alone
 leave it to me
 i'll lead you home
 
 so let it go and turn it over to
 the one who chose to give his life for you
 leave it to me
 i'll lead you home
 
 hear me calling
 hear me calling
 you're lost and alone
 leave it to me
 i'll lead you home
 
 
 morning mystery pull me
 give me one more week and i'll be gone
 it's been a long hard month of sundays
 still no rain
 nothing left around here 
 but the dust and shame
 i know you know 
 i know you know
 
 and i'm trying to find a way, 
 to hold onto my faith
 while i wait, for you
 i'll wait for you
 
 now i lie awake at night
 trying hard to think, that these 
 are the hardest times i've ever seen
 i'm still holding on
 
 i know you never said it'd be easy
 all thick and no thin
 but the man who waits, is the man who wins
 i'm holding on, 
 i'm holding on
 
 but i hide myself away, and i hide myself away
 and i'll wait for you, i'll wait for you
 i'll wait for you, i'll wait for you
 
 i need you now 
 i need you now, 
 lord i need you now 
 
 and i'll wait for you, i'll wait for you
 i'm gonna wait for you, oh i wait for you,
 
 i'm gonna walk on, and not get weary, now
 i'm gonna run, and not fall down
 i know that someday i'll get my wits about
 
 you will carry me, 
 you will carry me
 
 i'm gonna rise up, like an eagle, now
 gonna ride that big blue sky,
 
 i'm sure that someday, 
 won't look down again
 
 you will carry me
 you will carry me, even now 
  
 carry me, even now, 
 
 you will carry me, 
 you will carry me
 
 even now, oh carry me 
 
 
 i see you smiling at me
 and i fall into a daydream
 don't know what all of this means
 oh, is it love?
 logic is slipping away
 my heart's on a runaway train 
 
 i'm gone, yes i'm gone, yes i'm gone and
 it feels so right 
 
 each time i look in your eyes
 so glad you came into my life
 much more than an emotional high
 oh, this is love
 i know that i've made up my mind
 i'll stay for the rest of my life
 
 
 i am holding to the joy of my salvation
 i am glad to have a life that always grows
 and if the word of god is any indication
 i am doing even better than i know
 i am doing even better than i know
 there's a joy that even people of the world find
 in every good and perfect gift the father sends
 so i thank the lord that i was born the first time
 but i thank him more that i was born again
 oh, i thank him more that i was born again
 
 chorus:
 i am up
 like the sun is up
 i can feel my life on a rise
 i am up
 like the stars at night
 i get up on bein' alive
 i am up
 like the lord is up
 and my life is filled with his life
 i was freed and i am saved
 i am up
 i am up
 
 there are times life is so fine i can't contain it
 everywhere i look i see what god had done
 and i don't have to work and worry to sustain it
 when i walk with god his joy will always come
 when i walk with god his joy will always come
 
 
 
 
 i walked this road
 so very long ago
 to show the way
 so you would know
 i walked the road
 with holes in my hands in feet
 to make the way
 come follow me
 
 
 no, you are not alone
 you will be free indeed
 the journey begins and ends
 with me
 one million miles
 it starts with a step or two
 what are you waiting for?
 i'm waiting for you
 
 you run the race
 thinking you've almost won
 then you may find
 you've only begun
 
 you're on the road
 thinking you're far from here
 and suddenly find
 you're very near
 
 
 
 
 i really want to see you
 i really want to touch you
 if only i could hold you in my arms again
 i really want to reach you
 forever to be with you
 if only i could hold you in my arms again
 
 it was written in the stars
 on the pages of my heart
 oh, that someday i would find
 the love i feel for you tonight
 
 on the ocean of our dreams
 like a prayer you came to me
 and the longing that had been
 found its ending in your eyes
 and i am missing you tonight
 
 i really want to see you
 i really want to touch you
 if only i could hold you in my arms again
 i really want to reach you
 forever to be with you
 if only i could hold you in my arms again
 
 across the waves, across the sea
 separating you from me
 here's a promise and it's mine
 i will love you for all time
 i'm wishing you were here tonight
 
 i really want to see you
 i really want to touch you
 if only i could hold you in my arms again
 i really want to reach you
 forever to be with you
 if only i could hold you in my arms again
 
 
 on the stairs she sits and waits
 she's crying out but nobody even cares
 
 holding in the hurt and pain
 looking for love to come pull her from this place
 
 
 i'm not gonna sit and stay in silence
 i'm not gonna walk away in silence
 
 sometimes we're loudest when
 the doors are shut and no one can see our face
 
 but it seems we're quiet when
 someone needs a touch of heaven's grace, oh yeah
 
 i'm not gonna sit and stay in silence
 i'm not gonna walk away in silence
 
 we are all god's children
 we need to count off all we've been given, oh yeah
 we are all god's children
 we need to tell off all we've been given, oh yeah, oh yeah
 
 i'm not gonna sit and stay
 i'm not gonna walk away
 
 i'm not gonna sit and stay in silence
 i'm not gonna walk away in silence, yeah, in silence
 i'm not gonna walk away in silence
 
 
 joyful, joyful we adore thee,
 god of glory, lord of love
 hearts unfold like flowers before thee
 opening to the sun above
 melt the clouds of sin and sadness,
 drive the dark of doubt away,
 giver of immortal gladness,
 fill us with the light of day.
 
 all thy works with joy surround thee,
 earth and heaven reflect thy rays,
 stars and angels sing around thee,
 center of unbroken praise.
 field and forest, vale and mountain,
 flowery meadow, flashing sea,
 chanting bird and flowing fountain,
 call us to rejoice in thee.
 
 mortals, join the happy chorus
 which the morning stars began
 father love is reigning o'er us,
 brother love binds man to man.
 ever singing, march we onward,
 victors in the midst of strife,
 joyful music leads us sun-ward
 in the triumph song of life.
 
 joyful of joyful
 lord we adore thee
 the god of glory
 the lord of love
 
 
 jingle bells, jingle bells
 jingle all the way
 oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
 jingle bells, jingle bells
 jingle all the way
 oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
 on dasher, on dancer, on prancer, on vixen
 on comet, on cupid, on donner, on blitzen
 put on your bells, your christmas bells
 
 come on, we're going for a sleigh ride
 christmas time is here again
 come on, we're going for a sleigh ride
 to spread good cheer again
 from the top of the chimney to the top of the wall
 dash away, dash away, dash away all
 
 old saint nicholas, he took a flight
 the moon was shining bright
 bring out the bells
 ol' saint nick was riding through the sky
 you should have seen those reindeer fly
 
 bring out the bells, it's a holiday season
 bring out the bells, it's a happy time
 bring out the bells, we've got a good reason
 to ring the bells and hear those pretty bells chime
 
 
 sun comes up sunday morn 
 on the little church where i been since i was born 
 and there he stood a hearty smile 
 you could hear his voice ringing out for a country mile 
 
 and he could place your mind at ease 
 with his tenderness and a heart 
 that aimed to please 
 a pauper's hands a farmer's clothes 
 just a preacher man we called kentucky rose 
 
 he worked the soul like he worked the land 
 he spoke in ways that anyone could understand 
 simple words of simple faith 
 and when it came to love 
 he would go out of his way 
 
 a helping hand 
 a soothing chat 
 and he practiced what he preached imagine that 
 and as far as kindness goes 
 there was none compared to old kentucky rose 
 
 evening stroll 'cross shyler's bridge 
 that's when he saw the boy 
 trapped below that rocky ridge 
 he knew the danger he would face 
 but it's as if he saved the child 
 only to take his place 
 
 for on that ridge of stone and ice 
 kentucky met his maker in a sacrifice 
 why he's gone 
 god only knows 
 maybe for the company of his kentucky rose 
 
 so peaceful in his sunday best 
 he was buried on a hill and laid to rest 
 when people heard they came in droves 
 to say their last good-byes to sweet kentucky rose 
 
 now, on that hill 
 one flower grows 
 they say it is the spirit of kentucky rose
 they say it is the spirit of kentucky rose 
 i believe it is the spirit of kentucky rose
 
 
 here we are on a boat out on the sea
 off the coast of africa
 heading for peaceful shores
 with a cast of strangers
 to an island hideaway
 i hear you telling me
 of the place we soon will be
 a rebirth from life's demise
 where the world is still, it's ideal
 anything you dream is real
 it's hotel paradise
 and you say it's nice 
 
 lamu, far away
 leave the pain far behind you
 hoping it won't find you
 lamu, far away
 you say it's there that you can run
 from the one inside of you
 
 so here we are on an island in the sea
 near the coast of africa
 and when it's right, lamu nights
 they can be so inviting
 heaven here on earth
 but here on earth
 but i hear you telling
 this is everything you need
 well, i don't think it's true
 'cause the way you feel isn't real
 you attempt to try and fill
 the void that's digging thru
 and it's killing you 
 
 lamu, far away
 leave the pain far behind you
 hoping it won't find you
 lamu, far away
 you say it's there that you can run
 from the one inside of you
 
 
 daddy's on the sofa, turning up another bottle to unleash when i get home
 i pretend he doesn't hit me
 momma just pretends that she don't know.
 
 i used to think of talking
 talking to my preacher
 he says i should just forgive and forget.
 now my baby brother just sits and recollects the same regrets.
 
 and i just wanna leave
 oh, god, please help me now, i wanna leave.
 
 as if that's not enough
 we're the new family around here
 guess that's all the reason some kids need
 'cause they all call me names, and say i should just take it on the chin.
 
 if i'm overreacting, then why is it so cold here
 why is it so cold here, in this hell
 why would my friend suzy
 tell me i should just go kill myself?
 
 and i just wanna leave
 oh, god, please help me now, i wanna leave
 and i, i just wanna leave
 oh, god, please help me now, i wanna leave
 
 oh, i wanna get out of here
 oh, god, help me now, i really wanna leave,
 
 
 
 and i, just wanna leave
 oh, god, please help me now, i wanna leave
 oh, but i, i just wanna believe
 oh, god, please hear me now, i wanna believe
 i just need to know, that you're really out there
 tell me if you're really out there, 'cause i believe.

 i'm looking at you, old friend of mine
 there's no use pretending that everything's fine
 now don't be so brave, don't be so proud
 i want you to know that i'm here for you now
 
 i can see you hurting and it's hurting me
 it doesn't have to be this way
 
 
 
 if you let me hold you closer
 
 let me know you
 
 let me show you the way
 
 
 i'm feeling for you, feeling so much
 when this heart is big enough for the both of us
 i'll give you my love if you give me your pain
 i'll hold it inside of me 'till you're stronger again
 
 well, i hate seeing you so far away
 when not a word can say it enough
 
 
 
 i'll be your rock for this day
 when i hear you calling out my name
 cause i know you'd only do the same for me
 
 
 
 
 i cannot follow you, my love,
 you cannot follow me.
 i am the distance you put between
 all of the moments that we will be.
 
 you know who i am,
 you've stared at the sun,
 well i am the one who loves
 changing from nothing to one.
 
 sometimes i need you naked,
 sometimes i need you wild,
 i need you to carry my children in
 and i need you to kill a child.
 
 you know who i am
 
 if you should ever track me down
 i will surrender there
 and i will leave with you one broken man
 whom i will teach you to repair.
 
 you know who i am
 
 i cannot follow you, my love,
 you cannot follow me.
 i am the distance you put between
 all of the moments that we will be.
 
 you know who i am
 
 
 never should have tasted that forbidden fruit
 tell me why do i always do
 what i don't want to do
 now, i'm the only reaper of the seeds that i sow
 and when i walk the field of my stubborn will
 it's a hard row to hoe
 there's a price for getting smarter
 so i pay what i owe
 while bridges burn
 let the shadow fall behind me
 i am wiser i know
 we live and learn
 always living and learning
 always living and learning
 is it out of the fire, back in to the pan
 is once enough to let it all sink in-or will i do it again
 a time for understanding has now come of age
 so i heed the word of the counselor and the voice of the sage
 try to see the meaning
 read between every line
 when pages turn
 there'll be no room for explaining what has been well-defined
 we live and learn
 always living and learning
 always living and learning
 
 an engaging temptation had me doing time
 cause when it starts a fire under strong desire
 we are partners in crime
 but hindsight is clearer
 i can where i've gone and never return
 it's a new man in the mirror
 it's a new freedom song to live and learn
 always living and learning
 always living and learning
 
 
 you painted me a picture of tomorrow
 a place where you and i walked hand in hand
 a world without despair and without shadows
 but things just didn't turn out how we'd planned
 now you're gone
 
 
 and i believe that there is somewhere
 where the angels fill the sky
 and i believe we'll live forever
 you and i, you and i
 will never die
 
 i wonder if you knew that you were leaving
 i thought that i saw something in your eyes
 you painted me a picture of believing
 i'll see you there on the other side
 and i'll be there

 preach the gospel to all the world, 
 and if necessary, use words. st. francis of assisi
 
 we're passengers aboard the train
 silent little lambs amidst the pain
 that's no longer good enough
 and when it's time to speak our faith
 we use a language no one can explain
 that's no longer good enough
 
 and god knows it's a shame
 as we look to pass the flame
 we are not the worthy bearers of his name
 
 
 for the world to know the truth
 there can be no greater proof
 than to live the life, live the life
 there's no love that's quite as pure
 there's no pain we can't endure
 if we live the life, live the life
 be a light for all to see
 for every act of love will set you free
 
 there's something beautiful and bold
 the power of a million human souls
 come together as one
 and each in turn goes out to lead
 another by his word, his love, his deed
 now the circle is done
 
 it all comes back to one
 for it is he and he alone
 who has lived the only perfect life we've known
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 jesus, i've forgotten the words that you have spoken
 promises that burned within my heart have now grown dim
 with a doubting heart i follow the paths of earthly wisdom
 forgive me for my unbelief
 renew the fire again
 
 
 lord have mercy
 christ have mercy 
 lord have mercy on me
 
 i have built an altar where i worship things of god
 i have taken journeys that have drawn me far from you
 now i am returning to your mercies ever flowing
 pardon my transgressions
 help me love you again
 
 
 
 i have longed to know you and your tender mercies
 like a river of forgiveness ever flowing without end
 i bow my heart before you in the goodness of your presence
 your grace forever shining
 like a beacon in the night

 we're embarking on a new regime
 we are calling for a new revolution
 be part of the parade

 come on everyone
 there's a lot that can be done
 a little love can go a long, long way
 so rise to the occasion
 of a radical invasion
  don't let the world go down in flames
 fight the fire with a fire
 push it to the limit
 and be a renegade
 light a fuse-make a spark
 try to penetrate a heart
 there's a burning need to fill the world with love
 love is kind, love is sound
 it makes the world go round
 so it keep it turning
 there could never be enough
 hatred'll spoil the feast
 that's the nature of the beast
 so don't ever let your heart be swayed
 draw the sword, slay the dragon
 get on the bandwagon

 darkness thick and heavy
 black and steady screaming darkness
 anyone who hates his brother
 who plans evil for another
 walks in darkness
 sonlight, warm and shining
 purifying, welcome sonlight
 everyone who loves completely
 with a heart that opens freely
 walks in sonlight
 
 let us love in the light
 for love is from god
 if we love what is right
 we show whose we are
 in a world of the dying
 we're living our parts
 if we love in the light
 with all of our hearts
 
 blindness, terrifying, 
 left for dying, spirit blindness
 anyone who thirsts for evil plots
 his very own upheaval
 lost in blindness
 new sight, truth unending 
 faith unbending, new sight
 everyone who seeks 
 the father leaves the world
 and all its bother
 sees with new sight
 
 let us love in the light
 for love is from god
 if we love what is right
 we show whose we are
 in a world of the dying
 we're living our parts
 if we love in the light
 with all of our hearts
 
 
 sometimes i feel like this world
 is just one big gigantic merry-go-round
 you gotta hold on tight or you get hurled through the air
 yeah, life is a three-ring circus
 with clowns and freaks and camels and such
 and you never know when you might be attacked by the bears
 
 
 give me love, give me love, love me good
 sometimes i feel like
 i'm afraid of my own shadow and then
 sometimes i can feel as bold as genghis khan
 but i could never live in a yurt
 on a diet of mongolian barbecue
 i conquer the world for a moment, then the moment is gone
 
 chorus
 
 bridge:
 
 let us take a moment now to bow our heads and pray
 if only to give thanks for making it through another day
 
 sometimes i wish i was in a movie
 or some 70's tv thing
 where everything gets neatly wrapped by the end of the show
 yeah, but this ain't hollywood
 and this sure ain't the brady bunch
 and how this plot's gonna all pan out, i don't really know
 
 chorus
 
 
 my jesus i love thee, i know thou art mine
 for thee all the follies of sin i resign
 my gracious redeemer, my saviour art thou
 if ever i loved thee, my jesus, 'tis now
 
 i love thee because thou has first loved me
 and purchased my pardon on calvary's tree
 i love thee for wearing the thorns on thy brow
 if ever i loved thee my jesus 'tis now
 
 i'll love thee in life and i will love thee in death
 and praise thee as long as thou lendest me breath
 and say when the death dew lies cold on my brow
 if ever i loved thee my jesus 'tis now
 
 i love you jesus
 i'll always love you
 now and forever
 i belong to you
 
 in mansions of glory and endless delight
 i'll ever adore thee in heaven so bright
 i'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow
 if ever i loved thee my jesus 'tis now
 
 i love you jesus
 i'll always love you
 now and forever
 i belong to you
 
 i love you jesus
 i'll always love you
 now and forever
 i belong to you
 i belong to you
 i belong to you
 
 lift jesus higher
 lift jesus higher
 lift jesus higher
 lift jesus higher
 lift jesus higher
 lift jesus higher
 lift jesus higher
 
 
 i had a dream that i was speaking
 with a prophet from the land of wise
 in a crowd of people from the land of troubled hearts
 i said we've come here for answers
 a solution to our world's demise
 he said the journey would be long
 but here's where you start
 
 love one another
 love one another
 work it in to work it out
 there could never be enough
 love one another
 love one another
 cause you know without a doubt
 you can change your world with love
 
 it was a simple conclusion
 but i thought that it was rather profound
 just a fundamental law that we should all live by
 i took it in to tomorrow
 yea, i walked the earth but i never found
 any corner of the world
 where this did not apply
 
 love one another
 love one another
 work it in to work it out
 there could never be enough
 love one another
 love one another
 cause you know without a doubt
 you can change your world with love
 
 and looking out i saw no method to the madness there
 like in a vision from the isle of patmos, i was scared
 it was a revelation
 love is getting rare
 
 the people of the land united
 and in my dream we all agreed
 that we should start again
 and this would be our creed
 
 love one another
 love one another
 work it in to work it out
 there could never be enough
 love one another
 love one another
 cause you know without a doubt
 you can change your world with love

 if i could, i would tell you why
 the first time i saw her i could touch the sky
 i turned to stone, and i could not speak
 she had the ability to make me weep
 
 always wishing, always hoping
 that she'll get the message from the bottom of my heart
 let's together share forever
 it's just a matter of time
 
 i had to wait and just let her breathe
 that's never been easy for a man to see
 she moved slow and she took her time
 she kept me guessing what was on her mind
 
 always wishing, always hoping
 that you'd get the message from the bottom of my heart
 let's forever be together
 it's just a matter of time
 
 
 away in a manger
 no crib for a bed
 the little lord jesus laid down his sweet head
 the stars in the sky looking down where he lay
 the little lord jesus asleep on the hay
 
 child in the manger, infant of mary
 outcast and stranger, lord of all
 child who inherits
 all our transgressions
 all our demerits on him fall
 
 once the most holy
 child of salvation
 gentle and lowly
 now as our glorious mighty redeemer
 see him victorious
 o'er each foe
 
 prophets fortold him
 infant of wonder
 angels behold him on his throne
 worthy our savior
 of all our praises
 happy forever
 are his own
 
 
 joy to the world
 the lord has come
 let earth receive her king
 let every heart
 prepare him room
 
 and heaven and nature sing
 and heaven and nature sing
 and heaven, and heaven and nature sing
 
 joy to the earth
 the savior reigns
 let men their songs employ
 
 while fields and floods
 rocks, hills, and plains
 repeat the sounding joy
 repeat the sounding joy
 repeat, repeat the sounding joy
 
 he rules the world
 with truth and grace
 and makes the nations prove
 the glories of his righteousness
 
 and wonders of his love
 and wonders of his love
 and wonders, wonders of his love

 good king wenceslaus looked out on the feast of stephen.
 when the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even.
 brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel,
 when a poor man came in sight, gathering winter fuel. 
 
 hither page and stand by me if thou know'st it telling
 yonder peasant, who is he, where and what his dwelling?
 sire, he lives a good league hence, underneath the mountain,
 right against the forest fence, by saint agnes' fountain. 
 
 bring me flesh and bring me wine, bring me pine logs hither
 thou and i will see him dine when we bear them thither
 page and monarch forth they went, forth they went together
 through the rude winds wild lament, and the bitter weather. 
 
 sire the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger
 fails my heart, i know not how, i can go no longer.
 mark my footsteps my good page, tread thou in them boldly
 thou shalt find the winter's rage freeze thy blood less coldly. 
 
 in his master's steps he trod where the snow lay dinted
 heat was in the very sod which the saint had printed
 therefore christian men be sure, wealth or rank possessing,
 ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing.
 
 
 still searching for that boy who had the faith to move a mountain. 
 want the fire back.
 
 another question in me
 one for the powers that be
 it's got me thrown and so
 i put on my poker face
 and try to figure it out
 this undeniable doubt
 a common occurrence
 feeling so out of place
 
 guarded and cynical now
 can't help but wondering how
 my heart evolved into a
 rock beating inside of me
 so i reel, such a stoic ordeal
 where's that feeling that i don't feel?
 
 
 there was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain
 and like a child he would believe without a reason
 without a trace he disappeared into the void and
 i've been searching for that missing person
 
 under a lavender moon
 so many thoughts consume me
 who dimmed that glowing light
 that once burned so bright in me
 is this a radical phase
 a problematical age
 that keeps me running
 from all that i used to be
 
 is there a way to return
 is there a way to unlearn
 that carnal knowledge
 that's chipping away at my soul
 i've been gone too long
 will i ever find my way home?
 
 
 
 there was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain
 and like a child he would believe without a reason
 without a trace he disappeared into the void and
 i've been searching for that missing person
 he used to want to try to walk the straight and narrow
 he had a fire and he could feel it in the marrow
 it's been a long time and i haven't seen him lately but
 i've been searching for that missing person

 i am only human
 struggling to find
 confidence in all that i believe
 you are only holy
 you are love defined
 and you have said to ask and i'll receive
 so i have come to pray
 that you will come and fill
 the hunger here inside me to grow
 stronger in the faith
 there's a longing and a need
 to have you ever closer
 come fill me
 cause when you move in me
 it's like a symphony
 the timeless melody 
 that soothes my soul
 though silent i can tell
 that you're alive and well
 cause i can feel you move
 in me
 what they try to tell me 
 is that your love is falsewhat they try to tell me
 is that your is false
 and faith is just a way
 i choose to feel
 and that there was no meaning
 to you upon the cross
 and i should reach for something that is real
 and when those words are said
 the questions in me start
 and i don't have any answers
 until i stop thinking with my head
 and start listening to my heart
 and there i find my assurance
 i tell them
 chorus
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 i have been unfaithful
 i have been unworthy
 i have been unrighteous
 and i have been unmerciful
 
 i have been unreachable
 i have been unteachable
 i have been unwilling
 and i have been undesirable
 
 
 sometimes, i have been unwise
 i've been undone by what i'm unsure of
 but because of you, and all that you went through
 i know that i have never been unloved
 
 i have been unbroken
 i have been unmended
 i have been uneasy
 and i've been unapproachable
 
 i've been unemotional
 i've been unexceptional
 i've been undecided
 and i have been unqualified
 
 
 
 unaware, i have been unfair
 i've been unfit for blessings from above
 but even i can see the sacrifice you made for me
 to show that i have never been unloved
 
 
 no eye had seen
 no ear had heard
 'til hosts on high
 proclaimed the birth
 and heaven brought down
 
 its only child
 
 the son of man
 
 the world reconciled
 
 
 and song broke forth
 angelic strain
 and none could help
 but sing the name
 
 emmanuel
 
 emmanuel
 
 emmanuel
 
 emmanuel
 
 
 
 woa-o-woa-oah-woa-o-woa-oah

 woa-o-woa-oah-woa-o-woa-oah
 what can wash away my sins
  nothing but the blood of jesus
 
 what can make me whole again
 nothing but the blood of jesus
 
 this is all my righteousness
 it's nothing but the blood of jesus
 
 this is all my hope and peace
 nothing but the blood of jesus
 
 nothing but the blood of jesus
 nothing but the blood of jesus
 nothing but the blood of jesus
 nothing but the blood of jesus
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 oh lord, you're beautiful
 your face is all i seek
 for when your eyes are on this child
 your grace abounds to me, yeah
 
 oh lord, you're beautiful
 your face is all i seek
 for when your eyes are on this child
 your grace abounds to me
 
 for when your eyes are on this child
 your grace abounds to me, oh lord
 oh lord, you're beautiful, yes you are, oh lord
 oh lord, oh lord, you're beautiful, yes you are
 lord, you're beautiful
 
 
 in the passion your heart is abused 
 he is pushing you, you have to choose 
 oh, rebecca, love is never 
 easy anymore 
 oh, rebecca, so afraid of 
 losing what is yours 
 
 are you giving in to the pressure 
 holding you again, now he tells you 
 what it takes to be in love 
 he believes you're old enough 
 but how you gonna feel tomorrow 
 when the day reveals 
 what you believed was for the sake of love 
 don't you think you're old enough to know 
 
 you're a breed of few and far between 
 holding on to your romantic dream 
 oh, rebecca, love is patient 
 love would understand 
 oh, rebecca, your decision 
 is your only chance 
 
 are you giving in to the pressure 
 holding you again, now he tells you 
 what it takes to be in love 
 he believes you're old enough 
 but how you gonna feel tomorrow 
 when the day reveals 
 what you believed was for the sake of love 
 don't you think you're old enough to know 
 
 oh, rebecca don't confuse what love is 
 with what some say love should be 
 should be
 
 
 i'm not how i used to be
 when we hung around
 back when it was you and me
 tearin' up this town
 we used to live our lives running from change
 now we don't see eye to eye
 i am not the same
 
 
 and you wonder where i've gone
 well, i've found where i belong
 i'm on the other side
 true, i used to walk your shore
 but i'm not there anymore
 i'm on the other side
 
 years fade like the setting sun
 turning us loose
 they give us many ways to run
 and many roads to choose
 well, i ran into saving grace
 headed for nowhere
 love showed me another place
 and brought me there
 
 
 
 why is it hard for you to see
 all the changes made in me
 here on the other side
 oh, i could help you understand
 and you could join me where i am
 i am on the other side
 
 
 
 
 
 there always seems to be a door that you can't open
 there always seems to be a mountain you can't climb
 but you keep on reaching
 you just keep on reaching
 
 when your destiny is out there in the distance
 but the road ahead's a mine field in disguise
 and you keep on moving
 you just keep on moving
 
 you will make it through this
 just give it time
 you gotta give it time
 
 this is what you're made for
 standing in the downpour
 knowing that the sun will shine
 forget what lies behind you
 
 heaven walks beside you
 you got to give it one more try
 one more time
 
 you just keep on reaching
 you just keep on, you keep on moving
 
 when the shadows fall on everything you're dreaming
 when the promises turn out to be a lie
 you just keep believing
 you just keep believing
 oh, don't stop your dreaming
 it's gonna be alright
 it's gonna be alright
 you've got to keep on reaching
 keep believing
 it's gonna be alright
 
 
 many people in the steeple
 but no one leaves the walls
 quick to stand and speak all of their beliefs
 quick to leave you if you fall
 
 tell me where's the love
 it knows no boundaries
 tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah
 open arms, we need to be open arms
 
 never judge you, always loving
 needs to be what we become
 lifting up the lost, showing them the cross
 shining brightly like the sun
 
 tell me where's the love
 it knows no boundaries
 tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah
 open arms, we need to be open arms, yeah
 
 tell me where's the love
 it knows no boundaries
 tell me where's the love, yeah, yeah
 open arms, we need to be open arms, oh yeah
 and everybody sing
 
 open arms, we need to be open arms
 and the whole world sing
 open arms, we need to be open arms

 in this world, it's out of this world
 
 look to the future
 who's in the picture

 still you've got a friend in me
 
 today, tomorrow
 laughter and sorrow
 gonna be some lows and highs
 might as well enjoy the ride
 
 you will find that life's worth living
 in this world, it's out of this world
 with a little love and a little giving
 in this world, it's out of this world

 pull all your hair up 
 dab on the make up 
 tryin' hard to look so pristine 
 like a face in a magazine 
 those fancy dressers 
 and media pressure 
 got you feeling so plain and small 
 if you don't look like a paper doll 
 
 in a world where the goal is 
 to be like the joneses 
 it's guaranteed to drive you wild 
 keeping up with the latest style 
 gaze in the mirror 
 you want the glamour 
 and the grace of a movie star 
 but i like you the way you are 
 you are the only one i'm dreamin' of 
 'cause baby don't you know that i love 
 
 you, girl 
 you don't have to be picture perfect 
 to be in my world 
 girl 
 you don't have to be picture perfect 
 to fit the frame 
 
 you're tender you're tactful 
 girl you're a natural 
 you possess a heart that's true 
 that's what i like about you 
 one in a million 
 yeah that's a given 
 there's a beauty inside of you 
 and it shows on the outside too 
 no competition you're way in the lead 
 and baby don't you know that i need 
 
 you, girl 
 you don't have to be picture perfect 
 to be in my world 
 girl 
 you don't have to be picture perfect 
 to fit the frame
 
 
 the wind is moving
 but i am standing still
 a life of pages
 waiting to be filled
 a heart that's hopeful
 a head that's full of dreams
 but this becoming
 is harder than it seems
 feels like i'm
 
 looking for a reason
 roaming through the night to find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 not a lot to lean on
 i need your light to help me find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 
 if there are millions
 down on their knees
 among the many
 can you still hear me?
 hear me asking
 where do i belong?
 is there a vision
 that i can call my own?
 show me i'm
 
 looking for a reason
 roaming through the night to find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 not a lot to lean on
 i need your light to help me find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 
 looking for a reason
 roaming through the night to find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 not a lot to lean on
 i need your light to help me find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 
 looking for a reason
 roaming through the night to find
 my place in this world
 my place in this world
 
 
 here is where the road divides
 here is where we realize
 the sculpting of the father's great design
 through' time you've been a friend to me
 but time is now the enemy
 i wish we didn't have to say goodbye
 but i know the road he chose for me
 is not the road he chose for you
 so as we chase the dreams we're after
 
 pray for me and i'll pray for you
 pray that we will keep the common ground
 won't you pray for me and i'll pray for you
 and one day love will bring us back around again
 
 painted on our tapestry
 we see the way it has to be
 weaving through' the laughter and the tears
 but love will be the tie that binds us
 to the time we leave behind us
 memories will be our souvenirs
 and i know that through' it all
 the hardest part of love is letting go
 but there's a greater love that holds us
 
 pray for me and i'll pray for you
 pray that we will keep the common ground
 won't you pray for me and i'll pray for you
 and one day love will bring us back around again
 
 
 
 
 
 prepare ye the way
 prepare ye the way of the lord
 prepare ye the way
 prepare ye the way of the lord
 
 yeshua you reign on high
 you reign on high
 almighty god
 your love is like no other
 yeshua you reign on high
 almighty god
 your love is like no other
 
 
 one man come in the name of love
 one man come and go
 one man come here to justify
 one man to overthrow
 in the name of love!
 one man in the name of love
 in the name of love!
 what more? in the name of love!
 
 one man caught on a barbed wire fence
 one man he resists
 one man washed on an empty beach
 one man betrayed with a kiss
 
 in the name of love!
 what more in the name of love?
 in the name of love!
 what more? in the name of love!
 
 nobody like you
 there's nobody like you
 
 mm mm mm
 early morning, april 4
 shot rings out in the memphis sky
 free at last, they took your life
 they could not take your pride
 
 in the name of love!
 what more in the name of love?
 in the name of love!
 what more in the name of love?
 in the name of love!
 what more in the name of love

 wake up and dream about
 the plans you have in store for you
 but keep in mind
 it's not just what you do
 but what you do it for-and who
 there are roads to discover
 there are stories yet to be told
 as you see the big picture
 just beginning to unfold 
 
 break down the barriers but
 don't bend the rules
 never forget your roots
 as you head for something new
 ride through the shades of desire
 letting the light be seen
 and he'll steer the heart in the
 pursuit of the dream
 
 it's alright to find yourself
 thinking now and then
 about the way you want your life to be
 anticipating what lies
 just around the bend
 can't wait to see
 
 comes the time of decision
 some you dodge and some you should face
 as you see the big picture
 there will be some dues to pay 
 
 break down the barriers but
 don't bend the rules
 never forget your roots
 as you head for something new
 ride through the shades of desire
 letting the light be seen
 and he'll steer the heart in the
 pursuit of the dream
 
 wake up and dream about
 the plans you have in store for you
 but keep in mind
 it's not just what you do
 but what you do it for-and who
 
 there are choices that build you
 choices that will make you fall
 all part of the big picture
 one day you will see it all
 
 break down the barriers but
 don't bend the rules
 never forget your roots
 as you head for something new
 ride through the shades of desire
 letting the light be seen
 and he'll steer the heart in the
 pursuit of the dream
 
 
 sometimes the journey makes you weary
 feels like a long and winding road
 sometimes this life can lose it's meaning
 but you might be surprised to find some hope
 maybe you're wondering where love is
 you may fell it's far away from here
 maybe you're wondering where i am
 you might be surprised to find i'm near
 
 
 and when your life is tossed and turning
 and you are on the raging sea
 i'll come and pull you from the water
 then you will know that you are free
 
 so if you're stumbling through the valley
 or if you're tempted to give up the fight
 reach out your hand and i will lead you
 i will be your strong arm in the night
 
 
 
 
 another million miles from the truth now
 i know there's peace but i can't seem
 to figure out how
 to stop this race that's taking over me
 i'm under the gun i wait for you to see
 
 oh, please reach out to me
 open my eyes to see
 i'm running from you now
 come rescue me somehow
 
 another scar from fighting the truth now
 has left me like a stranger to my need now
 a masquerade, a game to figure out now
 a cruel charade i cannot scream aloud
 
 a narrow stretch of road in the way now
 a heavy load still hanging on to me now
 i'm in a maze that i can't seem to get out
 without a view from these shoulders of doubt

 on the street it never changes
 there's a chill in the air
 icy people, empty faces
 not a word, not a soul who cares
 do you give up
 have you given in to the lie that a heart never changes
 don't be fooled by what you see there
 another man with another case of
 chorus:
 one restless heart
 who never could find love
 too many hurts
 to reach out again
 how can he know
 love still wants to find him
 one restless shell of a man
 
 don't look away
 in a moment his life could be new
 just a moment and love could break through
 oh finally some place to start
 for a man with a restless heart
 
 why the fear then, why the worry
 why the walls holding love inside
 when you're needed in the fury
 in the fighting to save men's lives
 don't you give up
 don't be giving in to the lie that a heart never changes
 if you reach out god'll reach in
 bring an end to another case of
 
 chorus
 
 one restless heart, one restless heart
 one restless heart, one restless heart
 he's got to know that love still can find him
 love can reach any man
 
 don't look away
 in a moment his life could be new
 just a moment and love could break through
 oh finally some place to start
 for a man with a restless heart
 
 tag:
 don't you look away
 oh never a stranger again
 love has saved a restless man
 finally some place to start
 for a man with a restless heart
 
 tag
 
 
 
 
 
 walk across the shore
 walk across the sea
 stand upon the waves
 and walk with me
 journey through the door
 come see what i can see
 all the reasons we were made
 who we were meant to be
 
 rise, he's calling you to go
 just leave it all behind
 and rise above
 
 beyond the obvious
 and what you can attain
 past the here and now
 where faith remains
 lift your weary head
 there's too much left to lose
 more than you can imagine
 it's waiting there for you
 
 rise, he's calling you to come
 just leave it all behind
 and rise above
 
 come and stand
 and join with me as one
 now take my hand and we
 will rise above
 
      
 
 rise, he's calling you to come
 just leave it all behind
 and rise above
 come and stand
 and join with me as one
 now take my hand and we

 come stand with me
   
 come stand with me
 
 
 a friday night affair
 out in the city heat
 always a party there
 along the sordid street
 and it was guaranteed
 the place to be was rocketown
 the drinks were two for one
 inside the crowded bars
 the girls would make their run
 out on the boulevard
 it was the idol place
 we lived the ways of rocketown
 hang around by the street light
 in the heart of the night life
 
 there came a certain man
 a stranger to the crowd
 we didn't understand
 what he was all about
 he walked a different pace
 so out of place in rocketown
 
 they made a fool of him
 they teased him when he'd speak
 but when they knocked him down
 he'd turn the other cheek
 he told me i could find
 a life outside of rocketown
 hang around by the street light
 in the heart of the night life
 
 what was his mission
 where was he going
 why was his heart light
 always glowing
 all i was missing
 he stood there holding
 what was his secret
 could i know it
 
 some didn't like him near
 some laughed and turned away
 but me, i longed to hear
 all that he had to say
 he had a peace of mind
 i couldn't find in rocketown
 and when i reached down inside me
 i could feel the emptiness
 
 what was his mission
 where was he going
 why was his heart light
 always glowing
 all i was missing
 he stood there holding
 what was his secret
 could i know it
 
 he said it's in the heart
 this change that comes to be
 now he had done his part
 the choice was up to me
 as we were standing there
 he said a prayer for rocketown
 as we were standing there
 he said a prayer for rocketown
 as we were standing there
 he said a prayer for rocketown
 
 he walked off silently
 and prayed for me
 and rocketown
 
 what was his mission
 where was he going
 why was his heart light
 always glowing
 all i was missing
 he stood there holding
 what was his secret
 could i know it
 
 
 control, i give up control
 i can't carry this alone
 i've tried, for so long i've tried
 to make it on my own
 now dreams are scattered on the ground
 and now i'm on my knees
 
 i, i can't help myself
 i can't help myself
 i'm gonna run to you
 i, i can't help myself
 i can't help myself
 i'm gonna run to you, run to you
 
 weak, there are times i'm weak
 if my scars could speak, they'd say
 that grace is my only hope
 grace is showing me the way
 to where all my shadows disappear
 and healing waits for me
 
 i, i can't help myself
 
 i can't help myself
 i'm gonna run to you
 i, i can't help myself
 i can't help myself
 i'm gonna run to you, run to you
 
 what kind of love is this?
 lifts me up and draws me in
 tonight i'm just a heart running back home
 when everything is pushed aside
 all my plans and all my pride
 tonight i'm just a heart coming back home
 
 i can't help myself
 i'm gonna run to you
 i, i can't help myself
 i can't help myself
 i'm gonna run to you, run to you
 i'm gonna run to you
 
 
 lost 
 my heart is hard as stone 
 on my own, alone, i carry it home 
 gone 
 i used to waste the days, 
 so distraught, i thought, i'm changing my ways 
 now you're changing my ways 
 
 you save me 
 save me from myself 
 there is no one else 
 i'd lean on 
 save me 
 you save me from myself 
 there is no one else that sets me free 
 
 start 
 the start of something new 
 is what i find, when i'm just looking at you. 
 lift 
 you lift me off the ground, 
 keep holding my hand 
 i won't bend or even look down 
 
 don't look down! 
 don't look down! 
 
 you save me 
 save me from myself 
 there is no one else 
 i'd lean on 
 save me 
 you save me from myself 
 there is no one else that sets me free 
 
 
 you save me 
 save me from myself 
 there is no one else 
 i'd lean on 
 save me 
 you save me from myself 
 there is no one else that sets me free
 
 
 young man up on the hillside
 teaching new ways
 each word winning them over
 each heart a kindled flame
 old men watch from the outside
 guarding their prey
 threatened by the voice of the paragon
 leading their lambs away
 leading them far away
 
 nobody knew his secret ambition
 nobody knew his claim to fame
 he broke the old rules steeped in tradition
 he tore the holy veil away
 questioning those in powerful position
 running to those who called his name
 but nobody knew his secret ambition
 was to give his life away
 
 his rage shaking the temple
 his word to the wise
 his hand healing on the seventh day
 his love wearing no disguise
 some say, "death to the radical
 he's way out of line."
 some say, "praise be the miracle
 god sends a blessed sign.
 a blessed sign for troubled times."
 
 nobody knew his secret ambition
 nobody knew his claim to fame

 some people quietly reveal
 in the manner of the meek
 some people shout the way they feel
 to a radical degree
 some people sing it to express
 while others hear another call
 some people speak with subtleness
 some don't rely on words at all
 but let me tell you 'bout
 
 
 
 one thing i know
 everybody's got a seed to sow
 let your heart of hearts
 take you down the road
 everybody's got a seed to sow
 
 we all are pieces of the whole
 with different feelings to evoke
 giving distinction to the role
 different players-different strokes
 but let me tell you 'bout
 
 
 
 some people walk
 some people race
 some people vary in their pace
 but god can use what you can give
 within the mystery of his ways
 don't underestimate
 
 chorus
 
 
 from the first breath of her life
 she flew straight into my arms
 i used to catch her from the swings
 when she was five
 and now she dances on the wind
 in a world as hard as stone
 she's so anxious to begin
 and ready to fly
 
 and she walks with me
 and she talks with me
 and i hold her hand in mine
 i know she'll find her way
 like the light of day
 cause it's love that makes her strong
 
 though i cannot stop the rain
 and i cannot turn the tide
 and i am sure there will be things 
 that break her heart
 i can only let her know
 i am always on her side
 and even as i let her go
 i'll never be far
 
 and she walks with me
 and she talks with me
 in her eyes i see her truth
 born of her fire and grace
 as she finds her place
 cause it's love that makes her strong
 
 and she walks with me
 and she talks with me
 in my eyes she'll see my prayer
 as she turns each page
 through this tender age
 it is love that makes her strong
 it's her love that makes her strong

 you're weighed down with regret
 you can't see the road ahead
 or the burden on your back
 it seems the trek will never end
 the winding paths that still descend
 and up above a sky washed black
 you just can't bear to look at that
 
 
 follow the signs
 open your eyes
 read between the lines of what you see
 look into the soul of reality
 open your mind
 look at the signs
 never look back at yesterday
 keep your gaze steady on the narrow way
 
 now you've found the sacred tree
 you kneel upon the broken wheat
 you watch your burden fall away
 and all the things that you once sought
 now are counted less than lost
 for now you see the light of day
 the signs were pointing all the way
 
 
 
 follow the signs
 open your eyes
 look at the signs
 open your mind
 follow the signs
 
 
 
 
 silent night, holy night

 radiant beams from thy holy face
 with the dawn of redeeming grace

 counting every moment
 biding all my time
 standing out here on my own
 searching for that someone
 to heal this heart of mine
 and keep me from being alone
 but when will it be
 and how will i know
 i don't want to wait here forever
 
 somebody love me
 come and carry me away
 somebody need me
 to be the blue in their grey
 somebody want me
 the way i've always dreamed it could be
 won't somebody love me, love me
 
 i'm waiting for somebody
 to dance across the floor
 sweeping me off of my feet
 i'm looking for the right one
 to open up that door
 and offer me a tender retreat
 it's like wanting to sing
 but needing a song
 when will i hear the music playing
 
 somebody love me

 and somehow through the lonely nights
 i will leave a light in the dark
 let it lead you to my heart
 
 and somewhere alone
 i will be praying you home
 i know that somehow our love
 
 our love will lead me to your arms
 
 somewhere far beyond today
 i will find a way to find you
 and somehow through the lonely nights
 i will leave a light in the dark
 let it lead you to my heart

 when i'm down when my soul's in need of rest
 come your words of comfort and of hope
 i see your face always smiling back at me
 a stream of light shining straight to the heart
 child of god, child of light
 there'll be no more lonely nights
 cause you have brightened up my life
 
 there's a road that leads me to this place
 a path of love running straight to the heart
 
 over the years i've learned one important thing
 it's that real friends shall never truly be apart
 you were there in my darkest time of need
 with a hand reaching straight to the heart
 
 child of god, child of light
 there'll be no more lonely nights
 cause you have brightened up my life
 
 take this gift, it is all i have to give
 a prayer of love forever straight to the heart
 
 
 just to rest in your arms
 close enough to hear your heart
 just to kneel at your feet
 where everything fades away and i sing
 
 jesus, jesus, take me over now
 i surrender
 everything i have, i lay it down
 all of me
 
 with just a glimpse of your face
 all my fears melt away
 lost within your embrace
 i'm pouring out all my admiration
 
 
 glory so beautiful
 the earth displays your majesty
 how could you ever be
 so mindful of someone as me
 
 you captivate
 splendor i have never seen
 nothing else can compare
 you're infinite
 you're everywhere
 
 you're everything i can't explain
 you set my heart on fire
 and here i stand amazed
 you take my breath away
 you take my breath away
 
 see me, all i am
 these empty hands
 are all i can give
 that you would die so i'd live
 your sacrifice i can't believe
 
 you fascinate
 you stole my heart
 i can't forget
 and now that i've felt your love
 no turning back, i can't get enough
 
 you're everything i can't explain
 you set my heart on fire
 and here i stand amazed
 you take my breath away
 you take my breath away
 
 the morning breaks
 my soul awakes
 you are my one desire
 and here i stand amazed
 you take my breath away
 you take my breath away
 
 with just one word
 with just one glance
 i'm lost in this divine romance
 and every single day
 more than i can say
 you take my breath away
 
 you're everything i can't explain
 you set my heart on fire
 and here i stand amazed
 you take my breath away
 you take my breath away
 
 the morning breaks
 my soul awakes
 you are my one desire
 and here i stand amazed
 you take my breath away
 you take my breath away
 
 oh, oh, oh
 you take my breath away
 oh, oh, oh
 you take my breath away

 it's that time of year
 when the world falls in love
 every song you hear seems to say
 
 merry christmas
 may your new year's dreams come true
 and this song of mine
 in three quarter time
 wishes you and yours
 the same thing too!
 
 frosted window panes
 
 candles gleaming inside
 painted candy canes on the tree
 just look and you'll see
 
 santa's on his way
 
 he's filled his sleigh
 
 with things
 things for you and for me
 
 it's that time of year
 
 when the world falls in love
 
 every song you hear seems to say
 
 merry christmas
 may your new year's dreams come true
 and this song of mine
 in three quarter time
 wishes you and yours
 the same thing too!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 oh the happiest christmas
 is a homecoming christmas
 with the snow fluttering down 'til the world seems new
 
 
 bright candles burning
 old friends returning
 the wishes of children coming true
 and the happiest wishes are just old fashioned wishes
 may your days be merry, your sorrows be small
 may the ones you love be near you
 that's the happiest christmas of all
 
 repeat chorus
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 when the music fades
 all is stripped away
 and i simply come
 longing just to bring
 something that's of worth
 that will bless your heart
 i'll bring you more than a song
 for a song in itself
 is not what you have required
 you search much deeper within
 through the way things appear
 you're looking into my heart
 
 i'm coming back to the heart of worship
 and it's all about you,
 it's all about you, jesus
 i'm sorry, lord, for the thing i've made it

 no one could express
 how much you deserve
 though i'm weak and poor
 all i have is yours
 every single breath

 sitting alone up in your empty room
 in the stillness of the night
 where all the many dreams that used to carry you
 are no longer in sight
 you put your feelings down in black and white
 a sad, disturbing reply
 that you don't really want to face another night
 so you're saying goodbye
 but do you know that you're saying goodbye
 to a lifetime
 
 well, i've got to tell you there's another way
 to be free to be complete
 but, you've got to make it through another day
 and deny your own defeat 
 and i'm here to tell you there's another way
 to consume a hungry heart
 all the love you need is just a prayer away
 let it in to where you are
 
 you've made it to the edge of seventeen
 thinking now you've reached the end of the line
 but there's so much of life that you have never seen
 now you won't have the time
 you say that you don't hear the music play
 so you're ready to give up the dance
 now that nothing really matters anyway
 oh, you give up your chance
 but do you know that you give up your chance
 at a lifetime
 
 well, i've got to tell you there's another way
 to be free to be complete
 but, you've got to make it through another day
 and deny your own defeat 
 and i'm here to tell you there's another way
 to consume a hungry heart
 all the love you need is just a prayer away
 let it in to where you are
 
 you put your feelings down in black and white
 a sad, disturbing reply
 that you don't really want to face another night
 so you're saying goodbye
 but do you know that you're saying goodbye
 to a lifetime
 
 well, i've got to tell you there's another way
 to be free to be complete
 but, you've got to make it through another day
 and deny your own defeat 
 and i'm here to tell you there's another way
 to consume a hungry heart
 all the love you need is just a prayer away
 let it in to where you are
 
 
 
 
 
 if they were to write about
 the story of my life
 they would have to mention you
 with every page they'd write
 there's another side to every story told
 if i were the ocean
 you would be the shore
 and one without the other one
 would be needing something more
 we are the shadow and the light
 
 
 always love me
  never leave me now
  now you are the other side of me
 always love me
  never leave me now
  now you are the other side of me
 
 i have known the emptiness
 of feeling out of touch
 and living life without you here
 would be living half as much
 cause i've a need that only you can fill
 
 if love was mathematical
 you'd understand the sum
 to the heart's equation
 where one and one makes one
 and lonely equals me minus you
 
 
 
 
 fear not, oh, israel for there is peace still to come
 a word to break the silence, a promise set to bloom
 the promise to redeem us, one to free us
 break this silence in the violence in our lives
 
 emmanuel is sure to find us soon
 the mighty rule to jesse's star of truth
 and bring us unto glory, tell his story
 heal the broken and restore thee to his name
 
 the star will guide us to the humble place
 where christ the king reveals his earthly face
 and we will see emmanuel, god is with us
 god is for us, god is in us, we will see
 
 we're singing hallelujah
 we're singing hallelujah
 emmanuel, our god is with us
 
 we're singing hallelujah
 we're singing hallelujah
 emmanuel, our god is with us
 
 we're singing hallelujah
 we're singing hallelujah
 emmanuel, our god is with us
 
 we're singing hallelujah
 we're singing hallelujah
 emmanuel, our god is with us
 
 emmanuel, our god is with us
 
 
 
 got our feet on a narrow road
 got our eyes on the one who will be our goal
 and our brothers at our side
 if we stumble we won't fall
 if we miss the mark he'll be there after all
 with an everlasting prize
 the race is on
 
 cone on and go
 leave behind the sin you find
 that slows your time
 come on and go
 you know the race is on
 come on and go
 straight ahead be safely led
 by him instead
 come on and go
 you know the race is on
 
 lord i try running my own race
 losin' ground, losin' hope
 losin' sight of your face
 and i'm ready to retire
 
 then i'm back on your solid ground
 you remind me of the strength
 that in you i've found
 and you fill me with your fire
 the race is on
 
 cone on and go
 leave behind the sin you find
 that slows your time
 come on and go
 you know the race is on
 come on and go
 straight ahead be safely led
 by him instead
 come on and go
 you know the race is on
 
 
 i feel it, i feel it, i feel it
 in my bones and i just don't think i can hold it anymore
 
 the river is rising flowing out of me
 and i'm coming alive, i'm coming alive
 
 i'm gonna dance and sing and move my feet
 cause the river is rising, flowing out of me
 
 got to let the world know take it to the streets
 got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise
 
 hallelujah the river is rising
 hallelujah the river is rising
 
 i feel it, i feel it, i feel it
 in my bones and i just don't think i can hold it anymore

 and i'm coming alive, i'm coming alive
 
 i'm gonna dance and sing and move my feet

 got to let the world know take it to the streets
 got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise

 far above the highest heavens
 on a throne of crystal light
 dwells the god of all creation
 rays of wonder crown his might
 human voices blend with the angels
 giving praise to god alone
 heavens music rises upward
 to the lamb upon the throne
 to the lamb upon the throne
 
 
 blessing! glory! sing hallelujah!
 shout the saints of god alone
 honor! power! and dominion!
 praises gather at the throne
 oh, they gather at the crystal throne
 gather at the crystal throne
 
 lightning flashes and thunder echoes
 diamond rainbows fill the sky
 awesome beauty god's provision
 never seen by human eye
 blazing colors show the glory
 of the master artist's plan
 built by god for those who love him
 those who trust the great "i am"
 those who trust the great "i am"
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 when i survey the wondrous cross
 on which the prince of glory died
 my richest gain i count but loss
 and pour contempt on all my pride
 
 see from his head his hands his feet
 sorrow and love flow mingled down
 did e'er such love and sorrow meet
 or thorns compose so rich a crown
 
 oh the wonderful cross
 oh the wonderful cross
 bids me come and die and find
 that i may truly live
 
 oh the wonderful cross
 oh the wonderful cross
 all who gather here
 by grace draw near
 and bless your name
 
 were the whole realm of nature mine
 that were and offering far too small
 love so amazing so divine
 demands my soul my life my all
 
 oh the wonderful cross
 oh the wonderful cross
 bids me come and die and find
 that i may truly live
 
 oh the wonderful cross
 oh the wonderful cross
 all who gather here
 by grace draw near
 and bless your name
 
 
 there is none like you
 no one else can touch my heart like you do
 i could search for all eternity long 
 and find there is none like you
 
 there is none like you
 no one else can touch my heart like you do
 i could search for all eternity long 
 and find there is none like you
 
 there is none like you
 no one else can touch my heart like you do
 i could search for all eternity long 
 and find there is none like you
 
 i could search for all eternity long 
 and find there is none like you
 
 
 when the night
 seems to say
 all hope is lost
 gone away
 but i know
 i'm not alone
 by the light
 she stands
 
 there she waves
 faithful friend
 shimmering stars
 westward wind
 show the way
 carry me
 to the place
 she stands
 
 just when you think it might be over
 just when you think the fight is gone
 someone will risk his life to raise her
 there she stands
 
 there she flies
 clear blue skies
 reminds us with red
 of those that died
 washed in white
 by the brave
 in their strength
 she stands
 
 when evil calls itself a martyr
 when all your hopes come crashing down
 someone will pull her from the rubble
 there she stands
 
 we've seen her flying torn and tattered
 we've seen her stand the test of time
 and through it all the fools have fallen
 there she stands
 
 by the dawn
 early light
 and through the fight
 she stands
 
 
 when the night

 it was a test that we could all hope to pass
 but none of us would want to take
 faced with the choice to deny god and live
 for her there was one choice to make
 
 this was her time
 this was her dance
 she lived every moment
 left nothing to chance
 
 she swam in the sea
 drank of the deep
 embraced the mystery of all she could be
 this was her time
 
 though you are mourning and grieving your loss
 death died a long time ago
 swallowed in life so that life carries on
 still it's so hard to let go
 
 what if tomorrow 
 and what if today
 faced with the question
 oh what would you say
 
 this is your time
 this is your dance
 make every moment
 leave nothing to chance
 
 swim in the sea
 drink of the deep
 call on the mercy
 hear yourself praying
 
 won't you save me
 won't you save me

 who do i hope to finally be
 is it not your life in me
 yet the how's too hard to see
 too many times
 
 will i ever finally be
 the true, intended me
 will the old in me be freed
 and left behind
 
 too many times
 i'm back inside
 wanting desperately to hide
 yet i know, i know you say
 you have to die
 too many times
 you hear my cries
 i'm at the end of all my tries
 so, i'm open lord, so
 teach me how to die
 
 here i am again alone
 afraid i'll lose all that i own
 yet you see me as your own
 i cannot fall
 
 and what i am i still am not
 at times i count the cost
 yet i find there's nothing lost
 if i give it all
 
 too many times
 i'm back inside
 wanting desperately to hide
 yet i know, i know you say
 you have to die
 too many times
 you hear my cries
 i'm at the end of all my tries
 so, i'm open lord, so

 lord, i will lift mine eyes to the hills 
 knowing my help is coming from you 
 your peace you give me in time of the storm
 
 you are the source of my strength 
 you are the strength of my life 
 i lift my hands in total praise to you.
 
 amen, amen 
 amen, amen 
 amen, amen 
 amen, amen
 
 
 maybe there's a light in my soul
 maybe it flickers like a neon sign outside an abandoned hotel
 maybe there are things you just can't know
 but can you say there are no mysteries in the house you choose to dwell
 maybe we are entertaining angels unaware
 maybe there's a place where we will fly
 but some say god is dead like nietzsche said and faith has made me a fool
 but maybe there is more than meets the eye
 who's that stranger there beside you? don't be smug and don't be cruel
 maybe we are entertaining angels unaware
 
 battles of the heart and of the mind
 we stay caught in mental purgatory 'til our existence can be defined
 meanwhile on the shores of parallel
 there may be a holy conference held somewhere discussing all mankind
 maybe we are entertaining angels unaware
 i say maybe we are entertaining angels unaware
 angels unaware
 
 soaring, somewhere, longing, reaching
 searching, knowing, loving, caring
 
 let me take you by the hand
 lead you to the promised land
 and trust him with your heart
 he'll lead you home
 
 
 you breathe in me
 and i'm alive
 with the power of your holiness
 you breathe in me
 and you revive
 feelings in my soul
 that i have laid to rest
 
 so breathe in me
 i need you now
 i've never felt so dead within
 so breathe in me
 maybe somehow
 you can breathe new life
 in me again
 
 i used to be
 so sensitive
 to the light that leads
 to where you are
 
 now i've acquired
 these callouses
 with the darkness of
 a cold and jaded heart
 
 so breathe in me
 i need you now
 i've never felt so dead within
 so breathe in me
 maybe somehow
 you can breathe new life
 in me again

 turn your eyes upon jesus
 look full, in his wonderful face

 turn your eyes upon jesus
 look full, in his wonderful face

 follow the footsteps
 or travel down your own road
 designing your fate
 hear what your heart says
 still you decide which way to go
 your life's an open gate
 
 le bon et le mal
 these are the voices
 we nous somme liberti
 we make the choices
 
 echoes of laughter
 dancing in distant corridors
 with the tears of hearts undone
 dreams we chase after
 give us the key to any door
 we are what we become
 
 le bon et le mal
 these are the voices
 we nous somme liberti
 we make the choices
 
 holding and reaching
 we face the calm, we face the fear
 as we learn to win and lose
 voices are speaking
 still we hear what we want to hear
 our life is ours to choose
 
 le bon et le mal
 these are the voices
 we nous somme liberti
 we make the choices
 
 
 a silent call from a distant land
 crying for a helping hand, so
 how long will it go on?
 ignorance and vanity
 supersede humanity, so
 how long it will go on?
 i want to know how long will it go on?
 
 we can't wait any longer
 they're crying out, doesn't it matter
 we can't wait any longer
 no, no. too long in a slumber
 shake it up,wake it up now.
 we can't wait any longer. no, no.
 
 another child is laid to rest
 another day of hopelessness, so
 how long it will go on?
 and every day we're on the fence brings
 another fatal consequence, so
 how long will it go on?
 i want to know, how long will it go on?
 
 yuko awezayo kusikia kilio chetu? 
 twaomba msaada wenu 
 aweko mwenye kuttuoka 
 aweko mwenye kutupa uhuru

 i can't believe that i'm here
 having to say goodbye.
 and i can barely see you through
 these tears i cry.
 i close my eyes.
 
 
 i can hear the sound
 as angels gather 'round
 saying this is where you belong
 welcome home!
 
 there are the days that my heart aches
 wishing you were here.
 but i know where you are
 the hurt and the pain disappear.
 there's no more tears.
 
 
 
 welcome home!
 
 
 
 what a lovely sound
 angels all around
 saying this is where you belong
 welcome home!
 welcome home!
 welcome home!
 
 
 tears are falling, hearts are breaking
 how we need to hear from god
 you've been promised, we've been waiting
 welcome holy child
 welcome holy child
 
 hope that you don't mind our manger
 how i wish we would have known
 but long awaited holy stranger
 make yourself at home
 please make yourself at home
 
 bring your peace into our violence
 bid our hungry souls be filled
 world now breaking heaven's silence
 welcome to our world
 welcome to our world
 
 fragile finger sent to heal us
 tender brow prepared for them
 tiny heart whose blood will save us
 unto us is born
 unto us is born
 
 so wrap our injured flesh around you
 breathe our air and walk our sod
 rob our sin and make us holy
 perfect son of god
 perfect son of god
 welcome to our world

 word of mouth is the counselor
 there is no need for proof
 in a world that's wired for sound
 the tongue becomes the mighty sword
 that battles the truth
 in a world that's wired for sound
 
 coming on like a tidal wave
 that washes through the brain-a state of mind
 no dispute when the noise is made
 and so it lets the blind lead the blind
 lured by charisma to be swayed to believe
 
 word of mouth is the counselor
 there is no need for proof
 in a world that's wired for sound
 the tongue becomes the mighty sword
 that battles the truth
 in a world that's wired for sound
 
 easier believing what is hard to get rid of than to try
 never searching just accepting
 feeds the mind enough to get you by
 scratching the surface yet to dig deeper down
 
 word of mouth is the counselor
 there is no need for proof
 in a world that's wired for sound
 the tongue becomes the mighty sword
 that battles the truth
 in a world that's wired for sound
 wisdom from the sacred page
 is turned and ignored
 in a world that's wired for sound
 
 
 walk across the shore
 walk across the sea

 and walk with me
 journey through the door

 all the reasons we were made
 who we were meant to be
 
 rise, he's calling you to go
 just leave it all behind
 and rise above
 
 beyond the obvious
 and what you can attain

 more than you can imagine
 it's waiting there for you

 sometimes i wonder what it's like
 to be living life on the other side
 please don't make me feel like i don't know
 what's out there
 proof is written in the sky

 the only absolute is that the word of life
 is written on my heart

 i know you got a heavy kind of soul
 and i know it's harder to believe in love when you're
 feeling all alone

 they're taking on all the things that get you down and out

 the day i looked into your eyes.

 like time was standing still.
 when you said you would be mine.
 
 oh you are a miracle, you're sweeter than i've ever dreamed.
 you're so much more than beautiful.
 how can it be, that you belong to me?
 
 so walk with me awhile,
 and we will spend our lives,
 learning the mysteries of love.
 
 and through the darkest nights
 
 we'll hold each other tight,
 i promise that it will be enough.
 
 oh you are a miracle, you're sweeter than i've ever dreamed.

 i love you, i love you, i love you.
 girl i love you, oh you are, you are more than beautiful.
 how can this be, that you belong to me?
 
 
 made a friend last night or you thought you did
 had a drink, had a talk, took a drive
 shared the night, gave up a part of your soul
 now she's gone and you're a little less alive
 
 shake it off
 never let your feelings begin
 but your defenses are down
 and the fear is closing in
 
 yes, you really need a saviour
 somehow you've known it all along
 yes, you really need a saviour
 you know you've heard it for so long
 
 yes, you really need a saviour
 someone to come and lead you on
 you need a saviour, you need a saviour
 it's time
 
 told yourself today just for your own sake
 what was lost wouldn't cost anyway
 life's a one night stand, this time you'll win
 the up and down, life long game that you play
 
 shake it off
 never let your feelings begin
 but your defenses are down
 and the fear is closing in

 you're alright
 you take a look inside
 but you don't like what you see
 and so you choose to look away
 it doesn't coincide
 with how you'd like to be
 and each glimpse of hope can easily fade
 
 down on your confidence
 it's a fight that won't let go
  you've got to realize
 that you're alright
  under your rubble
 lies a heart the father holds
 and when you see your life
 through his eyes
 you're alright
 
 to learn how he loves you
 is to learn to love yourself
 to live the life he's livin' in you
  what others think of you
 could never measure to the wealth
 of what he's paid and given to you
 
 down on your confidence
 it's a fight that won't let go
  you've got to realize
 that you're alright
  under your rubble
 lies a heart the father holds
 and when you see your life
 through his eyes
 you're alright
 
 
 you're arriving with the sound of thunder and rain
 you're arriving in the calm of the wind and the waves
 you're arriving in the glow of a burning flame
 a burning flame
 
 praise awaits you at the dawn when the world come alive
 praise awaits you in the darkness and shines in the light
 praise awaits you with a song of love and desire, love and desire

 upon the timberline
 you said these mountains were your invention
 and so was this heart of mine
 i heard you whisper on the water,
 there on the mighty sea
 you spoke of love deep as the ocean
 when you spoke of your love for me
 
 i am loved by the father
 i am loved by the son
 it is love that has captured
 the heart of this wayward one
 i heard your laughter in the sunrise,
 amidst the morning birds
 a song of freedom for all creation
 and you sang me every word
 i heard you singing in the silence,
 a simple melody
 words of love, o i can hear it
 my father is very fond of me
 
 
 oh heart of mine why must you stray?
 from one so fair you run away
 and one more time you have to pay
 the heaviness of needless shame

 and he's been there all along
 watching for you down the road

 tell me why 
 i always do, 
 things that i know deep down 
 i don't really want to do. 
 i try to walk in faith 
 but it's not easy with him around 
 ahh, with him around. 
 like when you're walkin' in the dark 
 and you stub your toe. 
 it hurts so bad, makes you mad, 
 and cuss words start to flow. 
 and satan, he's just laughing, 'cause 
 he knows i'm fallin' in despair. 
 i wish he's fight me fair. 
 if the devil was a man 
 with a body just like mine 
 if it wasn't a sin to fight with him, 
 i'd punch him in the eye. 
 he can growl and snarl at me but 
 all to no avail. 
 if the devil was a man, i'd kick his tail. 
 
 sometimes i hear an unholsome tough. 
 and i say things i shouldn't say, 
 when i should probably walk away. 
 and it's a sin i've got spinnin' 
 and satan thinks he's gonna win, 
 aww...think again. 
 i can punch, i can kick. 
 feed him food that makes him sick. 
 if the devil was a man with a body just like mine 
 if it wasn't a sin to fight with him, 
 i'd punch him in the eye. 
 he can growl and snarl at me 
 but all to no avail. 
 if the devil was a man i'd kick his tail. 
 you might think that i'm crazy, 
 you might say that i'm a nut. 
 but if the devil was a man, i'd kick his... 
 but i guess you're wonderin', 
 what kind of spell i'm under 
 singin' songs of silly fantasies. 
 you know that i'm just jokin', 
 there's no better way to hope for 
 'cause i know, greater is he that's alive in me. 
 
  
 
 sometimes my life is full of sin, 
 girl walks by, i look at her, 
 and i look at her again. 
 and i'm too proud to pray out loud 
 and say what i've done wrong, 
 aww that devil's strong. 
 things are lookin' bad for me 
 but i know there's victory. 
 'cause the devil ain't a man 
 with a body just like mine. 
 sometimes he sneaks up on me 
 and hits me from behind. 
 he can growl and snarl at me, 
 but all to no avail. 
 'cause my god's big enough to kick his tail. 
 my god's big enough, 
 my god's big enough, 
 yea, my god's big enough 
 my god's big enough 
  
 my god's big enough 
 my god's big enough 
  
 my god's big enough 
 my god's big enough 
 my god's big enough to kick his little red tail.

 your life and death the endless breath breathing into me
 
 just the mention of your name and i know, i know i've found love
 'cause you're the one
 
 high in a hidden world is where you are found
 where every living thing circles around
 i find myself again where i used to be
 with the rescued ones falling on my knees

 your life and death the endless breath breathing into me

 where's power, the power of the cross in my life?
 i'm not content just to walk through my life
 giving in to the lies walking in compromises
 
 now we cried out as a generation that was lost
 but now is found in the power of the cross
 we believe in you, we believe in the power of the cross and it?s true
 we believe in you, so we lay down the cause that the cross might be found in you
 
 i'm not satisfied living in my own ways
 i'm not satisfied to do church and walk away

 i'm not satisfied oh lord i am crucified in you

 would you believe me if i said
 that we are the ones who can make the change 
 in the world today
 would you believe me if i said 
 that all of the dreams in your heart 
 can come true today
 would you believe me if i said
 that life could be all that you want it to be today
 
 and if i had wings i would fly 
 'cause all that i need you are 
 and if the world caved in around me 
 
 to you i'd still hold on 
 'cause your all that i believe 
 and the one that created me 
 jesus because of you i'm free 
 
 would you believe me if i said
 that god can make miracles happen today
 would you believe me if i said
 that you don't need to wait for the answer before
 you step out in faith 
 would you believe me if i said
 that nothin' is ever impossible for god 
 
 just live you life with god inside
 you won our regret one moment of it 
 and give all that you can for god. for god

 will i was in need
 i needed a friend
 i was alone
 i needed a hand
 i was going down
 but someone rescued me
 my god cares too much to say
 his mercies are new every day
 i get down to pray
 and then help is on it's way
 i walk by faith
 and not by sight
 if things go wrong
 it'll be alright
 'cause someone greater is watching over me
 my god cares too much to say
 his mercies are new every day
 i get down to pray
 and then help is on it's way
 now in faith i believe
 that i've got everything i need
 i walk by faith and not by what i see
 i've got friends in high places
 i've got someone i can call
 i've got someone watching over me

 still your mercy remains
 and should i stumble again
 still i'm caught in your grace

 if love endured that ancient cross
 how precious is my savior's blood
 the beauty of heaven wrapped in my shame
 the image of love upon death's frame
 
 if having my heart was worth the pain
 what joy could you see beyond the grave
 if love found my soul worth dying for
 
 how wonderful, how glorious
 my savior's scars victorious
 my chains are gone, my debt is paid
 from death to life and grace to grace
 
 if heaven now owns that vacant tomb
 how great is the hope that lives in you
 the passion that tore through hell like a rose
 the promise that rolled back death and its stone
 
 if freedom is worth the life you raised

 the skies lay low where you are
 on the earth you rest your feet
 yet the hands that cradle the stars
 are the hands that bled for me
 
 in a moment of glorious surrender
 you were broken for all the world to see
 lifted out of the ashes
 i am found in the aftermath
 
 freedom found in your scars
 in your grace my life redeemed
 for you chose to take the sinner's crown
 as you placed your crown on me
 
 in that moment of glorious surrender
 was the moment you broke the chains in me
 
 lifted out of the ashes
 i am found in the aftermath
 and in that moment you opened up the heavens
 to the broken the beggar and the thief
 lifted out of the wreckage
 i find hope in the aftermath
 
 and i know that you're with me
 yes i know that you're with me here
 and i know your love will light the way
 
 now all i have i count it all as loss
 but to know you and to carry the cross
 knowing i'm found
 in the light of the aftermath

 i've been working, salvation out on my knees
 there is nothing better than knowing
 that we are redeemed
 unbelieving, trusting in creative hands
 i am praying for our world to bow to your plan
 and this one thought is unmistakable
 i take up my cross and follow you lord
 
 when you stand the tall trees and mountains bow
 when you speak the fiercest of oceans is still
 and i see the sinner seek devotion
 the lost become chosen, and i fall to my knees
 
 unforgiven, my savior who did not deserve death
 he was blameless and i was lost in shamefulness
 undelivered, but it doesn't seem right
 unless i keep my eyes focused on the savior who gave his live
 in the middle of a world that denies it believes
 it is breaking apart at the very seams
 there is one thing to be alive for
 and it's to take up my cross and follow you lord

 and i see the sinner seek devotion
 the lost become chosen, and i fall to my knees

 trading your righteousness for shame
 despite all my pride and foolish ways
 caught in your infinite embrace

 with an offering of praise
 i am your servant

 as is fit for the work of your hands

 all of creation resounds with the song
 worship and praise him the lord of lords
 
 spirit now living
 and dwelling within me
 keep my eyes fixed
 ever on jesus' face
 let not the things
 of this world ever sway me
 i'll run till i finish the race

 the tide is turning
 this is redemptions' hour
 in the midst of a world lost for love
 you are all we have now
 the lost returning
 salvation is all around
 in the midst of the world broken down
 you are all we have now
 for you are god and this hope is ours
 
 so father open the skies
 flood the earth with your light
 this is love
 to break the world indifferent
 
 our hearts are burning
 a fire that won't burn out
 in the midst of a world that's grown cold
 you are all we have now
 the earth resounding
 the anthem of your renown
 as we lift up our eyes
 and look to your glory
 
 call us out
 let the world see
 you are god
 and this hope is ours
 so call us out
 let the world see
 you are god, as we sing
 
 father open the skies
 flood the earth with your light
 this is love
 to break the world indifferent
 as we lift up our eyes
 fill our hearts with your fire
 in a world of sin
 we'll be different, the difference
 so call us out
 let the world see
 you are god, and this hope is ours
 
 our eyes are open
 every chain now broken
 in this world
 we are different
 let your love become us
 as we live to make you famous
 in this world
 we are different
 so call us out
 let the world see
 you are god, as we sing
 
 father open the skies
 flood the earth with your light
 this is love
 to break the world indifferent
 as we lift up our eyes
 fill our hearts with your fire
 in a world of sin
 we'll be different, the difference
 so call us out
 let the world see
 you are god, one and only
 in this world
 you are all we have now
 
 
 your faithfullness endures always
 where mountains fall and reason fails
 and you calm the raging seas
 and you calm the storms in me, again
 
 all i know is i find rest in you
 all i know is i find rest in you
 
 my heart will praise throughout the night
 where singing seems a sacrifice
 your grace is all i need
 your grace is all i need
 
 
 my life is a light for your cause
 my will laid aside for your call
 and reserved are the depths of my heart
 only for you
 
 i'm caught in the rhythms of grace
 they overcome all of my ways
 realigning each step everyday
 to live for your glory
 
 there's none beside you god
 there's none beside you god
 
 you're there in the dark of the night
 while holding the sun and it's light
 through the triumph and trials alike
 there's no-one beside you
 
 your voice called the stars by their name
 'cause you whispered them all to their place
 to testify to your wonder and praise
 both now and forever
 
 there's none beside you god
 there's none beside you god
 i love my life to shine your light
 'cause there's none beside you god
 
 no eye has seen
 no ear has heard
 the depths of your love, lord
 no mind can fathom
 the love you deserve
 how great you are
 
 
 god above all the world in motion
 god above all my hopes and fears
 and i don't care what the world throws at me now
 i'm gonna be alright
 
 hear the sounds of the generations
 making loud our freedom song
 all in all that the world would know your name
 it's gonna be alright
 
 cause i know my god saved the day
 and i know his word never fails
 and i know my god made a way for me
 salvation is here
 
 salvation is here
 salvation is here and he lives in me
 salvation is here
 salvation that died just to set me free
 salvation is here
 salvation is here and he lives in me
 salvation is here
 cause you are alive and you live in me
 
 
 and now the weak say i have strength
 by the spirit of power that raised christ from the dead
 and now the poor stand and confess
 that my portion is you and i'm more than blessed
 
 let now our hearts burn with a flame
 a fire consuming all for your son's holy name
 and with the heavens we declare
 you are our king
 
 we love you lord, we worship you
 you are our god, you alone are good
 
 let now your church shine as your bride
 that you soar in your heart as you offered up your life
 let now the lost be welcomed home
 by the saved and redeemed those adopted as your own
 
 let now our hearts burn with a flame
 a fire consuming all for your son's holy name
 and with the heavens we declare
 you are our king
 
 we love you lord, we worship you
 you are our god, you alone are good
 you asked your son to carry this
 the heavy cross, our weight of sin
 
 i love you lord, i worship you
 hope which was lost, now stands renewed
 i give my life to honor this
 the love of christ, the savior king
 
 let now our hearts burn with a flame
 a fire consuming all for your son's holy name
 and with the heavens we declare
 you are our king, for you we sing 
 
 (we love you lord, we worship you
 you are our god, you alone are good)
 
 you asked your son to carry this
 the heavy cross, our weight of sin
 
 i love you lord, i worship you
 hope which was lost, now stands renewed
 i give my life to honor this
 the love of christ, the savior king
